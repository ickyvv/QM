<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boat owners in southeast Bangladesh have made significant profits by picking up refugees and ferrying them across the border to safety, but Bangladeshi security forces are now trying to deter the practice by torching boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the beach at Shahpuri, on the border with Burma, also known as Myanmar,&nbsp;Telegraph&nbsp;saw several fires burning and later saw the charred remains of wooden hulls strewn across the beach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local people told me boatmen caught dropping&nbsp;Rohingya&nbsp;people here are having their boats burned as a punishment and warning. It's deemed necessary as border control,&quot; said Ashiqur Rahman, from Odhikar, a Bangladeshi human rights group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh has been unwilling to officially open its borders to fleeing&nbsp;Rohingya&nbsp;people, but during the visit of Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister, to the border camps last week, she announced that the nation would accept arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the UN General Assembly this week, Ms&nbsp;Hasina said she had not sought any extra help from the US for Bangladesh during a meeting with Donald Trump, and said the country was capable of caring for the influx.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bangladesh is not a rich country ... but if we can feed 160 million people, another 500 or 700,000 people, we can do it,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But border guards at Shahpuri said they were under instruction not to let refugees into the country. It is also illegal for fishing boats to carry passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For people fleeing ongoing violence in Burma, the price of the crossing is negotiable. Arrivals reported paying up to 60,000 Myanmar kyat (&pound;33) per person. Those unable to pay, are selling their cows, often at slashed prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to avoid being caught, boat owners are bringing&nbsp;Rohingya&nbsp;families to a sandy spit at the far end of the beach once the light begins to fade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Border guards sometimes choose to turn a blind eye to the refugees as they wander up the beach, without asking how they were able to cross the water.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family had fled two days earlier. Their village of Nolboniya had been taken over by Burmese soldiers in early September who threatened villagers and fired warning shots in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After many sleepless nights, the family ran away. Looking back, they saw their village in flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't want to come here,&quot; said Mohamed's sister, Amina. &quot;Here we have nothing, nowhere to sleep and nothing to eat. Why bring my children here if I had any other option?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boat crossing cost each family 100,000 Myanmar kyat (&pound;55), a price they were pleased with even though it is more than the nation's minimum monthly wage. &quot;There are hundreds still trapped,&quot; Mohamed said, &quot;If you can't pay for the boat, you can't leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to get relief aid into Rakhine state were hampered by a mob attack on a ship carrying supplies and the crash of a Red Cross truck that killed nine people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) ship carrying 50 tons of aid was halted by a 300-strong Buddhist mob in Sittwe, the state capital, on Wednesday night. The crowd reportedly hurled stones and Molotov cocktails and forced the ship to unload.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC said none of its staff were injured and promised to continue with its work. Meanwhile, a truck hired by the Red Cross and ICRC crashed in Bangladesh, killing nine people and injuring 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">800 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another election and another shock to the system. The election in Germany underlined many of the key trends that are affecting much of Europe more generally - reduced support for the main parties, particularly for social democrats, who in another country have failed to revive their flagging fortunes, strong support for a populist outsider, and greater fragmentation in the governing arrangements that will likely make decision-making harder and consensus more remote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several points to take away from the election but there is no doubt that the strong result for the radical right Alternative for Germany (AfD) should dominate. When all votes had been counted Germany was left facing what it had always feared - an electorally strong radical right party. The result calls into question the old belief that social norms in Germany simply would not allow such a party to establish a strong presence in the Bundestag.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With almost 13 per cent of the vote and more than 90 seats in the Bundestag, the AfD, which campaigned hard against Merkel's handling of the refugee crisis and pledged to curb immigration, now has a national platform. Though Merkel will not admit it, this will change the dynamics of the debate over the refugee crisis, immigration and the responsiveness of politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way, Germany should have seen the shock coming. The AfD had already secured a presence in 13 of Germany's 15 state parliaments and yesterday broke through nationally by mobilising a coalition of non-voters, disgruntled conservatives and alienated workers. It is now the third party nationally but the second most popular in eastern Germany, where it is also the most popular among male voters. Its support was strongest among workers and the unemployed and interestingly remained persistent despite many mainstream conservatives trying to talk tough on immigration and identity politics. &quot;You can't out populist a populist&quot; is one lesson from this campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this mean? It now seems almost certain that the next government will continue with efforts to impose a more restrictive stance on the refugee crisis, tightening Europe's external borders, returning failed asylum-seekers back to their countries of origin, clamping down on NGOs in the Mediterranean, and stepping up plans to process refugees in Northern Africa, rather than Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel might put on a show about not bending to the AfD but the reality is that Europe has already been rowing back from its previously liberal stance on refugees, not least because of fears over populism in Germany, hostility in eastern Europe and in Italy, where an election is on the horizon. Even in the more liberal states such as Sweden the rise of the populist right has clearly fed into a reversal of what was a short-lived open stance toward refugees. Germany will now follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results have other implications for Europe, though not really for Britain. The debate over Brexit is unlikely to be affected by these results, even if the rise of the AfD has demonstrated to Merkel the power of those identity concerns that were central to delivering a majority for the Leave camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the election, there had been hopes that a renewed Merkel-Macron partnership could steer through crunch eurozone reforms and turn what is still a fragile economic recovery into something more solid and, perhaps, enduring. Yet with the social democrats ruling out a grand coalition this will likely leave Merkel dependent on the liberal Free Democratic party and the Greens (the so-called &quot;Jamaica Coalition&quot;). This has complicated the reform agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strong result for the small liberal party, alongside the radical right, is a reminder of how politics is not only swinging to the right but polarising between open and closed. Yet the liberals also oppose President Macron's ideas about what eurozone reform should look like - his ideas on the budget, including the appointment of a eurozone finance minister, and the creation of what would effectively be a rescue fund to help member states that enter economic trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German liberals oppose these ideas and, like many German voters, are very anxious about bailouts and transfers to periphery states (an opposition that would most likely be shared by the newly resurgent AfD). Merkel may have entrenched her status as one of the most successful political figures in post-war European history, eclipsing the electoral achievements of Tony Blair, but for these reasons she will now find herself more restricted than previously, having to respond not only to her new government partners on economics but to a notably stronger populist opposition on the increasingly important issue of identity and what that means in contemporary Europe.Professor Matthew Goodwin is a Senior Visiting Fellow at Chatham House</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 10-year-old refugee, who has attracted global attention and the nickname of &quot;the little Picasso&quot; for his artistic talent, is holding his first exhibition - and donating all the money raised at the event to a sick Serbian boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhad Nouri has been living in a refugee camp with his parents and two younger brothers in Belgrade's Krnjaca neighbourhood for the past eight months. The family was forced to flee conflict and poverty in their home country of Afghanistan two years ago, travelling through Greece and Turkey before arriving in Serbia. They hope to eventually start a peaceful new life somewhere in Western Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhad describes childhood in his temporary home as &quot;very difficult&quot; but says he tries to use art as a release from the suffering because when he draws he can think of nothing else. &quot;Only people here could really understand [how life is]. It's so bad for me,&quot; he told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;If you spent one week in this camp you would be crazy but I feel very good when I'm drawing. I feel better and I don't think about how it was in Afghanistan. When I'm drawing I'm relaxed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picasso, his hero</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spirited 10-year-old, who learned to speak English in just a year, began drawing at six years old after growing up watching his father create arabesque art in Afghanistan. He discovered he had a flair for drawing and has since sold artwork in Greece and Serbia. Farhad continues to hone his technique and spends his days sketching the people who inspire him, including Novak Djokovic, Cristiano Ronaldo, Angela Merkel, Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso - his hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I started to paint at six years old I could not draw like I do now back then,&quot; he said. &quot;Now my favourite thing I like to paint is faces and portraits. I feel very good when I draw these people. Especially Picasso because he is my favourite artist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Farhad, the exhibition is more than just a means of sharing his photographs, drawings and paintings with the world. He wants to use it to change the way people think and that, he says, is why choosing the name of the show was so important to him. He eventually decided to call it &quot;We Need Kindness - The Dream of a Ten-Year-Old&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I'm very happy. When I found out I was having the exhibition I didn't know what to do [because of the excitement]. I spent all day thinking about what the name of it should be. I was talking to my father about being a refugee. He told me how difficult he finds it and I thought, 'do you know what we need? We need kindness'. So I remembered that name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But beyond this noble act, Farhad also wants to use the art show to make a difference to the life of a seven-year-old Serbian boy, whose family are fundraising to help pay for lifesaving treatment at a specialist clinic in Paris. When he heard about his story he knew he had to do something to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want any children in the world to be afraid of anything,&quot; he said. &quot;Because of that I decided I won't sell my paintings for lots of money but instead I will put a box out and anyone who wants to donate can give for the sick boy. We need that kindness. I want to help him and to show other people how they can help him and show their kindness. I can understand people and I think we all need kindness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition, which opens at the Slow Caf&eacute; in Belgrade on Wednesday 9 August, has been organised in collaboration with Help Refugees, Refugees Foundation Serbia and Serbian photography school Fabrika Fotografa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sian Pilkington, a field representative at Help Refugees said: &quot;Farhad is an intelligent boy with extraordinary talent, we are very happy to celebrate his artwork. It's a fantastic opportunity to reflect on a positive story rather than the negative stories of the refugee crisis that are in the media. We hope that Farhad is given all the opportunities that any 10-year-old deserves to achieve his dreams in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

It's so bad for me,&quot; he told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;If you spent one week in this camp you would be crazy but I feel very good when I'm drawing. I feel better and I don't think about how it was in Afghanistan. When I'm drawing I'm relaxed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picasso, his hero</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spirited 10-year-old, who learned to speak English in just a year, began drawing at six years old after growing up watching his father create arabesque art in Afghanistan. He discovered he had a flair for drawing and has since sold artwork in Greece and Serbia. Farhad continues to hone his technique and spends his days sketching the people who inspire him, including Novak Djokovic, Cristiano Ronaldo, Angela Merkel, Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso - his hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I started to paint at six years old I could not draw like I do now back then,&quot; he said. &quot;Now my favourite thing I like to paint is faces and portraits. I feel very good when I draw these people. Especially Picasso because he is my favourite artist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Farhad, the exhibition is more than just a means of sharing his photographs, drawings and paintings with the world. He wants to use it to change the way people think and that, he says, is why choosing the name of the show was so important to him. He eventually decided to call it &quot;We Need Kindness - The Dream of a Ten-Year-Old&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I'm very happy. When I found out I was having the exhibition I didn't know what to do [because of the excitement]. I spent all day thinking about what the name of it should be. I was talking to my father about being a refugee. He told me how difficult he finds it and I thought, 'do you know what we need? We need kindness'. So I remembered that name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But beyond this noble act, Farhad also wants to use the art show to make a difference to the life of a seven-year-old Serbian boy, whose family are fundraising to help pay for lifesaving treatment at a specialist clinic in Paris. When he heard about his story he knew he had to do something to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want any children in the world to be afraid of anything,&quot; he said. &quot;Because of that I decided I won't sell my paintings for lots of money but instead I will put a box out and anyone who wants to donate can give for the sick boy. We need that kindness. I want to help him and to show other people how they can help him and show their kindness. I can understand people and I think we all need kindness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition, which opened at the Slow Caf&eacute; in Belgrade on Wednesday 9 August, has been organised in collaboration with Help Refugees, Refugees Foundation Serbia and Serbian photography school Fabrika Fotografa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sian Pilkington, a field representative at Help Refugees said: &quot;Farhad is an intelligent boy with extraordinary talent, we are very happy to celebrate his artwork. It's a fantastic opportunity to reflect on a positive story rather than the negative stories of the refugee crisis that are in the media. We hope that Farhad is given all the opportunities that any 10-year-old deserves to achieve his dreams in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurul Afsar is one of the many entrepreneurial Bangladeshis who is thriving as a result of the human crisis on his doorstep. &quot;I am very happy,&quot; says Afsar, 27. &quot;Everyone is profiting, every car, every vehicle. I know a bamboo seller who makes twice what he used to.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afsar, from nearby Ukhiya, drives Rohingya refugees in and around Kutupalong refugee camp on his blue motorbike taxi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His income has more than doubled since the Rohingya refugee crisis began in August. More than 620,000 people have fled violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state, arriving in the Cox's Bazar district of southern Bangladesh. With them have come new economic opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'It was unbelievable horror': the Rohingya crisis - podcast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once upon a time, there were no refugees here and the road was bad, and I didn't like to come here even if I was paid 500 taka [&pound;4.50],&quot; says Afsar. &quot;But now, the road is OK and there are so many passengers - so I love to work here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the current crisis, Afsar says, on a good day, he could make 1,000 taka (&pound;9). &quot;Now, I make at least 2,000 to 2,500 taka [&pound;18-22] on a normal day.&quot; The annual per capita income in Bangladesh is &pound;1,200, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kutupalong, the most populous camp, a bustling market area known as Lamba Chiya Bazar has sprung up in a matter of weeks. Stalls and shacks line the road, selling everything from food to clothing and electrical goods. And practically everywhere stocks betel nuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdul Shakkur, 35, runs an eatery nearby. He returned to his native Ukhiya with savings after eight years working as a labourer in Dubai, and set up his business almost two months ago. &quot;Earlier there were no refugees, but then the market started and I thought it would be a good idea to sell food here,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But few Rohingya eat there - they are largely reliant on food aid. It is other Bangladeshi vendors who come for lunch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shakkur paid 8,000 taka for the site, and now employs three staff, who receive 700 taka a day. He makes a daily profit of 1,000 to 1,500 taka, which is &quot;enough to provide for my wife and parents&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the small number of Rohingya who run businesses, the picture is bleaker. Mir Kashim, 70, from Foira Bazar in Maungdaw township in Myanmar, has a stall with a dirt floor and homemade benches. For two months, he has sold tea, cigarettes, pulses and betel nut. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I brought some money from Myanmar, which I changed for 500 taka,&quot; Kashim says. &quot;Then we got a loan of 4,000 taka from our community to pay for the land. We are repaying it now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every morning, Kashim buys goods on credit from wholesalers in Kutupalong and repays them in the evening. He also pays the landowner, a local government official who controls the area, 10 to 20 taka a day. Other Rohingya businesses do the same. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kashim's little shop makes between 200 and 300 taka a day, and supports five families. &quot;We are just managing to get by,&quot; he says. &quot;There are some in the camp who don't even make one taka.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other refugees have sold jewellery or received money from relatives abroad to start their businesses. As Rohingya refugees are not allowed to travel, they can only buy goods from wholesalers in the towns around which the camps are built. As a result, prices have increased. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the best profit of my life,&quot; says Montudash, 40, who owns Baba Mayer Archibad shop in Balukhali bazar. &quot;Before the Rohingya came, I made just 7,000 to 8,000 taka a day. The situation was terrible, I couldn't look after my kids. But now, it is normal to make 18,000 taka a day. If my child asks for 10 taka, I give him 15.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montudash estimates that 95% of his customers are refugees, who buy everything from pots to cables to soft drinks. &quot;It was very quiet before the new influx,&quot; he says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya entrepreneurs have to deal with extortive wholesalers and thugs from nearby villages who frequently threaten to destroy their shops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have little choice. &quot;We can't do anything here - it's like in Myanmar,&quot; says Taher Udin, 18, from his shop, Lamba Chiya. &quot;But if we didn't have this business we would have to suffer like the others.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency situation in Rakhine State, Burma, has worsened since 25 August when violent clashes began between minority factions and Burmese militants, resulting in a reported 1,000 plus fatalities and the displacement of hundreds of thousands. The United Nations estimates that more than 400,000 men, women and children have fled Burma for refuge in Bangladesh since the violence erupted, with thousands more arriving each day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef estimates that 50,000 of the new arrivals to Bangladesh are pregnant women and an &quot;unprecedented&quot; 60 per cent of new refugees in Bangladesh are children. Many are malnourished and injured, having walked for days in search of sanctuary. At least 1,267 children have been separated from their families and are at particular risk of human trafficking, sexual abuse, child labour and child marriage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've just returned from Bangladesh where I joined a team to assess the need on the ground and see how Islamic Relief can help these displaced people. I met some of them when I joined my colleagues in the southern fishing port of Cox's Bazar, before heading further south on the Naf River. Here, thousands of refugees are fleeing Burma by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Bangladesh, if you look east to a ridge of tree-covered mountains, Burma is close enough to make out buildings and lights. In Teknaf, the southernmost city on mainland Bangladesh, we walked to a crossing point used by the refugees. There we found a dozen narrow wooden boats, which were collecting and dropping off groups of people carrying their few hastily-gathered possessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Teknaf crossing I met Muhammad Rafiq, his wife Nuru, and their four children. The family fled their home as the conflict erupted and the river crossing was the second step on their journey through the border area. Muhammad was accompanied by several members of his village and they all provided mutual support to each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holding his two-year-old son, Noyum, in his arms, Muhammad told me: &quot;We left in the middle of the night. We had time only to grab our children. We left everything behind.&quot; Noyum had a fever and was semi-conscious. Muhammad needed to complete the next part of his journey quickly as his son required immediate medical attention. However, Noyum had to compete with hundreds of others at this crossing with similar needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Tayum Kali refugee camp, roughly 4km from the Burmese border, I met Soydul Amin, who arrived in Bangladesh on 12 September with five family members. He had to flee overnight and, like the others I met, also left his life possessions behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soydul has shown incredible resolve by clearing part of a hillside then levelling it out using hand tools - aiming to, quite literally, build a new home for his uprooted family. He has built a shelter frame out of bamboo, covering it with plastic sheeting purchased from the local market. A resolute Soydul told me: &quot;My family and I will clear this land and make a shelter. We will support each other and others around us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these refugees are self-sufficient and stoic individuals, determined to make the best of a bad situation. While this independent spirit is essential to get refugees through the chaos and confusion of their arrival in Bangladesh, it will be down to NGOs, such as Islamic Relief, for the most part to provide them with improved shelter units, water, sanitation and food. Many of these refugee settlements are on hilltops. In early December - just over two months away - the temperature will drop dramatically and these makeshift shelters will prove inadequate for the coming winter months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is vital that the international community comprehends their plight and responds in their hour of need. Now back home in England, I cannot help but wonder whether Noyum received the medical treatment he so urgently needed. At the point where so many are seeking a new life away from sectarian violence, for too many it has marked the end of theirs. Surely their life is too high a price for anyone to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imran Madden is the UK director of Islamic Relief, which has launched an emergency appeal for Burma</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These kits ensure that Rohingya families - particularly women and children - can at least meet their personal care and hygiene needs as they face the harsh reality of life in the makeshift settlements,&quot; Sarat Dash, International Organization for Migration's (IOM) Bangladesh Chief of Mission said on Tuesday.<BR><BR>The kits, which also include hygienic cloths, menstrual hygiene products, undergarments, and other small personal items, are funded by the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).<BR><BR>To date, IOM has distributed 6,626 hygiene kits to the most vulnerable families, reaching an estimated 33,130 people among those that have arrived in Bangladesh after fleeing violence in Myanmar's Northern Rakhine state.<BR><BR>The kits are part of a $ 5 million CERF contribution to fund IOM shelter, health, water, sanitation and hygiene operations in Cox's Bazar.<BR><BR>&quot;CERF funding has been critical to saving lives in this humanitarian crisis. It has allowed us to scale up and respond to the escalating needs of Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar in a very short timeframe,&quot; Mr. Dash stressed.<BR><BR>An estimated 603,000 refugees have arrived in the Cox's Bazar district of southern Bangladesh since August - joining some 200,000 others already sheltering in the settlements.

Many have experienced devastating physical and emotional trauma.<BR><BR>Committing to help<BR><BR>On Monday, IOM, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) organized a pledging conference in Geneva co-hosted by the European Union and the Government of Kuwait.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's top court has rejected legal action by Hungary and Slovakia to avoid accepting refugees under an EU relocation scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a long-awaited ruling, the European Court of Justice said that it had &quot;dismissed in its entirety the actions brought by Slovakia and Hungary&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU countries agreed in September 2015 to relocate 160,000 refugees from Greece and Italy over two years, but only around 27,700 people have been moved so far. Hungary and Slovakia were seeking to have the legally binding move annulled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary and Poland have refused to take part in the scheme, while so far Slovakia has accepted only a handful of refugees from Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee scheme was adopted by the EU's &quot;qualified majority&quot; vote - around two thirds - and the ECJ held that this was appropriate, saying the EU &quot;was not required to act unanimously&quot; on this decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also noted that the small number of relocations so far is due to a series of factors that the EU could not really have foreseen, including &quot;the lack of cooperation on the part of certain member states&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico said he respected the court decision but that his government still does not like the relocation scheme, which some see as a system of quotas imposed on countries by unelected EU bureaucrats in Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We fully respect the verdict of the European Court of Justice,&quot; Mr Fico told reporters, adding that his country's negative stance on the relocation plan &quot;has not changed at all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Fico said the scheme was a temporary solution. He said he believes his country does not face any sanctions from the EU over its stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU officials say the relocation of eligible asylum-seekers in Greece and Italy will continue even after the scheme ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's foreign minister welcomed the ruling. Sigmar Gabriel said he expects all EU countries to implement the decision &quot;without further hesitation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Gabriel said the ruling confirms that the solidarity measure approved by EU leaders is not just in keeping with European values but also adheres fully to European law. He said &quot;solidarity is not a one-way street&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights group Amnesty International welcomed the ruling, saying Hungary and Slovakia had been trying to turn their countries into &quot;refugee-free zones&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, an advocate for asylum-seekers, urged Hungary to give refugees an opportunity to make their case for asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lesson of the verdict is that helping people fleeing war and terror is truly a common responsibility for Europe,&quot; the group said. &quot;Hungary needs to respect the decision of the EU court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beside Hungary's legal arguments against the EU plan, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has also made the case and the issue the focal point of its political activities since early 2015 and ahead of parliamentary elections expected in April 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary's position is that only its elected leaders should be able to decide who is allowed into the country. Mr Orban has said that the large influx of mainly Muslim immigrants threatens Europe's and Hungary's cultural identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From mid-September 2015, Hungary closed off its southern border first with Serbia and later with Croatia, with a fence protected by razor wire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fences have mostly stopped migrants from passing through Hungary on their way to Western Europe but Hungary has also greatly reduced the chances for asylum seekers to submit applications for protection in the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the pressure from the international community has been intensifying on Myanmar, the border with Bangladesh remains a treacherous and congested route to safety for thousands of Rohingya fleeing for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a week of social action with the Conservative Friends of Bangladesh, I have spent time with MPs and volunteers in and around the camps in Cox's Bazar speaking to people who have been displaced from their burnt-out villages, aid workers and Bangladeshi government ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One was a 60-year-old lady in Kutupalong refugee camp, holding her grandchild. Her son-in-law had been stabbed in front of them. Village children were beheaded. Other young boys had their genitals mutilated, suggesting that this was to stop the Rohingya population reproducing. In one of many health clinics at the camp, seeing an old man being treated for a deep gash, a young man was then brought in on a makeshift stretcher with blood pouring from his head. A family member told me that they were eating earlier that morning in Burma when they were attacked by men with axes and machetes. They escaped across the border and got treatment within hours at the camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days of solid rain have made the route across the border even more perilous. When we visited the Gundhum border area yesterday, 5,000 refugees were camping on a river bank in a designated &quot;no man's land&quot; between Burma and Bangladesh, able to ford the river to get food. Arriving today after 24 hours of stormy weather, we saw a body being dragged out of the surging river which had risen by at least six feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bangladeshi soldier manning the border was frank, telling us how he had seen Burmese military digging there the previous week and drones being flown over the trees filming the refugees from the Burmese side. He had video of a lady who had lost her leg after stepping on a landmine four days before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what the Bangladeshi authorities are having to deal with each day. Five thousand refugees are registering in Kutapalong every day. The Bangladeshi government has just allocated another 2,000 acres for the camp to expand. The area was so big, a lady with an ill four-year-old child was refusing to seek treatment because she was waiting for her husband who had gone to Cox's Bazar to look for work. She feared that he would not be able to find them again in the sprawl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 80,000 pregnant women in Cox's Bazar and 13,000 orphans. Doctors said that they were treating mainly diarrhoea and malnutrition but saw several gunshot wounds. The authorities had taken to driving vans with loudhailers encouraging people to register so that they could get the help they needed. We saw makeshift camps that had become flooded. Even in the camps, 100 houses had been swept away in a landslide. As the forest is cut back further to provide more land for shelter, the bare earth is exposed to the heavy rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities and NGOs are at breaking point but are working incredibly hard. They are reacting to a fast-moving situation with 420,000 refugees descending on a small, hard-pressed region. We saw the Union flag symbolising the contribution of UK Aid through the department for international development; the UN refugee agency, the International Organisation on Migrants; US Aid as well as support from Turkey and Saudi Arabia, all trying to cope with this man-made crisis exacerbated by terrible weather conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their worst-case scenario is that all 1.3 million Rohingya come over the border, the best is that the Burmese military stops its disproportionate response to attacks from the minority militant group ARSA and support those who have lived in Myanmar for generations. There may be some instances of civil uprising. If there is, no one with any value for life can think the answer is the mass eradication of a whole community through such barbaric methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the violence has escalated, this is not a new problem. Kutapalong has been a camp for displaced people for at least two decades. We did need to hear stronger words from Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's state counsellor, in her speech this week but she is also right that the country needs to be looked at as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrible crimes against humanity have occurred in nearly every state in Burma over the past seven decades and the peace process is having an effect in many parts. The country has just seen the first chink of light with a return to being part of the international community once more. Side-lining Ms Suu Kyi at this stage risks that light being extinguished and a return to full military rule with little reporting of the atrocities that will surely continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commander in chief, General Min Aung Hlaing, is the man who can stop this today. I hope that Britain will take a lead on drawing international attention to him with a view to bringing this dark chapter of Burmese history to an end so that the Rohingya community can return to its safe homeland and Myanmar can continue its journey of development. Alongside this, we must remember the humanity and daily struggle of these victims on both sides of the border.Paul Scully is Conservative MP for Sutton and Cheam</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadia Naffi: 'People need to understand where their political tolerance or intolerance is coming from.'<BR><BR>Montreal, September 27, 2017 - Education researcher Nadia Naffi, made a promising discovery when she adapted cutting-edge interview techniques traditionally used in constructivist psychology as part of her ongoing study of how social media shapes young people's attitudes toward refugees.<BR><BR>'During one-on-one interviews with teens and young adults, participants reflected more thoughtfully on their own reactions to Facebook posts about Syrian refugee resettlement, and they sought to better understand the attitudes of others,' says Naffi, a Concordia PhD candidate and 2017 SSHRC Storytellers competition winner.<BR><BR>'In as little as three or four hours, we saw empathy for the refugees emerge, as well as empathy for those who feel differently.'<BR><BR>Naffi's findings were published in the journal Personal Construct Theory &amp; Practice this fall.<BR><BR>The article is co-authored with Naffi's supervisor, Ann-Louise Davidson, associate professor of education in the Faculty of Arts and Science and Concordia University Research Chair in Maker Culture.<BR><BR>Methodology breakthrough<BR><BR>'The interviews triggered something in the participants,' Naffi explains.<BR><BR>'They wanted to get more involved, not just be passive bystanders when faced with posts they considered intolerant or racist. They decided to express themselves online in order to share another perspective.'<BR><BR>Building on earlier stages of the study, Naffi acted on an interdisciplinary hunch.<BR><BR>She adapted four interview techniques from personal construct psychology (PCP), which posits that people understand the world not directly, but indirectly by creating personal constructs to anticipate what comes next, which guides their behaviors and attitudes.<BR><BR>The specific PCP interview protocols Naffi used were George Kelly's self-characterization technique, H.G. Proctor's perceiver element grid, Kelly's repertory grid test and N.D. Hinkle's laddering technique.<BR><BR>The interview techniques Naffi used helped participants understand their perceptions about Syrian refugees. The tools also allowed the interviewees to step into the refugees' shoes and see things from their perspective. This is where the empathy emerged.<BR><BR>Naffi conducted the interviews - some online - with 20 Canadians between 16 and 24 years old and 22 youth from other countries.<BR><BR>Critical thinking in troubled times<BR><BR>Participants experienced several 'a-ha' moments, including the realization that their reluctance to be part of the online conversation was actually harming Syrian refugees because, most of the time, only anti-resettlement opinions were being shared.<BR><BR>The results suggest that this type of interview protocol is an effective learning tool. Naffi's research shows that it can allow youth from host societies to engage in critical thinking and to learn to live with the one they perceive as being 'the other.'<BR><BR>According to Naffi, the timing is right for this kind of discovery.<BR><BR>'In this troubled time, people need to understand where their political tolerance or intolerance is coming from.'<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than 20 days of resilience in a harsh situation, having no food, water and medication, refugees in Manus prison were forced to a new camp. The transfer was conducted by absolute force and, as always, the Australian government denies the truth and has declared it a &quot;voluntary and peaceful&quot; transfer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, what we experienced - and what the huge volume of footage and photos distributed in the news and social media reveal - is something different from the government's claim. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia's offshore detention regime is a brutal and obscene piece of self-delusion | Ben Doherty and Helen Davidson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day before the &quot;massive transfer&quot;, while I was handcuffed and kept at the back of the prison, I personally witnessed that in Mike compound (one of the four camps of Manus prison), a group of officers attacked people with metal poles and sticks and, after just a few minutes, forced 40 refugees onto two buses and transferred them to the new camp using violence. They dragged one of the refugees while he was vomiting. After a while, he was transferred by an ambulance. He stayed at a local medical centre for three days and rumours about his death spread around the camp, making us dreadfully worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike compound was shut violently, and officers raided other camps and besieged Fox compound to give them more control over the situation. One of the refugees who was moved to the new camps along with 40 others described what had happened:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When they attacked, I hid under one of the containers for a few hours, I was trapped by fear. In the darkness of the night, when police and locals were transferring people, or more precisely, were plundering refugees' belongings, I was found by police's dog and dragged out violently by police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This setting reminds me of the 2014 riot more than anything. It reminds me of absolute brutality in Mike compound  when Australian officers, along with locals, attacked and Reza Barati was murdered. Every person's life matters. I vividly remember that some of the refugees had been hiding under the containers due to well-founded fear for 48 hours. They were about to faint when they got out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is obvious is that the violence has not only been physical; it has been a series of actions conducted by police and immigration officers, from filling our well with rubbish and damaging our water tank to destroying our personal belongings and removing our beds and shelters; all happening in front of our eyes while we watched them silently. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their verbal abuse, addressing us with insulting terms, was their tactic to try to provoke us to become like them; become violent. But from our long experience of living in the prison camp we knew that we would continue to watch them and only watch them in deep silence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was sunset when the Mike compound was shut and there were still 300 people in the camp. Next day, early in the morning, they returned. Metal poles in hand, they entered the camp and called out the names of some of the refugees, supposedly &quot;the leaders,&quot; telling them to identify themselves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again there was our silence and their violence; they attacked the men who were gathered in Delta compound, beating the men with hands, feet, wooden sticks and whatever was available to them, and in minutes forced the men to get into the buses. When the four buses arrived in Lorengau after driving 24km, dozens of men appeared out of the buses with bruises and blood on their bodies. Men were scared but, more than this, were traumatised. There is one reflection that has been communicated between all: it is so hard and painful to be beaten and insulted in such a manner after years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of men, still traumatised by this violence, were transferred to the East Lorengau camp. This camp has a capacity of 280 people, but by the end of the day they had relocated almost 400 men there. About 60 people remained homeless for two days. Eventually police relocated 25 of these 60 men to a classroom, which the men have had to fit out themselves as best they can in order to sleep there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I went to West Haus camp, workers and construction equipment were still operating. A large number of containers were distributed throughout a field the size of a soccer pitch in the middle of a jungle. Last night it rained, creating red mud throughout the camp, making it difficult to walk. It was like hell created for the &quot;exiled dangerous criminals&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island: MSF denied access to refugees as thousands rally in Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw a large number of relocated men with bruises and wounds on their bodies, clearly caused by their recent beatings with metal poles. I visited a man, semi-naked and with bare feet, sitting in the dirt. His face was bloody. I spoke with him, but he was completely silent. Others told me that police had beaten him, he had lost his personal belongings, and they killed his dog that had been living with him. Witnessing this man's story was too much to bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I went to Hillside camp. It is in the middle of a tropical forest, but they cut all the trees and built the camp there. There is no electricity and water there yet. Workers are still constructing the buildings. It is a metal structure at the top of a small hill. There also I became so depressed and disappointed. On the same day, Medecins Sans Frontieres were at Manus prison, with doctors trying to see the injured refugees but the immigration officials did not approve or permit them to enter the prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian and PNG governments eventually succeeded in shutting the Lombrum camp by force. Really, they have only succeeded in transferring this long lasting problem 24km away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the reality of life for men in these Manus camps. They have entered into another stage of suffering and this new phase means living without security. The internal suffering, the emotional trauma, is the hardest to endure. There are no psychiatric facilities in Manus, but there is more need now than ever before as the men feel that they have been abandoned; they are desperate, lonely. The feeling of isolation has surrounded them and I am worried.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly 2,000 people remain on Australia's offshore processing islands of Nauru and Manus, and figures released under Senate estimates questioning show that the two camps have cost $4.895bn to build and run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the costs are borne by Australia, which maintains effective control over both centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus centre - ruled illegal by Papua New Guinea's supreme court 15 months ago - will close on 31 October under pressure from the PNG government and from the private contractors running the centre, who have refused to continue working there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nauru camp will continue to run but that country's government has consistently refused to offer permanent resettlement to refugees, instead offering 20-year visas with restrictions on travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed resolution for Australia's offshore refugee population, the US deal to resettle refugees from Australia's Nauru and Manus operations in America, has foundered, with the US hitting its 50,000 cap for refugee resettlement this year and officials abruptly leaving their on-island interviews on Nauru two weeks early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one held under Australia's offshore regime has been resettled under the US program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the US and Australian governments have said the deal remains on track but details of the agreement are unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one held under Australia's offshore regime has been resettled under the US program and the deal does not commit the US to taking a single refugee if it deems they have not passed &quot;extreme vetting&quot;, a threshold that has never been defined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian officials have conceded that, even if the US resettlement program does go ahead, it will not clear the detention centres, leaving &quot;a balance&quot; on the two islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus detention centre is being progressively shut down with more than 800 men still housed there. Buildings have been closed off, power shut off, activities stopped and people forcibly moved from their dormitories. There are reports there is no more running water in parts of the camp and those within are reliant on bottled water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the camp closing around them, many of those in the detention centre are refusing to leave, saying they will not be safe in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PNG prime minister, Peter O'Neill, said the American deal remained a viable solution to close the camp but said his government was &quot;looking at all options&quot; for the men in the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Law Centre'sDaniel Webb said offshore detention had run &quot;four years too many&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a series of interviews with Webb, men in detention have said they faced uncertain futures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I feel like everything the Australian government is doing is designed to force us to go home or go into PNG. They are squeezing us out of the camp but not to the airport where they will take us to safety. They are squeezing us into the PNG community where we are not safe. - Amir, 23, Iran</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation here is getting worse and worse. They have shut down classrooms. Closed the gym. They tell us every day that we can't stay here. They say go back to your country or go to the transit centre. But we aren't safe out there in the community. That is the worst thing - they are trying to push us somewhere where we will not be safe. - Madu, 23, stateless Rohingya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We've had so many hard times. We've been attacked, we've been punched and we've been fired at with shotguns. My friend, Reza, was killed. He was a gentle man. But they didn't care who we were. - Farhard, 36, stateless Kurd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Webb said the US deal initially gave those on those islands some hope that &quot;finally our government was conceding it couldn't just abandon them there forever&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'We have nothing to live for': anguish of family split by detention system</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's now eight months since the deal was announced and not a single refugee has been resettled,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of the men on Manus haven't even had an initial interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line is that no one is likely to go to the US anytime soon and many now seem unlikely to ever go at all. Two-thousand lives remain on a painful pause with no end in sight. One hundred and sixty-nine childhoods are being spent surrounded by suffering and despair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After four years, enough is well and truly enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said on the weekend the US deal was &quot;progressing as we expected&quot;, saying there had not been any delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is upholding the agreement,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said the US deal had stalled and those held on Australia's offshore islands had been &quot;living on false hopes for eight months already&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now those hopes have been dashed again,&quot; he said. &quot;It is time for the Turnbull government to end the pretence of the US deal and act immediately to bring them all the asylum seekers and refugees to Australia.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Ronald, the chief executive of Save the Children, the child welfare agency that formerly worked on Nauru, said that, even if the US deal remained a possibility, the current situations on Nauru and Manus were untenable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the men on Manus haven't even had an initial interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Daniel Webb, Human Rights Law Centre    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Australian government is undeniably responsible for the health and welfare of those who it has transferred offshore,&quot; he said. &quot;Refugees on Nauru and Manus Island can no longer remain in limbo. Prime minister Turnbull should immediately bring them to safety in Australia while they await resettlement in the US or until another safe and sustainable alternative can be secured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the Australian government agreed to pay $70m in compensation to the Manus Island detainees, who sought damages in the Victorian supreme court for illegally detaining them in dangerous and harmful conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In agreeing to the record payout, the government did not concede liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a hastened effort under way to get the payout money to the 1905 men enjoined to the class action before Manus is closed, because it may be difficult to find them after that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vigils will be held across the country to mark four years since the alteration to Australian policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been the most regular departure point for migrants and refugees attempting to reach Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrants coming from across Africa told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they usually pay smugglers between $1,700 (&pound;1,300) and $2,200 (&pound;1,700) for the dangerous sea journey from Libya to Italy. However, many are captured by militias inside Libya, some of whom hold them hostage while demanding more money from their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon McMahon, a University of Conventry research fellow who has written extensively aboutthe migration crisis, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thatthe latest reports highlight some of the complexities European countries face when it comes to working with the government in Tripoli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These groups may be trying to get access to funds for migration control coming from Europe or trying to position themselves as legitimate partners for future developments. Whether they will continue to play this role, face competition from others who wish to restore smuggling routes or will change their minds and take part in facilitating smuggling, rather than preventing it, is something we will have to wait to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central Mediterranean route is currently the deadliest way to Europe. So far in 2017, more than 2,400 people have drowned or gone missing while crossing the Mediterranean, mostly while travelling from Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 600,000 migrants and refugees have made the journey since 2014, while around 12,000 have died on the way. Italy has repeatedly asked for help from other EU countries in managing the burden caused by the migrants and refugees who do arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14 July,5,115 migrants arrived to Italy within one day, the highest number so far in 2017, but there hasn't been a major spike since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said he was thankful for the drop in arrivals, calling it a &quot;light at the end of the tunnel&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Italy -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who face elections early next year - are under pressure domestically to reduce migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of their efforts, Italy has been trying to discourage nongovernmental organisations from running search-and-rescue missions off the Libyan coast, and has attempted to cement a formal deal with Libya to stop departures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy and the EU have also been providing training and resources for the Libyan coastguard in a bid to encourage them to intercept boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights groups and humanitarian workers have condemned the attempts, pointing out that Libya has no stable government, and is instead governed by rogue militias guilty of abusing and profiteering from migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent report by British charity Oxfam found that 84 percent of refugees and migrants who have come through Libya suffered inhuman or degrading treatment, extreme violence or torture there. Some 80 percent were regularly denied food and water, while 70 percent said they had been tied up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2016 UN report documented sexual abuse, beatings, forced labour and malnutrition inside Libyan immigration detention centres.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article that discusses immigration without mentioning refugees does not add much to the debate (&quot;It's not racist to have fears over immigration&quot;, David Quinn, Comment, last week).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I like to think that Angela Merkel's welcome for refugees was informed by her knowledge of her country's history in creating millions of them in the middle of the last century. My welcome for her efforts was due to the rigidly uncompromising attitude Ireland adopted to the resettlement of persecuted Jewish refugees in the war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course we need to distinguish economic migrants from those fleeing great danger. Of course we cannot have totally open borders. The EU, on whose behalf we police part of the western frontier, also knows that. However, if Germany and other EU states can show compassion for refugees coming from outside the EU, then I support their efforts. Seamus McKenna, Dublin 14 The secret is out There is a secrecy and slyness about government policy regarding immigration. We are seeing the effect of a huge increase in population on a country which isn't set up to deal with it. The huge pressure on housing inevitably leads to a spike in prices. As people's wages haven't risen commensurately, they have to set aside an enormous portion of what they earn to have a roof over their head. Mark O'Higgins, Dublin 8 Identity crisis Quinn articulated the concerns privately held by people in almost the same manner as that expressed by our neighbours at the Brexit ballot box. Most people have a problem with uncontrolled open-door immigration. This has nothing to do with racism but with a desire for identity, belonging, a sense of history, culture and common mindset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU must revisit immigration and free movement if the rise of the far right and copycat exiteering is to be avoided. Edmond O'Sullivan, Midleton, Co Cork Feeling the strain Quinn says he always deals in facts then talks about the &quot;evident strain that is being placed on our infrastructure by mass immigration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry, no, there is no such strain caused by &quot;mass immigration&quot;. It is due to massive economic growth, along with a refusal to tax any but a small proportion of those at the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are a low-tax, high-spend country, which uses the value added by highly skilled immigrants as a cash cow, and directs all tax raising at these people. Stephen Barrett, Dublin Dark age While couched in seemingly temperate and logical rhetoric, Quinn's piece has a dark underbelly - scaremongering and blaming. He patronisingly tells us that &quot;the average person doesn't have the basic facts and figures&quot; in relation to immigration and then uses random numbers from the ESRI and the CSO to further a specious argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quinn even mentions that he is married to a non-EU migrant, as if that gives him the moral platform to blame immigration for our housing and infrastructure problems. That's like Donald Trump saying he likes Mexicans but is still going to build a wall to keep them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blaming the small number of immigrants here from impoverished areas and war zones for causing our housing problems and strains on our infrastructure has too many echoes of our shameful 1930s Blueshirt movement. We do not have an extreme ultra-right wing nationalist party and I would like to keep it that way. Gerard McKeown Marino, Dublin 3 Out of control The figures cited raise the possibility that immigrants could outnumber Irish-born people by mid-century. And because we have ceded control over EU migration to our masters in Brussels, there is little we can do about it. Michael Garvey Killester, Dublin 5 Rescue party You mention that Ireland does not have an anti-immigration party. More's the pity. As someone who increasingly feels like a stranger here, I would gladly vote for such a party. Michael Galvin Balgriffin, Co DublinMarchers bring message homeI was in Dublin city centre during the March for Choice (&quot;Repeal the Eighth campaign flares up&quot;, News, last week). While I disagreed with the sentiments expressed by the marchers, I was glad we live in a country where their voices could be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It struck me later, however: what if the mothers of the men and women who took part had made the choice to terminate those marchers' lives before they were born?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those of us who know and love people who were at the march, their absence is difficult to contemplate. Brendan ConroyWindy Arbour, Dublin 14 Different case Gerry Edwards of TFMR accuses David Quinn of &quot;a hurtful misrepresentation of what some 'terminations' of pregnancy really entail&quot; (&quot;Adding to the pain&quot;, Letters, last week). Abortion can't be categorised into good and bad: all abortion is evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edwards surely displays naivety in his belief that &quot;hospitals ensure that a baby born alive is provided with all the palliative end-of-life care available to any baby born with similar conditions at a later gestational stage&quot;. He should consult some of the nurses in the pro-life movement who formerly worked in these hospitals. M Dillon Shanballymore, Co CorkNeed for advice I find it of concern that in the hours of debate about the unborn baby, nobody has thought to ask the state what services it provides for the very fragile but living baby and their families. A mother should be advised on how her frail baby will be cared for in a short life, if she decides on a full-term birth. Jonathan Irwin, Jack and Jill Children's Foundation Count down One pro-choice organiser of the march told the media there were more than 40,000 participants; another stated 30,000. RTE reported that it took 40 minutes for the &quot;tens of thousands of marchers to pass the Spire&quot;. Newspapers, including The Sunday Times, stated there were &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of marchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 40 years I have used the &quot;six steps to head counting&quot; methodology in determining the numbers. Based on this, there were fewer than 20,000. Vincent J Lavery Dalkey, Co Dublin Without doubt Further to Justine McCarthy's piece &quot;Legal certainty is politically suicidal&quot; (Comment, last week), one need look no further for legal certainty than article 40.3.3 of the constitution, which recognises both the mother and her unborn child as human beings - that's the significance of the word &quot;equal&quot;. For the pro-choice constituency, the more general the replacement of that amendment, the better, since it would be open to an endless expansion of abortion entitlements. David ManlyFoxrock Avenue, Dublin 18May snipers are off targetYet more sniping about Theresa May, which serves only to further undermine the British prime minister and with it the Brexit negotiating position (&quot;Theresa May: woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown&quot;, News Review, last week). May received a mandate from the British people at the last election with 42% of the vote, in line with that obtained by Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. Contrast this with Angela Merkel's recent 33% of the vote, down from 41.5%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk of leadership challenges is tiresome, puerile and unhelpful when there is no credible successor to May, who is one of the few politicians capable of uniting Brexiteers and remainers. Diana Sandercock Redditch, Worcestershire Divide and conquer May leads a coalition. On the far right are hard Brexiteers who would be more at home in Ukip, while on the left is a much larger group of One Nation Disraeli-ites who want to water down Brexit so that it will make little economic difference and allow us to rejoin the EU at a future date. The right-wing Tory media briefing against May and the rebellion by Johnson are just symptoms of that division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May was a compromise intended to bridge an unbridgeable divide, and if the Conservatives want to remain in power they are stuck with her. Whoever takes May's place has to be acceptable to MPs on the left of the party; for that reason Johnson does not stand a chance, whatever his right-wing media chums may wish. Martin Bell, by emailPlane dealing As I understand it, a large part of the post-Brexit utopia promised by Johnson and his colleagues is a trade deal with the United States. Is the 219% levy placed on the aircraft maker Bombardier by the Americans, which will hit jobs in Northern Ireland, part of this cunning plan? Dr Charles Gauci,Gozo, Malta Too many sink suds in soapsBrenda Power's piece &quot;Shampoo, set and a nice G&amp;T please&quot; (Comment, last week) reminded me that something has been bugging me about one of my favourite TV soaps, Coronation Street, which has an emphasis on the consumption of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know a lot of soaps are centred on the pub and the amount of alcohol consumed in the Rovers Return would be within normal-ish limits. However, I consider the amount of drunkenness portrayed as excessive and a bad example. Anne Keane, by emailSparkling solution Power, writing tongue-in-cheek, appears to support having a free glass of alcohol at the hairdressers, in preference to a head massage. What next? A trendy wine bar at the rear of the salon, with lots of foreign-sounding names? But what about a sparkling, life-enhancing glass of aqua pura instead, to enjoy with one's favourite daily newspaper?Vera Hughes MoateCo WestmeathPointsTrip was no vacation John Burns's obsession with Sinn Fein was boring and now it seems a little bizarre (&quot;They have gone away, you know - to Barcelona&quot;, Atticus, last week). His latest barb is aimed at four Sinn Fein representatives who went as part of an international delegation to observe the independence referendum in Catalonia. &quot;Dirty job, someone's got to do it,&quot; he writes. I wonder in light of the police and state violence that ensued, does it look such a junket now? Se&aacute;n Mac DomhnaillCastleknock, Dublin 15Flying in circles Is there not a wonderful irony in the fact that Ryanair was brought down to earth by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority for failing to adhere to EU regulations, while at the same time the British government is trying to free the country of such regulations (&quot;Fasten your seatbelts; Ryanair still faces a bumpy ride ahead&quot;, Editorial, last week)? Ian KavanaghKilmainham, Dublin 8Odd alliance Mike McLoughlin claims, for a second time, that neither the IRA's Frank Ryan nor Se&aacute;n Russell were Nazi collaborators (&quot;Different aims&quot;, Letters, last week). But as McLoughlin himself points out, they of their own volition collaborated with the Nazis in 1940 in advising the Nazis' foreign office, acquiring Nazi weaponry for use against the Nazis' main enemy - and travelling in a Nazi U-boat. Tony AllwrightCarrickmines, DublinHealthy opinion It is warming to see what concern Anthony Warner shows for us vegans and the neurological damage we might suffer (&quot;The angry chef: the dangers of a vegan diet&quot;, Magazine, last week). However, he fails to mention the 56bn animals per year for whom human meat-eating is fatal. The claim that vegans feel superior is absurd. Our defining belief is that we do not feel superior or more virtuous than any of our fellow animals - that is why we don't eat them.

There is a simpler way to check if a bed is safe to inhabit (or is already inhabited) that I call the &quot;scuttle test&quot;. On entering your hotel room, put all the lights on and fling the covers and sheets back. If anything scuttles out of the light, do not get in the bed. Simples. Peter CollinsSandhurst, BerkshireHiggins high point Justine McCarthy suggested that we might have witnessed the zenith of the Michael D Higgins presidency (&quot;Higgins must put his trust in us again&quot;, Comment, September 24). I suspect she may be right. The president strikes me as a man who has fought many battles with his conscience. He was about to win one in relation to serving a second term, but this time he might have been rumbled. In any event, the head of government should also be the head of state as they mostly are, except in (for the most part) European countries where the people had to take power off monarchs, who still held on to their perks.

Instead, Stephen Paddock was white and &quot;one of their own&quot;. What will Trump do now? Tell folks this is not the time to bring politics into the discussion and tweet about something different to get the &quot;fake news people&quot; off his back, I expect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Office ministers have tried to deflect cross-party anger as it emerged that not a single extra lone child refugee has been brought to Britain from Europe under the &quot;Dubs amendment&quot; this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration minister, Brandon Lewis, met accusations that the government was &quot;dragging its feet&quot; by disclosing he will visit Italy and Greece next week to follow up the invitation to refer eligible children to be brought to Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But during an urgent Commons question raised by the outgoing Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, he faced cross-party criticism that it was taking too long to process eligible refugee children in Europe to bring them to Britain.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Office ministers have confirmed in written answers that only 200 children were transferred under Dubs in 2016 in after the closure of the Calais camp and 280 local authority places remain to be filled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dubs amendment, known as section 67, was passed in April 2016 amid a campaign to bring 3,000 lone refugee children stuck in camps in Europe to Britain. Ministers initially estimated local authority capacity at 350 but extended it to 480 in April after saying there had been &quot;an administrative error&quot; in the initial figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lily Caprani, of Unicef UK, said: &quot;It's unacceptable that we have seen no children brought under the Dubs scheme this year. As a nation we showed our compassion and our principles when we helped refugee children stranded in Calais, but we were told this was not the end of the story. We are seeing too many children still having to make dangerous journeys to reach safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Commons, Farron said it was hard to see the government's response as anything more than lip service and demanded to know when the &quot;measly commitment&quot; of 480 would be met. &quot;I have visited the camps in Greece and elsewhere - something neither the home secretary nor the prime minister have done. I have met these children who, through no fault of their own, find their lives paused as ministers have chosen to ignore them,&quot; said the Lib Dem leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Has the UK government even signed a memorandum of understanding with Greece to get these transfers under way? I know of two young people who signed a consent form to be transferred under Dubs over a year ago. They are still stuck in Greece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  UK to take 130 more lone refugee children in Dubs scheme climbdown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His frustration was echoed by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, and former Labour cabinet minster Yvette Cooper. Abbott demanded to know how many children would be transferred under Dubs in 2017/18. Cooper accused ministers of &quot;dragging their feet&quot; and said it was &quot;shameful&quot; that their only response had been to send a few officials. &quot;Get on with the job,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration minister said he had spoken to officials in Greece and Italy in the past week in an attempt to speed up the process and would go in person next week to follow up. &quot;But the transfers must take place in line with the national laws, they must take place safely and they must be in the best interests of each child,&quot; he told MPs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He underlined that Britain's policy of giving shelter to refugees from those in the region closest to Syria meant that 20,000 refugees from outside Europe would be brought to the UK by 2020.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by government-affiliated Greek news agency ANA-MPA website on 2 November</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[&quot;Mayors of Aegean Islands Plead for Help To Tackle Overcrowding, Slow Processing of Refugees&quot;]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayors of four Aegean islands briefed a parliamentary committee on Thursday [2 November] on the situation in Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Kos, and Leros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesvos mayor Spyros Galinos told the permanent committee on public administration, public order and justice that local societies were overcome by the migration issue and felt abandoned. &quot;We threw ourselves into the sea to save people and have come to the point of being criticized as racists,&quot; he said, in a problem that he noted is not local but Greek and European.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven villages are in a continuous crisis&quot; on Chios, mayor Manolis Vournous said, &quot;with migrants coming and going in their fields and hothouses for food, some of them entering homes as well.&quot; Although this was an exception rather than the rule, he said, it influenced the attitude of locals. He also charged that the agreement between the European Union and Turkey to stem the flow of refugees &quot;is implemented only by half, because the return (of migrants) to Turkey is not being carried out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The islands don't need money, they need political will and infrastructure as well as personnel, Samos mayor Michalis Angelopoulos said. The staff reviewing refugee applications, he said, consists of three people who can only process a total of eight applications a day, resulting in 14-month delays for refugees. The islands of the Northeast Aegean must not become the only solution to the issue, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kos mayor Giorgos Kyritsis criticized the use of the islands as &quot;an easy solution for some&quot;, and said that the majority of migrants on his island &quot;are neither refugees, nor do they have the profile of a refugee; their own countries will not take them back.&quot; He proposed that they be returned to Turkey, as foreseen in the EU agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michail Kolias, mayor of Leros, said the islanders lived under a state of insecurity because there was no clear answer to whether a new hotspot would be created on the island, which he opposed. He also called for additional staff for the local hospital, which could hardly serve locals as is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayors spoke of the feelings of despair by islanders and migrants alike, the sense that there was no political will to move towards a solution, and the fear that the islands would serve as places of entrapment for migrants who would not be able to move on. They also spoke of atrocious conditions at the hotspots, some barely fulfilling humanitarian requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his response, Migration Policy Minister Yiannis Mouzalas said that the islands needed relief on many fronts, and pointed out that the EU agreement reduced migration flow by 97%, but more returns to Turkey should be carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister also said that conditions at the hotspot of Moria on Lesvos were barely adequate, and said the solution was a strategy of decompressing the camps by expanding them and improving conditions, creating pre-repatriation centres, and increasing staff in migration agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The island mayors had met in March with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, through an initiative by Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, to discuss the issues the islands had to confront during two years of heavy refugee flows.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Hussin Ahmed's children, aged between 8 months and 17 years, wake from their nightmares in Kutupalong refugee camp they cry out, &quot;The soldiers are coming&quot;. As Mr Ahmed and his family fled their burning village in Burma's Rakhine state, they saw other Rohingya villagers being shot dead by Burmese soldiers. Kutupalong is the world's largest refugee camp, and 60 per cent of its population are children. They arrive deeply traumatised, having witnessed systematic violence inflicted on their friends and families by the Burmese state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Satellite photographs show that the burning of villages in Rakhine state has continued even after official repatriation plans have been agreed by the governments of Burma and Bangladesh. Understandably, few Rohingya refugees are willing to return. There are no homes left for them to return to, and there is every likelihood that the expulsions will restart when the world turns its attention elsewhere. Thousands continue to arrive in camps like Kutupalong every day. The breakneck pace of the Burmese army's campaign of arson, rape and murder has left the usual aid infrastructure overwhelmed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times' Christmas Appeal is supporting an experienced charity, Children on the Edge, which recognises that the education and protection of children is the most urgent need in Kutupalong. Set up by the late Dame Anita Roddick, the charity has been working with Rohingya Muslims in Bangladesh since 2010, before most of the world was aware of their plight. As well as responding to the immediate relief needs of hundreds of new arrivals, it is making plans to continue its provision of services once the plight of the Rohingya recedes from the international spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children on the Edge is mobilising partners in the field to expand the provision of basic services. The charity intends to set up 100 additional learning centres in the Kutupalong camp, educating 10,000 refugees. These centres will be safe spaces where children can play, talk and begin to come to terms with the horrors they have seen. Early intervention is vital for deeply traumatised children, but so is continued support. John Littleton, the charity's Asia manager, explained that &quot;to give these people the help they need, we have to commit to the long term&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well-meant mistakes made by others in the early days of the crisis risk threatening the camp's future. In the scramble to keep up with the surge of refugees since August, aid workers dug thousands of latrines and tube wells. Most of them were too shallow, increasing the risk of cholera, diphtheria and other potentially fatal outbreaks. Children on the Edge is at work drilling deeper, safer 600ft wells, and hopes to use the money donated by Times readers to install biogas latrines, which hygienically power cooking stoves with the gas produced by human waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This and other aid efforts in the area are dependent on the continuing support of the Bangladeshi government. At the moment, aid agencies are allowed to build shelters only with vulnerable materials such as bamboo. The government fears that allowing the use of sturdier building materials will mean that camps such as Kutupalong are seen as permanent, reducing the pressure on Burma and other actors to move the Rohingya elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments across the world should respond by offering support to what is already one of the world's poorest nations. The international community needs to put more pressure on the Burmese government to identify and sanction those responsible for the atrocities. In the meantime the humanitarian goal is to support those who have managed to escape, especially the most vulnerable. Children on the Edge understands the scope of the problem. It is a deserving charity on the front line of tragedy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. David Gordon Green, 119 mins, starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Tatiana Maslany, Miranda Richardson, Richard Lane Jr, Nate Richman, Lenny Clarke</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boston Strong&quot; was the defiant motto the American city came up with after the bombing of the Boston marathon in 2013. The slogan is heard several times in David Gordon Green's rousing drama based on the true story of Jeff Bauman, one of the victims of the blast, who lost both his legs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film is less about the bombing itself (that story was told in last year's </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patriots Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">) than about the indomitable will of blue-collar, working-class Bostonians. Jeff Bauman is the everyman who (eventually) becomes a symbol for all that is best about Boston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stronger </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is also a love story. What it isn't is remotely pretty or escapist. Director Green wants to rub our noses in the squalor and the suffering that Jeff endures after his double above the knee amputation. We see him writhing on the floor after falling off the loo seat, or stuck in the bath, or trying to pull himself across the asphalt of a car park after a row with his girlfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarkably versatile Jake Gyllenhaal gives another outstanding performance as Jeff. Gyllenhaal has played his share of oddballs (</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nightcrawler</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">), neurotics (</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nocturnal Animals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">), romantic leads in cowboy films (</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brokeback Mountain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">) and dashing heroes (</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince Of Persia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, he's a likeable but feckless ordinary Joe who has a job in the food warehouse of his local Costco. When he goes out on dates, he'll often still have chicken legs in his hair. Jeff likes to drink beer in his lucky seat in the bar, watching his beloved Boston Red Sox. He still hasn't left home or really grown up at all. He's a charming but infuriating slacker whose main characteristic in the eyes of his ex-girlfriend Erin (Tatiana Maslany) is that he's late for everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff wants to get back together with Erin, which is why, in spite of waking up late, he hauls himself off to the finishing line of the Boston Marathon to wait for her as she finishes the race.On the one day Jeff turns up on time, a bomb is let off beside him. &quot;Your fucking legs, they're gone bro,&quot; Jeff wakes up in the hospital to be told by a relative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know how </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stronger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is going to unfold. This is yet another story of American heroism and resilience in the face of terrible odds. Green, thankfully, avoids most of the glutinous sentimentality which generally comes with such a story. Instead, he takes a gritty, naturalistic approach to the subject matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, as the camera roams around the hospital waiting room where all Jeff's relatives are bickering and swearing, the film takes on the quality of a fly-on-the-wall documentary. In one sequence, held for a very long time, the camera remains trained on Jeff's face as he endures the agony of having his bandages ripped off from the stumps of what were his legs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green is always ready to address the everyday problems that Jeff now faces. How does he get in and out of a car? How do his family get his wheelchair up a flight of stairs with him sitting in it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff isn't always admirable or courageous; he'sprey to extreme self-pity. It's not as if he was used to doing things for himself anyway. Even before the bomb blasted away his legs, he was doted on by his blowsy, outspoken, hard-drinking mother Patty (a vivid performance from Miranda Richardson.) Now, he has to rely even more on others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erin's rekindled romance with him isn't always straightforward either. There are hints she is staying with him partly through guilt. It was because of her that he was at the Boston Marathon in the first place. &quot;He's fucking wasted and covered in his own shit and I have to clean him,&quot; she yells in exasperation at her role as his nursemaid as well as his lover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From time to time, Jeff endures flashbacks to the chaotic moments after the bomb went off, when he was photographed being taken to the ambulance. That picture made him a celebrity. Everyone wanted to know what had become of him. He was invited to wave the flag at sports events. Even Oprah Winfrey asked for an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His pre-ordained role was that of the plucky survivor, showing resilience and good humour in the face of his own suffering. It wasn't a role Jeff always wanted to play. The filmmakers continually contrast Jeff's public image as the face of &quot;Boston strong&quot; with the much more complicated reality of his domestic life as he struggles to adjust to his condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the film endorses the public view of Jeff as an all-American hero. The emphasis slowly shifts as Jeff accepts the way the outside world sees him and as he realises that he is helping other overcome suffering in their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's at this point the film risks becoming trite. Everybody comes together. Jeff tells his bickering family that he wouldn't swap them for the world. The entire city suddenly seems united. The traumatised man in the photograph taken in the immediate aftermath of the bombing valiantly puts his life back together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, it was never that simple. There is something glib about the way the film delivers its inevitable upbeat ending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stronger </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is at its best in its harshest moments, when it acknowledges the contradictions in its hero's story and portrays his bitterness and self-loathingas well as his courage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow (12A)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">****<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#9734;</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. Ai Weiwei, 140 mins, featuring: Ai Weiwei</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei's magnificent documentary stands as a companion piece to the BBC's series, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exodus: Our Journey To Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Both projects are epic in scale, often heartbreaking to watch, and both put the current refugee crisis in a historical and political context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exodus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the refugees told their stories from the inside, with cameras given them by the producers. In </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Ai Weiwei is the godlike figure, looking into the refugees' worlds from the outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One astonishing shot sums up the Chinese artist's approach in a nutshell. We see from very high up what appears to be some abstract shapes far, far below us. The camera descends and we think it is showing us an ant colony as we see tiny mites moving in the distance. The camera continues to head downward and eventually, at ground level, plunges us into the middle of a seething, bustling refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no voice-over here. Instead, intertitles will appear on screen quoting poetry and philosophical reflections on the plight of refugees; headlines from newspaper articles will be shown discreetly. There are also several interviews with politicians and NGO representatives as well as many interviews with refugees themselves, often with their backs to camera. T</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he constant use of drone-operated cameras enables Ai Weiwei to show scenes of thousands of people at once, walking or on boats or packed into camps. At the same time, the film is very intimate. The Chinese artist is pictured again and again interacting with the refugees, cutting people's hair, cooking or mingling in crowds everywhere from the &quot;Jungle&quot; near Calais to Lebanon, Macedonia, the isle of Lesbos and the indoor camp in the hangars atBerlin's Tempelhof Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 20 crews worked on </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which was shot in 23 countries. The documentary could easily have seemed disjointed in the extreme, but it is edited gracefully and is easy, if frequently shocking, to watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei is never overtly polemical. He is interested in the human stories, not in unpicking the root causes of the feuds and injustices that have led to so many millions being displaced from their homes. The majority of the refugees he shows are Muslims. He doesn't ask why this is the case. Nor does he try to make glib connections between refugees in different parts of the world. The implicit point is that they all suffer in the same way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, there is a deliberate ambiguity. One of the most striking sequences is of a tiger imprisoned in Gaza. We hear that this beautiful animal strayed into the Palestinian camp through one of the tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt. The image of the tiger confined in a tiny space so far from its natural home has an obvious metaphorical power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Ai Weiwei is letting us know that animals are treated better than human refugees. To get the tiger to safety in South Africa, different governments signed forms and overcame considerable bureaucratic hurdles. No-one pays this level of attention or care to the human refugees, who are ignored and marginalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film captures the surrealistic and cruelly absurdist quality of the refugees' everyday experiences. One mother talks about wandering with her child for 60 days in no particular direction, with no-one to tell her where to go. We see 13,000 refugees in a disused railway station in Macedonia as torrential rain pours down on them. They have no way of keeping dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei is fascinated by a tiny gateway into western Europe through which apparently more than a million people have passed. There are scenes of Afghans who've lived for generations in Pakistan, packing all their possessions onto very unsteady looking trucks and heading home, which in their case means taking a huge leap into the unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, the landscapes or maritime scenes are incongruously beautiful. Out of an idyllic looking moonlit sea will suddenly appear a dinghy overcrowded with desperate refugees in life jackets.Individual scenes, whether of a cow walking down the middle of a street as if it owns it or of a horse being trained in the middle of a garbage-strewn city square, have an unlikely lyricism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever he goes, Ai Weiwei always pays attention to the kids, showing them playing or getting up to mischief, seemingly oblivious to the squalor of their surroundings, or trying to make sense of the captivity in which they are forced to live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a logistical level alone, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an astonishing piece of work. It is very different from TV reportage on the same subject. Ai Weiwei is offering a panoramic view of the world of the refugees. He treats these refugees with dignity and kindness, insisting on seeing every one of them as an individual with a story to tell, rather than as a part of some abstract mass of suffering humanity that those in more fortunate circumstances would far prefer to ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dinner (15)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">**<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. Oren Moverman, 120 mins, starring: Richard Gere, Steve Coogan, Laura Linney, Rebecca Hall,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutch writer Herman Koch's controversial 2009 novel </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Het Diner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dinner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">) was a huge bestseller in the Netherlands and internationally. The book tells of two bourgeois couples (brothers Paul and Stan and their wives) who meet in an upmarket restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the meal progresses, after the usual small talk it becomes apparent that an act of extreme violence by their teenage sons threatens to tear their seemingly contented and privileged lives apart. The book has already inspired two other films versions in Dutch and Italian -and now it has been made as an English-language movie by Oren Moverman, with a big-name cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turns out to be a very sour affair.The charisma of the two leads, Richard Gere and Steve Coogan, can't hide the unpleasantness of the characters they are playing. Gere is Stan, a narcissistic and very shallow politician who is running for governor. He can barely stay at the table for a moment without being distracted by a call he has to take or some business matter, and is used to everybody doing his bidding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogan is an embittered and misanthropic academic, jealous and resentful of his brother. He brings anger and intensity to the role but hardly a touch of the humour you expect as soon as you see him on screen. The wives (Rebecca Hall and Laura Linney) are as miserable as their husbands.The teenage sons aren't any more pleasant, especially when they're setting fire to a hobo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moverman (screenwriter of such films as </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm Not There</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Love And Mercy,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and also director of the excellent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time Out Of Mind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">) probes away in forensic fashion at the tensions between the brothers. The film also asks how far the characters will go to protect their families, and what responsibilities they're prepared to take for their children's actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can see the points Moverman is trying to make, but it's just a pity that the dialogue isn't sharper and that the protagonists are so thoroughly unsympathetic. &quot;I just don't want to be with these people,&quot; Coogan's character complains early on. We know exactly how he feels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigsby Bear (15)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#9734;&#9734;</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. Dave McCary, 97 mins, starring: Kyle Mooney, Mark Hamill, Jane Adams, Greg Kinnear, Matt Walsh, Michaela Watkins, Ryan Simpkins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigsby Bear</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continually confounds audience expectations. In spite of the title, this is no cuddly kids' movie -but it does feature a giant teddy along with large helpings of whimsical and sometimes juvenile humour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, it plays like a version of Werner Herzog's </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Enigma Of Kaspar Hauser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, re-imagined for a social media generation. It is ingratiating and creepy by turns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The holy innocent is James (played by comedian and co-writer, Kyle Mooney), a young man first encountered living in an underground bunker somewhere in the desert. He is not allowed to go outside because he has been told by his &quot;parents&quot; Ted and April that the air is toxic. (They wear gas masks if they leave the bunker.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James spends his days watching videos of a show called </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigsby Bear</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and then communicating with fellow Brigsby enthusiasts on a &quot;Brisgby fan forum&quot;. It's a bizarre show which plays like a clunky children's sci-fi drama, but also contains New Age elements and instructions in advanced level mathematics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We learn quickly that James is actually a kidnap victim, taken as a baby by Ted and Aprilwho aren't his real parents at all. When James is sprung from captivity and reunited with his real parents, he can't help but yearn to be back undergroundwatching Brigsby videos. His real parents don't seem to &quot;get&quot; him at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ted is played in incongruously cheery and avuncular fashion by Mark Hamill. If he is a child snatcher and a bully, he's a very goodnatured one. The other characters in the film don't behave as expected either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James is a curious mix of resourcefulness and naivety. He learns to his utter dismay that Brigsby isn't real and that Ted and April made the videos themselves, and constructed the fans' forum. He also discovers that he can make movies himself, bring the bear back to life and create a story in which Brigsby finally defeats his arch-enemy, the Sunchaser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Brigsby never gives up &quot;even when everything is against him&quot;, James is heroically persistent in his efforts to bring Brigsby back to the screen. It helps that he has the assistance of the detective (Greg Kinnear) who &quot;rescued&quot; him and who turns out to be a stagestruck, would-be actor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tone here oscillates wildly. One moment, it's as if we are watching a family outdoors adventure. The next, James is being arrested as a terrorist for staging a spectacular explosion during filming for Brigsby. There is a satirical element to the film too as it depicts Brigsby becoming an online sensation and everyone assuming that the series is being made in ironic and tongue-in-cheek fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the odds, Brigsby never descends into cynicism. The film-within-the-film that James, his family and friends makes about the bear is unexpectedly charming, with Melies-like special effects and a beguiling innocence to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James, the seemingly autistic and emotionally stunted hero, has the ability to touch people and to understand them in a way that his frosty psychotherapist (Claire Danes) does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is something refreshing about the carefree way the filmmakers here ignore genre rules and develop their story in such eccentric and offbeat fashion. What is not clear, though, is at whom the movie is aimed. Kids will find it quirky and baffling while fans of broader comedies may be put off by its more bizarre elements. It's stuck in some no-man's land between the arthouse and the mainstream, between children's drama and adult-oriented comedy. That's bad news for the bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menashe (U)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">****<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#9734;</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. Joshua Z Weinstein, 82 mins, starring: Menashe Lustig, Yoel Falkowitz</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menashe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a rough gem of a film, a small-scale but delicately observed and quietly funny Yiddish-language drama, about the tribulations of a Hasidic Jewish widower in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The endlessly beleaguered protagonist Menashe just can't get his schtick together. He has a young son to whom he is devoted but there is a very real danger he won't be allowed to keep the boy. Hasidic tradition demands the boy should have a mother and a stable family -and that's what Menashe can't provide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film is reportedly inspired by the real life of its Hasidic star, Menashe Lustig. He gives a wonderful performance as the well-intentioned but bumbling and chaotic father. Menashe has a job that he does very badly in a local food store. He is in debt to his boss. The elders and his own relatives are critical of everything from how he dresses to his unorthodox behaviour. He is given a deadline to find himself a new wife and to pay off his debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Joshua Z Weinstein extracts plenty of humour from Menashe's misfortunes. Everything the poor schmuck tries to do turns out wrong. He can't even deliver a consignment of fish without catastrophe striking. When he approaches the community's matchmaker and arranges a date with a recently widowed woman, the result is predictably disastrous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menashe is determined to prove himself a mensch by organising a memorial tribute to his late wife, but he can't cook and he lives in a tiny apartment. He can barely raise a chicken, let alone a child. At the same time, he is a devoted father to his son Rieven. In his own erratic way, he is sweet-natured and even quite resourceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film works both as a documentary-like inside view of life in New York's close-knit, tradition-bound Hasidic community and as a stirring tale of a father who will go to almost any lengths to keep his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever pickle he gets himself in, we can't help but root for Menashe. We witnesshis humiliations in the presence of his peers but see many examples of his kindness and his attempts to do the best by his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better Watch Out (15)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. Chris Peckover, 89 mins, starring: Dacre Montgomery, Olivia DeJonge, Virginia Madsen, Patrick Warburton, Levi Miller, Ed Oxenbould</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its cynicism, violence and black humour, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better Watch Out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an antidote to the typical Christmas movie - but it is an exploitative, silly and thoroughly unpleasant affair, with a premise that defies credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film is billed as &quot;'Home Alone' meets 'Scream</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; and is also clearly an attempt to emulate the much slicker youth-oriented horror movies made by Jason Blum. Levi Miller plays the demonic12-year-old anti-hero Luke, who wants to get it on with his babysitter but ends up terrorising her instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film completely fails to explain how or why politely spoken, slightly nerdy little Luke has turned into an adolescent psychopath or why noone has noticed before quite what a scumbag he actually is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashley (Olivia DeJonge), the babysitter, is about to leave town for a new life in Pittsburgh. It's the festive season and she is looking after little Luke while his parents go out to a party. No sooner have they left the house than the shock tactics begin. There are spiders to scare her, bricks through the window, prowlers in the grounds, a masked invader, and trip wires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the grimmest moments, carols or Christmas music will blast away on the soundtrack. The film, though set in the US, is Australian-made -and one or two of the young actors have an Aussie twang in their voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on, the film appears to be tongue in cheek. We are told that when you are frightened, your body releases the same dopamine as when you are aroused -one reason why horror movies are sometimes so pleasurable to watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best scenes are those involving the parents -the sarcastic, acidic tongued mother (Virginia Madsen) and her browbeaten husband (Patrick Warburton) in his ridiculous Christmas tie. The parents, though, are only on screen for a few minutes. After that, we're left in the hands of the Tom Ripley-like Luke and his best friend, Garrett (Ed Oxenbould.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts at giving the film a comic dimension are undermined by the sheer viciousness with which Luke behaves. Smashing a snowman with a baseball bat is one thing, but it's quite another to show the same malicious glee when hitting one of Ashley's ex-boyfriends in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The filmmakers come up with some striking imagery for example, the blood of one victim mingling with yellow paint in a colourful gouache, or a gruesome but cleverly staged scene of a hanging. Overall, though, this is grim and repellent fare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER boiling 6,400 litres of water, using 825kg of sugar, and spending &pound;3,500 of fundraised money, two girls have served 76,800 cups of tea to refugees living in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosie Johnson, 22 from Wiveliscombe, and Lily Stephenson, from Plymouth, left at the end of February on a mission to show support to people living in challenging conditions in refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called themselves SolidariTea, serving cups of tea from a van, built by their friends Harriet and Conrad, to refugees in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair had already spent four months at a refugee camp on Greek island Chios, until one stormy day left them feeling like they wanted to give more.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tea truck in action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community in Wiveliscombe rallied around the girls to support their cause, raising around &pound;10,000 for them to carry out their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five months later, they've returned from their travels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They served tea twice a day, at 10am and 3pm, and didn't have a day off for the first 10 weeks they were there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their time on the tea truck, the pair met all kinds of people that had come to the barracks in an attempt to find safety, but they watched that safety get stripped away from the desperate refugees as their temporary home got destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lily Stephenson packing the supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lily said: &quot;We had no idea what the trip would be like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought we'd be making our way to Greece, serving tea along the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But when we got to Serbia, we thought oh my god, we can't leave. So we stayed in Serbia for five months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosie said: &quot;We arrived in Belgrade on a sleeper train. We arrived and thought 'what have we got ourselves into'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The one image that will stick in our minds when we arrived is driving past the barracks and seeing 'HELP ME' written in big red writing on the walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were derelict buildings everywhere and men wrapped in blankets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the most concerning things they learnt were the stories of the children in the barracks that had made it there alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From children who were forced by their parents to be smugglers of drugs and people, to children that fled their countries after watching their family members be slaughtered by the Taliban. They saw children as young as ten all on their own, in need of some stability and comfort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lily said: &quot;People were bored in the barracks, there was nothing to do for any stimulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of aims was to create a sense of community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the boys were as young as ten, one their own, isolated, living in an adult word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tried to give them some structure, routine, and a bit of positivity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few months in, the barracks were destroyed, displacing around 1,000 men and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had heard rumours of an eviction for a while. The authorities wanted it out of view from the tourists,&quot; Rosie added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the eviction, dangerous chemicals were sprayed across the barracks, they said it was to clean the area, but we thought it was to get people out before the eviction date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People had no information, they had no idea what to do, they feared that if they went to another camp then they would be evicted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lily said: &quot;There was a feeling of mass-panic in the days running up to the eviction, but we decided to just keep serving tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt like the musicians playing music on the Titanic as it was sinking, we just kept going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could feel that bad things were coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The authorities stormed into the camps, waking people up aggressive with tent poles, pushing them out of the barracks before they had time to grab the few belongings they still had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They watched as their new friends were shipped off to unknown futures, and then the bulldozers came in to demolish the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the upheaval, the pair wondered where to go next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They'd lost track of some of their friends, and others were at one of the 16 refugee camps in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They didn't want to become part of the &quot;oppressive&quot; world of the refugee camps, so they answered a call for help from another volunteer group Aid Delivery Mission, and made their way to a town close to the Bulgaria border called Sid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sid, SolidariTea expanded into serving breakfast to the groups of men and children hiding in the forests near to the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their five weeks there they boiled 1,750 litres of water for tea, boiled 9,525 eggs, distributed 11,500 pieces of fruit, and gave out 150kg of sunflower seeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While they were there, they said they were constantly discouraged by the local police for feeding the refugees, but they didn't let that phase them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lily said: &quot;We had heard stories of groups being shut down by the police so we weren't sure if we could be SolidariTea there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The authorities tried everything to try and stop us. On the day of the Manchester terror attack, one police officer asked me 'aren't you afraid of these refugees? These are the people that did the terror attacks' and I replied 'you don't know anything do you? These people are try to escape the same thing'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tried to appear like we weren't afraid of the police, but we were. We were always looking over our shoulders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They got to know a new group of desperate people trying to get to safety. They learnt stories of 'the game', a term given to the attempt to cross the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girls collected testimonies from the men that returned for their failed venture to cross the border, some coming back beaten, bitten by dogs, and shoeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They heard one horrific story from a young man named Mohamed, who planned to play 'the game' by jumping on the back of a speeding train with two of his friends, in the hopes it would get them across the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Mohamed's friends fell off the train and was decapitated. Terrified, Mohamed himself fell off and lost a foot. The third managed to escape into the forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They asked 10-year-old Assad, who was attempting 'the game' every night, if he was afraid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosie Johnson with a boy refugee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosie said: &quot;When I was 10, my mum wouldn't even let me walk to school on my own, let alone get into a container to Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We asked him if he was scared, and he said he wasn't, and that he had to try again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His childhood has been lost to this world of adults and border-crossings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last night they distributed food was Eid, the end of Ramadan, before heading back to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But plans are already afoot to head to back out at some point to continue their mission of providing tea and support, after some rest and more valuable fundraising..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lily added: &quot;Coming back to England was personally hard. We've had to make some adjustments. We've realised how privileged we are to live in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We aren't sure if we should be happy to be back or sad they're still there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's overwhelming to think of all those people still at the border, all with their own stories, that will probably never be heard.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis demanded Thursday that the international community take &quot;decisive measures&quot; to resolve the causes of the mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, breaking his recent silence over what the United Nations has declared to be a textbook case of &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving in Bangladesh from Myanmar, Francis said it also was &quot;imperative&quot; for world governments to immediately provide assistance to help the Bangladeshi government cope with Asia's worst refugee crisis in decades.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech before Bangladesh President President Abdul Hamid, government officials and ambassadors from around the world, Francis praised Bangladesh's sacrifice and generosity in welcoming in so many refugees &quot;before the eyes of the whole world.&quot; He didn't identify the Rohingya by name, ethnicity or faith, referring only to &quot;refugees from Rakhine state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his words were sharp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of us can fail to be aware of the gravity of the situation, the immense toll of human suffering involved, and the precarious living conditions of so many of our brothers and sisters, a majority of whom are women and children, crowded in the refugee camps,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis fails to mention Rohingya crisis in key Burma speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis told 'no religious discrimination' in Burma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope condemns politicians who spread racism over migration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis visits Burma in shadow of Rohingya refugee crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is imperative that the international community take decisive measures to address this grave crisis, not only by working to resolve the political issues that have led to the mass displacement of people, but also by offering immediate material assistance to Bangladesh in its effort to respond effectively to urgent human needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis, a tireless and fearless advocate for refugees, outcasts and society's most marginal, had drawn criticism from human rights organizations and Rohingya themselves for having failed to speak out publicly about the Rohingya's plight while he was in Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis had remained silent out of diplomatic deference to his hosts, who consider the Rohingya as having illegally migrated from Bangladesh and don't recognize them as one of Myanmar's ethnic groups. More than 620,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar and poured into Bangladesh refugee camps over the last few months amid a scorched earth campaign by Myanmar's military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vatican defended Francis' silence in Myanmar, saying he wanted to &quot;build bridges&quot; with the predominantly Buddhist nation, which only recently established diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Spokesman Greg Burke said Francis took seriously the advice given to him by the local Catholic Church, which urged him to toe a cautious line and not even refer to the Rohingya by name. And he denied the pope would lose his moral authority as a refugee advocate for his silence, saying his public diplomacy didn't negate what he had said previously or what he was saying to Myanmar officials in private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya have faced persecution and discrimination in Myanmar for decades and are denied citizenship, even though many families have lived there for generations. Their plight worsened dramatically in August, when the army began what it called clearance operations in Rakhine state following attacks on security positions by a group of Rohingya militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya who are living in camps in Bangladesh have described indiscriminate attacks by Myanmar security forces and Buddhist mobs, including killings, rapes and the torching of entire villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamid, the Bangladesh president, accused Myanmar's military of having committed &quot;ruthless atrocities&quot; against the Muslims and, in his speech to Francis, demanded international help to return them safely to Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our people welcomed them with open arms, sharing food, shelter and other basic needs,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, it is our shared responsibility to ensure for them a safe, sustainable and dignified return to their own home and integration with the social, economic and political life of Myanmar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya crisis loomed large over Francis' arrival in Dhaka, where huge banners with pictures of the pope and Hamid dotted billboards around town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security was tight and was of a particular concern after a Christian priest went missing in northern Bangladesh on Tuesday, and his family reported they received calls demanding money. Police said they were looking for the man but would not confirm if they believed he had been kidnapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's leading English-language newspaper, The Daily Star, said in an editorial it felt &quot;slightly let down&quot; that the pope didn't mention the Rohingya crisis specifically while in Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We remain hopeful that given Pope Francis' legacy of standing up for the oppressed, he will speak out against the ongoing persecution of the Rohingya during this very important visit,&quot; the paper added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis won't visit the refugee camps while in Bangladesh but will host an interfaith peace meeting on Friday in the garden of the Dhaka archbishops' residence at which a small group of Rohingya is expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis' first events Thursday in Muslim-majority Bangladesh were pure protocol: He visited the national martyrs' memorial and signed a visitors' book at the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum, located at the site where Bangladesh's independence leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and 31 members of his family were killed in a 1975 military coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis then called on Hamid at the presidential palace, where he was led into the conference hall full of officials by toddlers and was given a miniature golden rickshaw as a gift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Francis ordains 16 new Bangladeshi priests in a Dhaka park, an unusual feature of a papal trip and evidence of what Francis upon arrival described as the freedom that the Catholic Church enjoys in Bangladesh to run its many schools and hospitals - a freedom that has brought three popes here, starting with Pope Paul VI in 1970, when it was East Bangladesh, and St. John Paul II in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highlight of the day comes Friday afternoon with the interfaith peace prayer. Francis leaves on Saturday, after meeting with his priests, stopping in at the home where Mother Teresa used to stay when she visited Bangladesh, and hosting about 7,000 young people at a youth rally.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the shadow of what was once the notorious Calais Jungle thousands of refugees have become living targets for smugglers and human traffickers as their plight becomes increasingly perilous. A year on from the demolition of the shantytown, dozens of displaced families are sleeping rough in woodland in the region waiting for their chance to be smuggled into Britain by criminals - often after paying extortionate amounts to guarantee their passage across the Channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of lone teenagers who don't have the means to pay are meanwhile increasingly prone to exploitation at the hands of these gangs, who are promising them a free crossing in return for &quot;work&quot; upon arrival in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees' desperation is exacerbated by the looming winter coupled with the dearth of any form of state or official aid. Since the UK Home Office ended funding for an anti-trafficking service in the region in April 2017, there has been no state agency tackling the problem, leaving the market &quot;open&quot; to criminals who wish to exploit refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official figures indicate the number of gangs targeting the refugees in the area since the Jungle was demolished has increased, with 20 smuggling networks having been dismantled by French police since the start of the year - matching the figure for the whole of 2016. There were just over 8,000 refugees living in the Jungle before it was destroyed, and more than 10,000 at its peak. Following its closure people were transported away from the region to reception centres across France, but in the last 12 months the numbers have been slowly rising again. Between 1,500 and 2,000 refugees are currently sleeping rough in Calais and Dunkirk, according to charities on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ari, a Kurdish Iraqi in his late thirties, fled religious persecution in Iraq with his wife and three young children in January after an attack by a terrorist group left his arm permanently damaged. They arrived in France in August after an eight-month journey through Turkey and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting with his 11-month-old son on a patch of grass in Dunkirk, the former meat trader explained that he has paid &pound;15,000 to a smuggler to get his family to the UK, where he says they hope to join his aunt and cousins - the only relatives they have outside Iraq. Now he carries his phone at all times in case the smuggler calls, having identified a sleeping driver in a lorry, at which point Ari will take his family immediately to the location and make the dangerous attempt to board the vehicle without being heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He says, 'come, come now', and I get my family up and we all get in,&quot; Ari explained. &quot;We've tried many times but no luck. After one or two hours the driver wakes up. I'm hoping it will work eventually, because we have no other choice. Of course this is dangerous for my children, but I don't have any solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several miles east in Calais, hundreds of teenagers and young people meander in a small field close to the now inaccessible land where the Jungle used to be. Late at night, they go to nearby parking lots to try to board lorries. But with smuggling gangs &quot;controlling&quot; many of these areas, they are exposed to increasing danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rishal, 28 and one of the eldest of around 20 women and girls in the area, says her family has paid &pound;10,000 to smugglers so far for her crossing from Eritrea to join her younger brother in Cardiff. She explains that now the money has run out, and she is trying to cross to the UK unassisted. &quot;I try often in the night, sometimes early in the morning. We try to get into lorries. Spending six hours in a truck is hard, and then you get out and you aren't in England.&quot; She rubs the back of her neck, explaining that it is painful from the last attempt she made four days ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eritrean woman didn't explicitly state the risk of traffickers, but she expresses her fear of Kurdish and Afghan men who often guard the lorry parking areas. &quot;They are dangerous,&quot; she said. &quot;They have knives. I don't like go near them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael McHugh, of the Refugee Youth Service, a Calais-based charity that keeps records of children in the region, told The Independent that refugees, particularly the younger ones, are being exploited by people smugglers. &quot;What we're becoming increasingly aware of is that young people are being exploited while on the move. They are being moved for the purpose of exploitation. The opportunities to cross the border have become more limited, and there's been an increase in prices - so smugglers by default are becoming traffickers. The market has opened up for it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They'll say: 'I'll get you across and you don't have to pay now but I do have a friend that you could work for in the UK'. Children are becoming more desperate and susceptible. We've had many young people who we've believed are in the UK but who we now can't find.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Refugee Youth Service refers any young person they suspect to have crossed to the Britain to a UK-based anti-trafficking agency. The charity has sent 22 referrals for minors since the beginning of August this year, of whom just seven have been located safely. Mr McHugh said a lack of a joined-up approach between British and French authorities to track the youngsters, particularly since the Home Office cut funding for an anti-trafficking service in the region, means he and other volunteers feel increasingly helpless in their efforts to protect them from trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have young people who we are trying to engage with, and we can feel the presence of adult interference. This is what gets the alarm bells ringing, but we are powerless to do much about it,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hannah Stott, programme manager of the Barnardo's child trafficking advocacy, said her agency is working with dozens of young people in the UK who were brought from northern France to the UK by traffickers, who then use &quot;sophisticated grooming techniques&quot; to lure them into forced labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They use coercion through threats of violence or whatever it might be to then lead onto that exploitation in France, on route and then when they arrive in the UK. They offer to get them to the UK for free, but then on arrival they have to pay back X amount of money - we're talking thousands or sometimes tens of thousands of dollars,&quot; she said. &quot;Many are experiencing labour exploitation, such as working in car washes, the construction industry and agriculture, with others victims to criminal exploitation, including being forced into petty crime and running drugs for highly organised criminal gangs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Stott said that along with high numbers of Vietnamese and Albanian child trafficking victims, whose plight is fairly well-documented, there has been a notable rise in the past year of young people from Sudan and Afghanistan - two of the most common nationalities sleeping rough in northern France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked what the UK was doing to prevent child trafficking from northern France to the UK, a Home Office spokesman said: &quot;We provided funding to [French organisation] France Terre d'Asile to help identify and protect victims of trafficking in the Calais camp, which was cleared in autumn 2016. The UK and France worked extremely closely to coordinate the clearance and ensure those in need of protection were moved to suitable facilities. We transferred over 900 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children to the UK from other European countries last year, including more than 750 from France as part of the UK's support for the Calais camp clearance. We continue to work closely with our French counterparts to target people traffickers and enhance security at the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local authority in Calais said border police in the region, supported by the Ocriest, the French agency responsible for tackling illegal immigration, were &quot;fighting every day against the smuggling channels across coast&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the beginning of 2017, the police have already dismantled 20 clandestine immigration networks, as much as throughout 2016. In addition, 15 investigations are currently under way, nine of which are related to the Calais region,&quot; a spokesperson said. &quot;The judicial authority imposes heavy penalties on smugglers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps, because Quakers are nothing of the sort.  We may be a small group, but our work and its effects can be felt across the country.  As a group and as individuals, Quakers are active in a wide range of causes from supporting refugees to opposing the arms trade; from pressing for divestment from fossil fuels to running food banks; from supporting the homeless to acting as Ecumenical Accompaniers helping Palestinian children travel to school safely.  Quakers are also active across the world, in trouble spots, supporting refugees, promoting reconciliation and maintaining offices at the UN in both New York and Geneva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quakers have an important contribution to make in these turbulent times.  We have no set creeds but our approach to the times in which we live is guided by a series of testimonies - to peace,  equality, truth and simplicity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our  testimony to simplicity leads us to work against the way that society judges people by their wealth and possessions.  Individuals can feel pressured to achieve and acquire. While some find this motivating, too many people feel pressured to acquire more and more and, when they fail, suffer depression and anxiety.   Children suffer bullying if they cannot fit in and the less well-off are written off as failures. Quakers recognise and value &quot;that of God in each person, and affirm the right of everyone to contribute to society and share in life's good things, beyond the basic necessities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a booklet called Advices and Queries - short thought-provoking writings which  have been drawn on for over 300 years. This is one:  &quot;Try to live simply. A simple lifestyle freely chosen is a source of great strength. Do not be persuaded into buying what you do not need or cannot afford. Do you keep yourself informed about the effects your style of living is having on the global economy and environment?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in our society dislike 'difference' - mental health issues or learning disabilities leading to behaviour or dress preferences that may evoke discomfort at best,  hostility at worst. Quakers' strong belief in equality prompts us to work for a high degree of tolerance towards one another, and ourselves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advices and Queries again: &quot;Respect the wide diversity among us in our lives and relationships... Do you foster the spirit of mutual understanding and forgiveness which our discipleship asks of us? Remember that each one of us is unique, precious, a child of God.&quot;   All of us, regardless of differences, have the same right to be respected and live the life they choose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many people, the turbulence of our times springs from the rapid social change that has affected our society.  The influx of migrants, newcomers, people with different languages and cultures.  Quakers have a long history of welcoming refugees - from Franco's Spain, from Hitler's Germany - as well as those who have arrived more recently, fleeing from conflicts and persecutions for which we bear some responsibility, but which we prefer not to accept.  &quot;Export weapons, import refugees&quot;, as the saying goes.  When we supply governments with the means to repress their populations or attack their neighbours we can hardly be surprised to  find populations on the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quakers are especially active in discouraging the scapegoating of refugees and others, blaming them for all the problems. Our testimony to truth leads us to argue that migrants and refugees are not the cause of problems such as the housing shortage and low wages.  These issues stem from complex chains of events going back long before the recent arrival of EU migrants and Syrian refugees.  It is absurd to place the blame in such a narrow quarter.   Worse, the casual scapegoating of the wrong people obscures the real reason for our problems and if we do not identify the real causes, we can never find real solutions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extreme weather, nuclear threats, political instability across the world; turbulent times indeed; we can often feel powerless in the face of such global issues.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it is in our own personal relationships with those around us that we can be most effective.  Quakers  believe each human being is unique and special. We speak of finding 'that of God' in every person.   We worship in silence, and in that silence we look to the Spirit to give us the strength and guidance to be the change that we want to see in the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are strongly committed to building a peaceful, just and sustainable world.  Over the 350 years since George Fox started the movement that became the Quakers, we have been active in prison reform, the abolition of slavery, fair working conditions and many more social movements and that continues in our work today against climate change, inequality, the arms trade and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this seems attractive to you, why not come to one of the many Quaker Meetings across Devon, Cornwall and the wider South West.  You will be made very welcome.  See  SWquakers.co.uk</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Belgian government faces widespread criticism after it invited officials from the brutal Sudanese dictatorship to Brussels to identify migrants and provide documents for their forced return to the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition politicians and groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty warned the Sudanese identification team are likely to be secret police seeking political opponents and accused the government of collaboration with the regime.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illegal migrants would be given repatriation papers, according to Theo Francken, Belgium's asylum and migration minister, but campaigners said it was very likely that genuine refugees would be faced with their&nbsp;oppressors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Francken defended his invitation to inspect about 100 migrants. He said Belgium's intelligence services had screened the three officials, who arrived in Brussels on Monday, to make sure they were not secret agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Francken, a flamboyant Flemish nationalist is notorious for his hard-line views on immigration, added: &quot;We are doing what many other European countries do with African countries. It is not exceptional to do this with Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some reports claim that the refugees, many of whom were recently arrested camping in Brussels'&nbsp;Maximilian&nbsp;Park, were on their way to Britain. While some of that number could be illegal migrants, others could be genuine asylum seekers and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;It's revolting to see Theo Francken work with the Sudanese government to send refugees back to that oppressive country,&quot; Human Rights Watch's Andrew Stroehlein told The Telegraph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has been a fugitive from the International Criminal Court since 2009, wanted on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. This is Belgium's new partner?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Germany is the most generous EU country to refugees                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition politicians demanded that Prime Minister Charles Michel, who leads Belgium's coalition government, returned from the UN General Assembly in New York to address the controversy. He will speak in the Belgian parliament on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, Mr Michel, a francophone&nbsp;liberal, said: &quot;In diplomacy, one must speak with people with whom one doesn't share the same opinions or values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Francken is a member of the conservative Flemish N-V-A party, which won the most votes in the last election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, he tweeted that a Danish national had been deported to Tunisia from Brussels airport after refusing to remove her Islamic veil. The full face veil is banned in Belgium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        &lt;table&gt;                                                                           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Danish citizen coming from Tunis refused to take off her niqaab at our border. Police could not identify her. She was sent back to Tunis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Theo Francken (@FranckenTheo) September 16, 2017                                                                                  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2014, Mr Francken faced calls for his resignation after he was pictured at a meeting to mark the 90th birthday of Bob Maes, the founder far-right Flemish organisation VMO, who was convicted after the war of collaborating with the Nazis.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Old emails later came to light in which he&nbsp;allegedly made homophobic statements and questioned the &quot;added value&quot; of migrants from Morocco, Congo and Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgium is cracking down on migrants and refugees, amid fears that Brussels, the capital of the European Union, could become home to a new &quot;Calais jungle&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">55 refugees, including 11 unaccompanied children, were arrested in the Maximilian Park in the centre of Brussels earlier this month after raids by police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT is already the world's largest refugee camp and around 400 daily arrivals are now housed in neighbouring settlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a huge task for aid agencies like Mercy Corps to help those most in need, but the organisation, which has its European base in Scotland, is  helping families through the crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 287,400 South Sudanese refugees are living in the Bidi Bidi refugee settlement in Uganda after fleeing civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the conflict has spread, and following an escalation in fighting in 2016, more than 2.2 million people have been forced to flee South Sudan and take refuge in neighbouring countries including Sudan, Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have moved to remote Bidi Bidi, a dusty area with limited shade or coverage where temperatures regularly reach around 45 degrees Celsius.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the conflict in South Sudan shows no sign of slowing down, Mercy Corps said people are slowly transitioning from temporary shelters to semi-permanent housing, that is from makeshift shelters of tarpaulins and sticks to mud huts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its response Mercy Corps has been working in Uganda since 2006 specialising in economic and market development, financial inclusion, maternal child health and nutrition, resilience, and peacebuilding and conflict management. In January 2017, Mercy Corps launched its emergency response to meet the urgent needs of vulnerable South Sudanese refugees while supporting the economy and livelihoods of both South Sudanese and Ugandans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is providing grants to the most vulnerable groups including the elderly, foster families, and people with disabilities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mercy Corps, which is The Herald's Christmas Charity, is also supporting farmers' groups by providing access to seeds and tools, as well as market links and support to sell their produce once they have harvested, and using its long-term development expertise in Uganda to link cash relief to sustainable programmes that offer livelihoods and economic support to some of the most vulnerable South Sudanese and Ugandan people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those who received a first Mercy Corps emergency cash payment was Tabu Night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tabu, 60, and her family have been living in Bidi Bidi refugee settlement for a year.  They fled from their village in Central Equatoria region when the conflict spread there last year.  She started a business with the 38,000 Ugandan shillings (&pound;8) she received from Mercy Corps each month for six months.  She now earns on average 20,000 Ugandan shillings from her stall each week.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;I also used the money to buy the silver fish and the onion [to sell in the stall].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So when I came here it was this organisation [Mercy Corps] that helped us to survive and if it's not because of this organisation by this time we would have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I wasn't able to start the business, I don't know what would have happened [to us].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Lodinya, 82, and his wife Suzanne Akujo, 60, fled their home in Morobo County, South Sudan, and have also benefited from Mercy Corps emergency cash support, also receiving six months of payments so that they could supplement their food and start their own stall.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil urged people to &acirc;(EURO)oetreat others as you would like to be treated&acirc;(EURO), as his bill to improve the rights of refugees was presented in the Commons yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SNP politician was drawn in seventh place in the private members&acirc;(EURO)(TM) bill (PMB) ballot, which means his proposed new law has a chance of making it onto the statute book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has put forward the Refugees Family Reunion Bill, which aims to stop families from being &acirc;(EURO)oebroken up by bureaucracy&acirc;(EURO).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If passed, it would enable children to sponsor parents to come to the UK, which is not permitted under current rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would also provide for legal aid to be made available for family reunion cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr MacNeil, who has been an MP since 2005, told the Press and Journal his bill has the backing of several groups, including the British Red Cross, Refugee Council, Amnesty International and Oxfam, as well as MPs from across the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those supporting it are Conservative Anna Soubry, outgoing Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Labour&acirc;(EURO)(TM)s Stella Creasy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford&acirc;(EURO)(TM)s name is also on the list of supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr MacNeil said the proposed legislation would bring the UK into line with the rest of Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &acirc;(EURO)oeYou hope in politics you manage to achieve things. This is something worthy of achieving that would make a difference to people&acirc;(EURO)(TM)s lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;(EURO)oeI hope the UK Government will back it. It should get behind it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;(EURO)oeRefugees value their children just as much as everybody else. Refugees are people like me or you who because of geopolitics have had to flee. That&acirc;(EURO)(TM)s all a refugee is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;(EURO)oeWe can&acirc;(EURO)(TM)t see the future. Who knows something might happen that would force us to flee. Then we would become refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If successful, he will follow in the footsteps of former Banff and Buchan MP Eilidh Whiteford, who became the first-ever SNP representative to steer a PMB through to royal assent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aimed at tackling violence against women, she succeeded after obtaining cross-party support and Theresa May&acirc;(EURO)(TM)s backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PMBs are a rare opportunity for MPs who are not ministers to make their mark by bringing in legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty names were drawn in last month&acirc;(EURO)(TM)s ballot, but as time for debating the bills is limited to just 13 Fridays in each parliamentary session, only the top seven are likely to get heard. As a result, most are unlikely to become law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saira Grant, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, welcomed Mr MacNeil&acirc;(EURO)(TM)s choice of topic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &acirc;(EURO)oeThis bill will ensure that children who have faced extraordinary hardship in their lives, and finally received sanctuary in the UK, will no longer have to face the additional trauma of being separated from their parents by an arbitrary and illogical gap in the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;(EURO)oeMost children in this position remain separated from their parents. This bill would remove the unfair obstacle to vulnerable refugee children being reunited with their parents.&acirc;(EURO)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Science in Exile, directed by Nicole Leghissa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GHANYA NAJI AL-NAQEB left Yemen because she felt her life was at risk. &quot;In my faculty, a few people disappeared. We don't know anything about them,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her story isn't unique. Millions fled Africa and the Middle East when conflict and war closed in. But as a scientist, Naji Al-Naqeb may have been in greater danger since authoritarian regimes often target this group because of their knowledge and influence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is hard to get exact numbers, thousands of science students and professionals are thought to be among those seeking refuge. Now they are the focus of a documentary by Italian artist and film-maker Nicole Leghissa. Her </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Science in Exile</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recently premiered at the World Science Forum in Jordan, and will be shown globally in 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film explores the journey of Naji Al-Naqeb and three other refugee scientists from Syria and Iraq, now pursuing careers far from their homes. &quot;It was hard to find displaced scientists who want to talk,&quot; says Leghissa. &quot;Many are scared.&quot; They were also hard to find physically because they may live in camps or not work in their own field of science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when refugee scientists receive a fellowship or are offered a job, the transition can be tough. Many struggle to get a visa or may find their knowledge isn't up to scratch because of different educational standards. Loneliness is also a big issue for those who leave families behind. Then there's racism. &quot;It's especially an issue for women wearing veils who are on their own,&quot; says Leghissa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even job offers are rarely for permanent posts, adding to feelings of instability. After being uprooted, refugee scientists worry about what will happen if their host country can no longer accommodate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmad Sadiddin is a Syrian agricultural economist featured in the film. He relocated to Italy, and for him the lack of stability was the hardest part. &quot;I was offered a position at a university for two years and it was obvious that it was just a transitional phase,&quot; he says. &quot;I was anxious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loneliness is a big issue for the refugee scientists who left families behind. Then there's racism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are upsides, of course. Naji Al-Naqeb, now in Germany studying Yemeni plants used in traditional medicine, has access to expertise and technology not available at home. And Sadiddin now works at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, where he is gaining an international perspective to complement his role as a national adviser in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But previous experience helps too. Sadiddin's knowledge of the Middle East, where there are already water and food shortages due to climate change, has been an asset when working on models of the financial impact of global warming in some countries in the Middle East and North Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many refugees hope to return to their countries eventually. For Leghissa, they are bridges: having worked in very different cultures, they bring a unique knowledge. She says: &quot;They are big resources for their countries economically, and socially.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If she is able to return to Yemen, Naji Al-Naqeb may be able to boost her country's economy by setting up a lab to develop medicines from Yemeni plants. And Sadiddin thinks that developing a labour force skilled in science and technology will play a part in repairing Syria's destruction. Before the war, he says, there were only five public universities for 23 million people. Scientists were not paid well and there was no freedom of expression, two things he thinks are necessary for science to grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee scientists have a lot to contribute, but they need more support too. Several organisations and scholarship funds offer financial help, but less emotional support is available, and many institutions aren't clued up about refugees' experiences. Leghissa thinks ongoing assistance should be available, including help if they opt to resettle. Meanwhile, raising awareness is a big step forward.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His cartoons were steeped in controversy and led to dozens ofdeath threatsand a warning to reportedly 'correct his attitude' before he was gunned down in the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naji Salim Hussain al-Ali was one of the most infamous political cartoonists of his time, and at the time of his death worked for Al-Qabas, a Kuwaiti newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father of four became a prominent political satirist in the 1970s and 1980s, producing cartoons critical of both the Arab world and Palestine leadership - gaining him fans as well as a number of enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his death there were claims he had been killed to silence critics of the Palestinian regime, and that Israel had known of the plan to assassinate him all along.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Naji walked to his office in Knightsbridge in London at about 5.15pm on 22 July 1987, he was shot in the back of the neck. The 49-year-old was in a coma for four weeks after the shooting and died a month later in Charing Cross Hospital on 29 August - exactly 30 years ago today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wars of the world: The 22 conflicts around the globe that threaten to erupt into major military standoff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a high-profile investigation into his death known as Operation Amazon, Naji's killer or killers were never found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 30 years on detectives from the Metropolitan Police CounterTerrorismCommand are re -investigating the case, which was initially led by Met Police Special Branch detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naji was born in 1938 in a small Palestinian village which was later destroyed by Israel. When he was just 10 he had to flee the village with his family, and ended up living in Lebanon where they stayed in a refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later became a political cartoonist using his illustrations to hit out at the corruption he saw in Palestine and the Arab world. One of his most famous works was Handala, a word which means bitterness. Handala -or Hanthala - was a refugee boy who never showed his face and appeared in many of Naji's works from 1969 as a symbol of the plight of Palestinian refugees and their defiance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing him, Naji previously said: &quot;Handala is not a fat, happy, relaxed, or pampered child. He is barefooted like the refugee camp children, and he is an icon that protects me from making mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naji produced around 40,000 cartoons during his career depicting the plight of Palestinian refugees, which he had first hand experience of. Many of these images still exist today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his life Naji is said to have received around 100 death threats. He lived in Lebanon, Beiruit and Saudi Arabia - and moved his family to Kuwait for their safety. However, due to the criticism surrounding his work, the authorities quickly moved him and his family away and they settled in London where he worked for Al-Qabas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he was living in Lebanon in 1982, Naji witnessed the war launched by Israel to try to destroy the PLO, and felt his people had been betrayed and would have to accept a state alongside Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His son Khaled previously toldthe Guardian: &quot;For him the Zionists were the enemy, but his problem with the PLO was that its policies wouldn't have taken him back to Galilee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colleagues reported that weeks before his death he received a call, warning him not to attack Yasser Arafat and telling him: &quot;You must correct your attitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984 The Guardian described Naji as &quot;the nearest thing there is to an Arab public opinion&quot; and in 1988 he received a posthumous 'Golden Pen of Freedom' award from the International Federation of Newspaper Publishers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of his death there were claims that he had been killed in a plot organised by thePalestine Liberation Organisation(PLO) to silence its critics. This was denied by the PLO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also claimed Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, had known of the plot and had been monitoring the suspect using a double agent within the PLO,the Timesreported. When PLO member Ishmail Hassan Sowan gave evidence at his trial for hoarding weapons and explosives he claimed he was a double agent, working with Mossad to track Abdul Rahim Mustapha. It emerged that Mustapha was questioned about the murder of Naji.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By refusing to pass on information to Britain, Mossad infuriated their UK counterparts and three Israeli diplomats were expelled. Margaret Thatcher also closed Mossad's London base in Kensington, ordering the closure 24 hours after Sowan was found convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of Naji's murder 10 people were arrested as police investigated the killing, but no one was charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The year of his death in 1987 was a time of increasing tension between Palestine and Israel - and Naji's death took place before an uprising of Palestine against the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza by Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, on the afternoon of his shooting, Naji had parked his car in Ixworth Place, walked down into Draycott Avenue and onto Ives Street in Knightsbridge. It was here that he was followed by a suspected gunman, according to witnesses, who had been described as Middle-Eastern, about 25 with thick black hair. He was wearing a stonewashed denim jacket and dark trousers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was said to be walking close to Naji for about 40 seconds before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the attack, the suspect was seen to run out of Ives Street back across Draycott Avenue and into Ixworth Place. A witness reported seeing another man crossing Fulham Road into Lucan Place and getting into the driver's seat of a silver-grey left-hand drive Mercedes shortly after the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was seen running with his left hand inside the right side of his jacket as if he was hiding something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, this man was described as being of Middle-Eastern appearance, aged in his 50s, about 5ft 9ins and of medium build but with heavy shoulders. He was said to have dark bushy hair with a lot of grey in it, a fattish face and a bigger than average nose. He was clean-shaven and of smart appearance, wearing a grey suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mercedes was seen driving off along Lucan Place and left into Ixworth Place, towards the junction with Sloane Avenue. It is believed that the registration number of the car contained the letters P and H in the first part and may have ended 11L.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gun used to kill Naji - a 7.62 Tokarev pistol - was found in open space on the Hallfield Estate in Paddington almost two years after the murder, on 22 April 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commander Dean Haydon, head of the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command, said: &quot;The brutal murder of Mr Al-Ali devastated his family and 30 years on they continue to feel the loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have previously reviewed this case and followed a number of lines of enquiry which have not resulted in us identifying these two men. However, a lot can change in 30 years - allegiances shift and people who were not willing to speak at the time of the murder may now be prepared to come forward with crucial information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We remain open-minded about the motive for Mr Al-Ali's murder and we believe there are people somewhere who have information that could help us bring those responsible for his murder to justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone with information is urged to call the investigation team on 020 3276 9014, or 0044 203 276 9014 if calling from outside the UK. Alternatively, to remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. In each case please quote &quot;Operation Amazon&quot;. Alternatively, email amazon@met.pnn.police.uk</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This means that under [maritime laws to prevent collisions] the vessel is considered 'not under command' and information was sent out to vessels nearby in accordance with regulations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, an offshoot of the white nationalist Identitarian movement, crowdfunded its ship with claims it would target &quot;criminal NGOs...that are nothing less than part of the international human trafficking ring&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defend Europe claims the rescuing of refugees from the Mediterranean Sea, where more than 2,400 men, women and children have drowned so far this year, is part of an &quot;invasion&quot; endangering the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission has been beset with difficulties that saw it delayed by several weeks, switching the launch to Cyprus from Sicily, where anti-racist campaigners and journalists had gathered last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C-Star, a chartered ship, was stopped in the Suez Canal for security checks before journeying to northern Cyrus, where crew members were arrested over people smuggling allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were later freed after claiming that Sri Lankan crew members on board were &quot;apprentice sailors&quot; who were supposed to disembark in Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian groups raised concern that Defend Europe could endanger lives in the Central Mediterranean if it interrupts rescue missions, but the group now claims it is merely &quot;monitoring&quot; NGO activity and will conduct refugee rescues if needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, activists on board have been shouting at humanitarian ships through megaphones and &quot;trolling&quot; other crews including the Spanish charity Provactiva Open Arms over radio by ordering them to leave the search and rescue zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Timm, a German member of the group, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the C-Star would &quot;not interfere&quot; with humanitarian operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are called, we will help,&quot; he added. &quot;But we would make sure that they [the migrants] don't get to Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Timm claimed the C-Star would take asylum seekers to the &quot;closest safe African harbour&quot; instead of Italy and named Tunis as a possibility, although Tunisian authorities are not believed to have agreed to the plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU accused of 'wilfully letting refugees drown' in the Med</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refuted the far-right label applied to the group and called Defend Europe a &quot;democratic movement&quot;, adding: &quot;You can be against net immigration to Europe and on the other hand you can be compassionate with the people that drown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From our prospective people don't drown because of 'Fortress Europe', but these NGOs are working as a pull factor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activist claimed his organisation would help enforce a controversial code of conduct imposed by Italy, which only three of eight groups operating rescue ships have so far signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Timm claimed Defend Europe has &quot;a lot of evidence&quot; to support its position but studies including a recent report by a House of Lords committeehave not found any proofof NGO activity causing increased deaths or crossings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research has found the EU's Operation Sophia anti-smuggling mission could itself be increasing death rates by causing smugglers to switch from wooden vessels to flimsy dinghies that cannot survive the treacherous crossing to Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors in Sicily have ordered the seizure of one of eight humanitarian rescue ships operating in the Mediterranean - the Iuventa - over allegations its crew had contact with Libyan smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian coastguard rescues refugee boat from Libya in the Mediterranean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambrogio Cartosio, a public prosecutor from Trapani, said there was evidence some members of German charity Jugend Rettet had contact with smugglers during one incident in September and two others in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he stressed that there was no evidence of the group receiving any money from Libyan traffickers and no indication of a wider conspiracy between the two groups - a favourite theory of the European far-right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My personal conviction was that the motive is humanitarian, exclusively humanitarian,&quot; Mr Cartosio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be fantasy to say there was a coordinated plan between the NGOs and the Libyan traffickers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU is training and equipping the Libyan coastguard, which is itself accused of killing, beating and abusing migrants, and has given millions of pounds towards detention centres and other controls by the fragile Libyan Government of National Accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has warned of widespread rape, abuse, forced labour, kidnapping and ransom in the country, where smugglers have expanded a profitable trade in the chaos of the continuing Libyan civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country is now the main launching point for overloaded boats to Europe, where almost 120,000 migrants have arrived so far this year, mainly from Nigeria, Guinea, Bangladesh, Syria, the Ivory Coast and other sub-Saharan African countries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU was accused of 'raping' its own values yesterday after its top court ruled that countries should be forced to accept refugees under a relocation scheme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an escalating row over its migration policy, Brussels threatened to sanction any member states who refuse to comply after the European Court of Justice dismissed a complaint about the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the warning was met with a furious response by Eastern European countries who have opposed the system, highlighting escalating splits over how to deal with the ongoing migration crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling came after Hungary and Slovakia asked the ECJ to quash an EU decision to share 120,000 refugees in Italy and Greece at the height of Europe's migrant influx in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary accused the Luxembourg court of making an 'outrageous and irresponsible' politically driven decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said: 'Politics has raped European law and European values.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This decision practically and openly legitimates the power of the EU above the member states.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Brussels expects previously non-compliant countries to accept refugees within weeks, Mr Szijjarto pre-empted a bitter stand-off by saying 'all legal means' would be used to oppose the decision. He added: 'The real battle is only just beginning.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary has refused to accept a single refugee as part of its hard-line response to the crisis that also saw an electronic fence being built along its border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument comes after months of increasingly hostile political debate between Eastern European countries and Brussels over its handling of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Brussels has insisted the move is necessary to help deal with the 1.6 million people who arrived in Greece and Italy since 2014, the countries say it is not their responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also say that opening their borders to refugees from migrants from war-torn countries such as Syria could leave them open to the threat of terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the UK has an opt-out on EU rules regarding asylum, it decided not to take part in the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beata Szydlo, the Polish prime minister, said: 'We expected this decision. However, this does not change the position of the Polish government on migration policy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slovakia prime minister Robert Fico said his government 'fully respects the court's decision' but added that the quotas were 'politically wrong'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ECJ's ruling said: 'The court dismisses the actions brought by Slovakia and Hungary against the provisional mechanism for the mandatory relocation of asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That mechanism actually contributes to enabling Greece and Italy to deal with the impact of the 2015 migration crisis and is proportionate.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said the court's decision was an opportunity to end in-fighting between member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said those countries that refused to take part could be referred to the ECJ and potentially face sizeable fines for breaching EU law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is time to be united and show full solidarity,' Mr Avramopoulos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The door remains, it is still open, and we should convince all member states to fulfil their commitments.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christmas Day marks exactly four months since the start of the latest influx of Rohingya into Bangladesh from Myanmar. An estimated 830,000 people - seven times the population of my Edmonton constituency - now live on the border. More arrive every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one month, half a million arrived. That is the highest monthly exodus of refugees anywhere on the planet since the Rwandan genocide. M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res has documented at least 6,700 deaths from violence, but the real number is likely to be much higher. The world is outraged at the savagery of the atrocities, at the sexual violence, at the torture, at the discriminationand at the sheer impunity of General Min Aung Hlaing and the failure of Myanmar's military leaders to face consequences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for all the outrage, the world has not done nearly enough. A long-term political solution will require much more. Earlier this month, Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee passed judgement on what else the UK Government could have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are immediate and massive humanitarian needs that risk being forgotten as the news cycle moves on. A recent International Rescue Committee assessment found that 95 per cent of people are drinking untreated water, risking a cholera outbreak. Nearly 60 million litres of safe water - the equivalent of 23 Olympic-sized swimming pools - are needed every day; 40 per cent of children are currently malnourished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drone footage shows thousands of </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslims fleeing Myanmar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women are in particular danger: horrific accounts continue to emerge of systematic rape, abuse and torture at the hands of the Myanmar military, while there is only limited support for recovery and treatment in the camps. Access to even basic healthcare and education is severely restricted. Shelter needs too are acute: camps sprang up rapidly, without sufficient planning or space to expand. Hundreds of thousands will sleep in 2018 crowded under tarpaulins propped up by bamboo sticks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plight of the Rohingya began long before August, and there is no quick end in sight. The chances are that whole generations will now spend their lives in Bangladesh as refugees. That is why the medium-term response in Bangladesh matters so much. International donors have already pledged some $344m (&pound;257m) towards the response. That includes &pound;59m from the UK - our aid provision has been both swift and generous. But governments and international institutions must now step up in the months ahead, and agree a much bigger financial package with Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We mustn't be distracted from our duties towards Rohingya refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That support must be tied to a progressive refugee policy that will provide refugees with access to work, education, citizenship rightsand a future, without putting further strain on already stretched public services. There are important lessons to learn from similar influxes in Uganda, Jordan, and Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But right now, that progressive, positive, outcome looks a long way away for the Rohingya. Rather than welcome and integrate, the government of Bangladesh is now activating a costly plan to transfer 100,000 Rohingya to Bhashan Char, a currently uninhabited island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of November, the governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar also agreed to return and repatriate Rohingya to Myanmar - the very country they fled just weeks ago - with support from the UK and other countries. It is reported that repatriation and refugee returns could start as soon as January, just a few weeks away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Government says it is seeking assurances that repatriations will only happen if they are safe, voluntaryand dignified. But according to human rights groups surveying refugees on the ground, many neither want to return nor believe it is yet safe to do so. That is hardly surprising when you consider their horrific experience at the hands of the military, or that a repeat cycle of counter-insurgency human rights violations is highly likely in future. We now know that the assurances of civilian leaders like Aung Sang Suu Kyi count for little in a country still dominated by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What one volunteer witnessed from the frontline of the Rohingya crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the UK Government receives far stronger and more credible assurances and evidence that any returns will indeed be safe, voluntary and dignified, and until UN agencies have full confidence in the arrangement, the UK must not support an agreement that could put thousands more Rohingya lives in serious danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Christmas Day, four months on from the start of the crisis, we should focus not on how the Rohingya can be sent back, but on how we can help provide short-term help, and long-term sanctuary. The UK must help the Rohingya, not send them back into danger.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Myanmar newspaper The Myanmar Times website on 24 November</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repatriation of thousands of Muslims from Northern Rakhine, who fled to Bangladesh to escape the recent spate of violence there, would start soon following the signing of a deal between Myanmar and Bangladesh on Thursday [23 November], officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The memorandum of understanding was signed at 2:00pm [local time] this afternoon (Thursday),&quot;  U Myint Kyaing, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population, told The Myanmar Times via  telephone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union Minister for the Office of the State Counsellor, U Kyaw Tint Swe and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali inked the agreement in Nay Pyi Taw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But U Myint Kyaing declined to hazard a guess as to when the actual repatriation could start saying , it will be the Foreign Affairs Ministry which will release the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said that applications forms will be sent to Bangladesh for the refugees to fill up with their personal details and the completed forms will be returned to Myanmar for verification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If these (personal details) are all right, the repatriation would be arranged immediately,&quot; U Myint Kyaing said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has prepared new villages to accommodate the refugees, including the Taung Pyo Letwe and Nga Khu Ya villages in Maungdaw township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union Minister for Social Welfare Relief and Resettlement Dr Win Myat Aye said Myanmar is not shirking from its responsibility to the more than 600,000 refugees from Northern Rakhine now living in squalid makeshifts camps in Cox's Bazar district in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would like to actually implement it (repatriation) because it is our responsibility. Regardless of the reason for fleeing their homes, we have to accept them back. It is the duty of the state,&quot; he said on the eve of the signing of the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In whichever ways they migrated, to arrange for systematic resettlement for them is our duty. Whatever happened, to provide humanitarian aids to them is the duty of the government. We are carrying out the duty of the government,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent spate of violence in northern Rakhine erupted on August 25 when the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) terrorist group launched simultaneous attacks on over two dozen government security forces outposts in the towns of Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks triggered reprisals by government troops and clashes with ARSA fighters that resulted in the killing of hundreds of people and the disappearance of over a hundred more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, US State Secretary Rex Tillerson said Washington fully support Myanmar's efforts to bring back the refugees and to normalize the situation in northern Rakhine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We support the Burmese government's commitment to create the conditions necessary for all refugees and internally displaced people to return to their homes safely and voluntarily and welcome recent exchanges between the governments of Burma and Bangladesh on repatriation,&quot; he said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a difficult and complex situation,&quot; he added. &quot;Many stakeholders must work together to ensure progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tillerson urged the Tatmadaw to fully support the government's efforts to repatriate the refugees and to normalise the situation in Rakhine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that the US would consider targeted sanctions against those responsible for the recent violence in the area, which he said &quot;constitutes ethnic cleansing&quot; against the local Muslim population there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ethnic cleansing term surfaced in the context of the 1990s conflict in the former Yugoslavia, when a UN commission defined it as &quot;rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area,&quot; according to an AP report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that ethnic cleansing isn't recognised as an independent crime under international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tillerson attributed the atrocities in the area to &quot;some among the Burmese military, security forces, and local vigilantes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to press statement of the State Counsellor's Office, the agreement signed on Thursday was based on the Joint Statement signed by the Myanmar government and Bangladesh in 1992 and contained the general guiding principles and policy arrangements to systematically verify and receive the displaced persons from Rakhine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most citizens of Myanmar consider the majority of Muslims in Rakhine as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite having lived in the area for generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The present agreement, which had been agreed to by both countries based on their friendly and good neighbourly relations, demonstrate the steadfast position of Myanmar and is a win-win situation for both countries,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whistling and shouting reached its climax when Angela Merkel insisted that Germany's strength lay in its diversity and thanked her audience for helping to cope with the influx of migrants. Some politicians might shy away from mentioning the issue that has damaged them the most and has stirred up the greatest anger - especially when visiting the heartland of her most vociferous opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not Angela Merkel. The long-serving chancellor came to the former East Germany on the election trail this week and defended her refugee policy, despite the noise made by a small number of nationalists. From the summer of 2015 when she allowed in tens of thousands of asylum seekers stranded in Hungary, about a million more have come to Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know the past years were not easy,&quot; she began, as hecklers in the open-air venue in the town of Apolda chanted &quot;liar, liar&quot; and &quot;Merkel must go&quot;. From vantage points around the edge of the 2,000-strong crowd police kept watch through binoculars while other officers mingled with the two dozen people doing the heckling. Mrs Merkel likes to address rallies without protective screening and it makes the security services palpably nervous.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2015, when so many refugees arrived, I often talked to district administrators about how we could manage all this,&quot; she said. &quot;I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many helpers and officials who worked so hard in a humanitarian emergency so that we managed this big challenge and provided protection for people who needed it. Thank you for your commitment. That showed the good side of Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even among her core supporters some doubt the wisdom of her refugee policy - but they still believe she is the best choice for chancellor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was perhaps her one mistake,&quot; said Ramona, a nurse, who travelled from the nearby city of Erfurt to hear Mrs Merkel speak. &quot;It is going to be tough in the next few years - it was just young men who came, and they have to find work. But we are standing by Merkel. It was the ethical thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winfried Moeller, 66, a car dealer, was angry with European countries for leaving the problem to Germany. &quot;We are a people of 80 million, we can take in a few www.refugees.No one has ever starved to death in Germany or was in misery because of these few refugees,&quot; he said. &quot;This is important. Merkel is a Christian, her father was a pastor. Naturally, she thinks like a Christian and acted accordingly. She could not have done otherwise. What she did was right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel is comfortably ahead in opinion polls for the election on September 24 and heading for a fourth four-year term. Most analysts believe the real question is her margin of victory, and which party will join her in a coalition. Her Christian Democratic Union is fed up with the &quot;grand coalition&quot; with the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) led by Martin Schulz. The feeling is mutual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A combination of factors explain Mrs Merkel's enduring appeal, including luck. She reaped the benefit of difficult labour market reforms by Gerhard Schr&ouml;der, her SPD predecessor, which partly explain Germany's 3.8 per cent unemployment rate, the second-lowest in the EU. This masks a large class of working poor, with the bottom 40 per cent of Germans having almost no assets or bank savings. But since she saw off Mr Schr&ouml;der in 2005 she has not faced a popular rival, either within her own party or from the SPD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In eastern Germany the nationalist AfD has the highest support but nationally it is polling at barely 8 per cent. One of Mrs Merkel's hecklers, Erwin Schmidt, 70, said: &quot;She has divided the German people with her asylum policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She let in illegal immigrants without passport or papers, she opened the doors for terrorism, for Islam, and we do not want her any longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born Angela Kasner, she excelled as a student in Russian and physics and spent her first 35 years behind the Iron Curtain. She married Ulrich Merkel at 23 and although the union lasted only five years she the name, even after remarrying in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her biographers draw parallels between her father's parsonage, a close-knit sanctuary from intrusive communist rule where one word out of place was sufficient to end careers, and her fiercely loyal chancellery &quot;family&quot; in Berlin. It also helps to explain the pathological care she takes to weigh her words and mull decisions, and the value she places on the discretion of her closest advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another lucky asset has been the political turmoil beyond Germany's borders. Poland is in the grip of a constitutional crisis after choosing the rightwing Law and Justice party, while to the east Turkey and Russia provide further warnings of the dangers of nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her election speech referred to &quot;shock&quot; at Brexit and &quot;worries&quot; that the far right could have won elections in France and the Netherlands. Amid the chaos, Germans feel they should stick with &quot;Mutti&quot; (mummy), as she is known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She stands for constancy, for security,&quot; said Gerret, 53, who works for a tiling company in Apolda. &quot;We are doing well in Germany. We don't like experiments.&quot; ? President Erdogan has told ethnic Turks in Germany not to vote for the two parties in Angela Merkel's ruling coalition in next month's elections. Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) were hostile to Turkey, he said. So were the opposition Greens. &quot;I tell all my kinsmen in Germany ... not to vote for them. Neither the Christian Democrats nor the SPD nor the Greens. They are all enemies of Turkey,&quot; Mr Erdogan said in Istanbul. &quot;It is necessary to teach a lesson at the ballot box to these political parties, who have disrespected Turkey.&quot; He accused the SPD and CDU of abusing Turkey to gain greater popular support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany has criticised Turkey over the crackdown that followed last year's failed coup. Sigmar Gabriel, the foreign minster, called Mr Erdogan's comments an &quot;unprecedented act of interference&quot; in German sovereignty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee held by Australia on Nauru has pleaded with the government to be reunited with his pregnant wife in Brisbane, so he can be present for the birth of his first child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Farahi has been held on Nauru for more than four years. His wife, Ahin*, is currently in detention in Brisbane, 24 weeks pregnant with their first child. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nauru, Ahin was acutely unwell with hyperemesis gravidarum - severe morning sickness - and her pregnancy was further complicated when she contracted dengue fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian doctors have stated she is too unwell to return to Nauru, where medical facilities - especially the country's obstetric services - are inadequate to treat her condition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mohammed has been told by Australian authorities he will not be allowed to support his wife when she gives birth, nor see his child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My wife is calling me every night, crying,&quot; Mohammed told the Guardian. &quot;She says 'I want to come back to you but I cannot'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed said he had made multiple requests to the Australian Border Force - and repeatedly pleaded with on-island case managers - to allow him to support his wife and to see his baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they just refuse,&quot; he said. &quot;They don't listen, they don't care. This is my family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is so horrible. Every day I am praying to die but I cannot do anything, just I pray every night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's offshore detention regime has separated several families between Australia and the offshore islands of Nauru and Manus, some for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, with increasing government efforts to close the offshore regime, a number of families now face permanent separation. The Guardian understands there are at least four fathers on Nauru who have never seen their children and face the possibility of never being able to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian reported last month on the case of Iranian refugee Arash, who has never seen or held his infant daughter, Yusra, who is now seven months old and in community detention in Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was sent documents by the Australian Border Force to relinquish custody of his child in order to be able to apply for resettlement in the US as a single person. He has refused to abandon his family. He has still not been reunited with his family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My daughter, she is innocent - she has the right to see her father,&quot; Arash told the Guardian this week. &quot;I have never held my daughter, never looked at her with my own eyes. Pictures are all I have of her. And they do this just to be cruel, just to cause pain to me and my family. To be heartless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family unity is a fundamental principle of international and Australian domestic law. Australia is a party to the convention on the rights of the child, which states that children have a right to know and be cared for by their parents, and should grow up in a family environment wherever possible. It is also a party to the international covenant on civil and political rights, which says the family &quot;is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is crying every day, 'I can't stay here, take me back, I need my husband'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mohammed Farahi    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Farahi told the Guardian that when Ahin fell pregnant she was acutely unwell and he feared she would die without intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When she was here on Nauru, she was vomiting, sometimes 20 times a day, losing too much weight. There is no food for her here she could eat. No vegetables, fresh fruit is not available in Nauru, or it is too expensive for us to buy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and his wife initially considered termination because she was so unwell. But because termination is illegal in Nauru, and the lone hospital on the island routinely refuses to transfer patients for the procedure, Ahin's pregnancy progressed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The baby was moving inside my wife's stomach, it was kicking,&quot; Mohammed said. &quot;Now, I love the baby. I love the baby. But here, she was hurting so much. She couldn't eat anything. That's why she had to go to Australia for medical care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 20 weeks pregnant on Nauru, and with her condition deteriorating, Ahin was taken to Brisbane, where she remains in held detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is crying every day, 'I can't stay here, take me back, I need my husband'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed, a member of Iran's Kurdish ethnic minority, fled the country with his wife after facing systematic government persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They arrived by boat on Christmas Island in 2013 and have been in detention, offshore and on, since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both have been formally recognised as refugees, with authorities finding they faced a well-founded fear of persecution in their homeland. They are legally owed protection and cannot be returned to Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have both applied for resettlement in the US but their case has stalled with their separation, and with progress of the US deal slowing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want to be with my wife anywhere in the world,&quot; Mohammed said. &quot;They can send us anywhere but I need to be with my wife and my child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this place, I cannot sleep at all. I am very afraid, because of some of the troublesome thoughts that come to my mind. I have no hope for the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  An impossible choice: the Nauru refugee forced to choose between family and freedom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other fathers on Nauru have been told they face permanent separation from their families. They have been told by Australian government officials they cannot apply for resettlement in the US as a family while they are separated from their wives and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fathers have been told they can either ask their wives and children to return to the island - where some have been assaulted or in defiance of medical advice - so the family can apply for US resettlement together, or sign forms to relinquish all custody rights to their child and to apply for resettlement as a single person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration department does not comment on specific cases. But the department secretary, Mike Pezzullo, told Senate estimates there was a &quot;general expectation&quot; that refugees would return to either Nauru or Manus in order to be considered for resettlement in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the general expectation is that they would return to their regional processing location, if there is a particular vulnerability, or for compassionate reasons, I can see there could be a circumstance where the minister or the minister's delegate might allow them to come to a different view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said, in practice, the separation of family members was a deliberate, punitive government policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The policy has destroyed and is destroying, families and relationships. It is a Sophie's Choice situation; accept the anguish and trauma of separation from loved ones, or risk that return of a loved one to Nauru might scar their future and irreparably damage their mental health.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rintoul said the separation policy was enforced more strictly now that legal action was often being taken to kept refugees transferred to Australia in the country. He said those left behind on Nauru were being used as &quot;hostages&quot; in an attempt to coerce family members back offshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The uncertainty of the US deal only adds to the anguish,&quot; Rintoul said. &quot;Families are being told that they will not be considered for the US deal until they are all on Nauru but are not being told whether or not they will be accepted by the US. So, they are effectively being coerced to return without knowing if they will ever be able to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is magnified for anyone with children. There is no future for children on Nauru; there are severe limitations on health care which are about to get worse; and there is little hope for a proper education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokeswoman for the UNHCR's Regional Representation in Canberra, Catherine Stubberfield, said that in addition to both Nauru and PNG being inappropriate of places of even temporary settlement for refugees and asylum seekers, &quot;some have endured specific instances of harm that make return even more detrimental&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To ask women who have been assaulted to return to the country of that incident, where no prosecutions or investigations have taken place, would be unthinkable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite everything else she has been through, one refugee woman told UNHCR recently, 'the greatest strain on my family's well-being is our separation'. This echoes the sentiments of many.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR resettlement handbook states that, wherever possible, refugee family members should always be resettled together. But Stubberfield said refugees and asylum seekers within Australia's offshore system faced a desperate decision between remaining in indefinite limbo and being relocated without their loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While return of any refugees or asylum-seekers to 'offshore processing' locations is inappropriate given the lack of necessary services and support, in instances of trauma and other complications, any such requirement would be even harsher.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His parents told me that every time the phone rang they would think &quot;that's it, they've been hit by a bomb or a bullet&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This experience reinforces to me why the law on reuniting refugee families in the UK desperately needs to change and why I support Oxfam's campaign for this to happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday 16 March next year, MPs will debate a Private Members Bill proposed by Scottish MP Angus &shy;MacNeil which could enable more refugees to be reunited here in the UK. It's the opportunity of a lifetime for the families affected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, a refugee who has reached the UK is only entitled to apply for their partner, and their children who are under the age of 18, to join them. However, if the child instead makes the treacherous &shy;journey to the UK on their own, then - as the law stands - the child is not entitled to be reunited with their parents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond this, the law also separates refugees from their children who are aged over 18, their brothers, &shy;sisters, parents and grandparents; all of whom may be left alone in hostile environments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office amended their Family Reunion Policy in July 2016. On the face of it, this appeared to many as a welcome and long-awaited change, designed to account for the harrowing situation in war zones such as Syria. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why then do they continue to enforce such restrictive rules? Where applications for family reunion are denied, it remains possible to appeal the decision and to bring it to court. However, that process takes, on average, between eight to 12 months. People in war zones like Syria or Iraq are lucky to make it to the end of the week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reams of case law show there is a clear need to make family reunification easier and judges of the highest courts have criticised the family reunion rules. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International law is also clear. When states, including the UK, adopted the UN Refugee Convention in 1951, they stressed in their final act that the unity of the family is an essential right of the refugee.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child also imposes specific obligations on states in family reunification cases that involve children. It requires states to protect children against separation from their parents against their will. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, I won the case of the &shy;Syrian boy and his three sisters were able to rejoin their family here in the UK. But that should never have been in doubt and others continue to face spending this festive season separated from their loved ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have recently presented an appeal to a judge about another child whose parents remain stranded in Syria. The boy told me of his nightmares about what is happening to his &shy;parents. He says he may decide to cross dangerous territories into war zones just to be with them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His psychologist has told me she thinks he could be suicidal. But, as it stands, the law says he is not &shy;entitled to be reunited with his parents in the UK. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot allow such situations to continue to unfold. That's why I'm supporting Oxfam's call for all MPs from Scotland and across the UK, including all those who claim to stand up for family values, to turn up when the Bill on family reunion is debated. Lives depend on it. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN African refugee jailed twice for sex attacks has won a &pound;110,000 payout for being caged too long after his own country refused to take him back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aliou Bah, 28, was imprisoned twice for serious assaults - including one on a 16-year-old girl - and put on the sex offenders' register.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he spent an extra 21 months in prison because immigration officials in Guinea in West Africa refused to process his travel papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The block scuppered a bid to deport him by bungling Home Office officials who were unaware he had been granted permission to stay in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Judge Nicholas Madge has now ruled that he must be paid a fortune in taxpayers' cash to compensate him for the extra time spent behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Madge admitted that many people would think Bah's traumatised victims deserved the big payout instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bah's trial was held at Central London County Court[/caption]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the judge said he was obliged to protect the principle that no one should be locked up without lawful authority in a civilised society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bah should never have been held in custody after his sentences expired because he had been granted refugee status, Central London County Court was told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, as the Guinea Embassy had refused to issue him with travel documents, there was never any prospect of deporting him anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bah, who arrived in the UK in 2007 to join his refugee father, was convicted of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl in February 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was jailed for 18 months and put on the sex offenders' register for 10 years but was jailed again, for two years, for another sexual assault in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Secretary signed a deportation order against him in December 2011, without realising he was entitled to be treated as a refugee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he was held in prison unlawfully for 14 months between January 2012 and March 2013 &quot;pending deportation&quot; and again between October 2014 and June 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given his refugee status and the attitude of the Guinea Embassy, there was never any prospect of him being thrown out of the country, Judge Madge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guinea authorities have consistently refused to issue travel papers to anyone who does not want to return to the country voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bah, from Southampton, Hants had not volunteered and the judge said that no one had been successfully deported to the West African state since 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both periods of immigration detention were therefore ruled unlawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Madge ruled Bah was entitled to justice, like anyone else, and it was the role of independent judges to hold the government to account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had served his punishments for his crimes and was only due compensation because of the Home Office's failure to apply its own policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge added that if the Home Officials had behaved in a competent manner, the need to award Bah damages would not have arisen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokeswoman said:&quot;People who have no right to live in this country should be in no doubt of our determination to remove them. We have removed more than 41,000 Foreign National Offenders since 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are now considering the judgement but this case does not change the legality of Mr Bah's status in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breaking its silence on suspicions that those within it had been radicalised, the Rohingya community on Tuesday claimed before the Supreme Court that they have no connection with any terrorist organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They contended that they were being targeted for deportation only because they were Muslims in a&nbsp;plea filed on behalf of approximately 7,000 Rohingya refugees residing in 23 settlements in Jammu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said: 'We have nothing to do with terrorism. Ever since we began residing in Jammu, there has been no such allegation against us. Not a single one of us has ever been engaged in any kind of terrorist activity.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The local police have for more than a year conducted interrogation of all the Rohingyas and have taken full details of each family. The local police have inspected our settlements several times every month.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'All the Rohingyas cooperate with the police and give them all required information. There is therefore not a single terrorist in our midst'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra postponed the plea for hearing until next Monday along with the one filed by noted lawyer Prashant Bhushan, challenging the move to deport the refugees back to Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingyas, in their petition, also said the Centre's move was against their right to equality as the community is being discriminated against when compared to the government's treatment of Tibetans and other refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have been singled out for very harsh treatment including deportation - which will surely result in our execution. This is being done because we are poor and we are Muslims. The Myanmarese government has adopted a straight-forward and blatantly racist stance with regard to us', they said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India has warned Myanmar that Pakistan-based militants like Lashkar-e-Taiba are radicalising members of the Rohingya community that posed a security risk to both the countries as well as the region.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said that according to available data, more than 14,000 Rohingyas, registered with the UNHCR, were staying in India and also that there were another 40,000 staying in the country illegally.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a communication to all states, the Union home ministry said that the rise of terrorism in the last few decades has become a serious concern for most nations, as illegal migrants are prone to getting recruited by terrorist organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fresh petition assumes significance in the wake of two intervention petitions in the case by former RSS ideologue KN Govindacharya and Chennai-based Indic Collective Trust through lawyer Suvidutt Sundaram seeking deportation of the Rohingya refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Govindacharya contended: 'It has also become known that al Qaeda is trying to use the Rohingya community for terror and jihad,' the trust has said their presence posed a 'social, economic and security' threat to India.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 19-year-old, whose family fled wartornSyriafive years ago, became an education campaigner at just 14 after she arrived at a refugee camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muzoon, who is friends with fellow campaigner Malala Yousafzai, toldChronicle Liveshe wants to become a voice for refugee children as she prepares to take her spot on one of the biggest stages in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump 'to quiz Theresa May over plight of Charlie Gard during G20 summit'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muzoon lived in the city of Daraa, in south-western Syria, with her three siblings and their father Rakan, who was a primary school teacher at a local school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the brutalconflictgrew worse the family fled in the dead of night and made their way to a refugee camp in Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the first day in the camp, Muzoon looked around the damp tents and makeshift buildings and asked her father: &quot;Where is the school?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years on, the family is now living in Newcastle upon Tyne, where Muzoon recently received an award from the Newcastle Peace and Unity group for her work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muzoon, who has been called the &quot;Malala of Syria&quot;, was appointed Goodwill Ambassador last month, just a few years after Unicef helped her at the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;I'm the first refugee to become a Goodwill Ambassador, it is a great thing I really appreciate it. It is a wonderful platform from which to fight for the right to education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a huge responsibility to speak on behalf of children around the world. I will do as much as I can to help them and be their voices and tell others about their difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want this appointment to be just a title of goodwill ambassador. I want to make a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British schools are suffering from 'considerable' and 'stubbornly persistent' racism, report claims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling the moment her life changed forever, Muzoon says her story began as the war broke out, turning the peaceful city she called home into a terrifying zone of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;We were forced to flee our home. The situation was really difficult and we were forced to flee and leave everything behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course I was sad, I didn't want to leave my home. I didn't want to leave everything behind, my friends, my relatives, my country where I was born and also my school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't want to leave and not be able to continue my education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she and her three younger siblings arrived at the camp, Muzoon was shocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no electricity, no water and having to live in a tent with all her family her life had changed beyond recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However she said her life changed when she realised there was a school at the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;That moment changed my life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I realised there are no challenges in the face of getting an education, because by getting an education I can change this hard situation and I can make a difference in my life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I got to the school I was shocked and saddened that there were so many girls there my age who didn't see school as a priority. I tried my best to encourage them and then I told myself to start my own mission and encourage people back to school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I started that in the classroom, anytime I met anyone I would tell them the importance or education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I became known as a voice for the children, an advocate. Education is a right for children all over the world. There are children suffering, and I want to be their voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three years of living in a refugee camp, Muzoon and her family were able to move to the UK and settled in the north east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muzoon has just left secondary school after spending one-and-a-half years there and is set to go to college in Newcastle in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muzoon has pledged never to give up her fight for education and has become friends withMalala Yousafzai,the youngest ever Nobel Peace prize winner who was shot by theTalibanwhen she was just 15-years-old because of her education awareness work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muzoon said: &quot;Malala shes a remarkable person, we became friends, her friendship is a pleasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I came here I didn't stop my activities, I still fight for the right to education and I will do that forever.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE teenager suspected of planting the Parsons Green tube bomb is a refugee from Iraq who came to the UK after his parents were killed, it was claimed last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCTV footage released yesterday shows a man with a Lidl bag like the one containing the bomb which exploded on the train, injuring 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With dark collarlength hair, in a maroon cap, he was pictured near the home of his foster parents at 6.50am, just 90 minutes before a fireball ripped through the packed carriage on Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The footage, obtained by ITV, was captured in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. Armed police evacuated neighbouring homes within 100 metres of the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sped to the property after an 18-year-old was arrested at 7.50am in Dover port on Saturday morning as he attempted to board a ferry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second suspect, from Syria, aged 21 is believed to have been fostered by the same couple. He was arrested at a takeaway near Heathrow Airport at midnight on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the first suspect had come to Britain as a 15-year-old after spending months attempting to smuggle himself into the UK, while living in the notorious makeshift Calais refugee camp known as The Jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee charity is believed to have helped his passage into Britain in 2014 and placed him in foster care with at least two families in Kent, before he moved in with another family in South West London in the past few weeks. Conservative leader of Spelthorne Borough Council Ian Harvey - whose ward is Sunbury East close to where the teenager had been living - said last night: &quot;One thing I understand is that he was an Iraqi refugee who came here aged 15. His parents died in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penelope and Ronald Jones, aged 71 and 88, who received MBEs from the Queen for services to children and families, took the Iraqi teen into thei home after a lifetime devoted to caring for vulnerable children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neighbours told yesterday how the couple - who have been foster parents for almost 40 years, for up to 300 children, including eight refugees - were &quot;at their wits' end&quot; with the teenager who had only been living with them for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect, who is being held in custody on suspicion of planting the homemade bucket bomb on the London Underground, is said to have had a furious bust-up with his foster parents two weeks ago after being brought back to the house in leafy Sunbury-upon-Thames in a marked police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area is just a 37-minute train ride from Wimbledon station, where the Tube that was bombed began its journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood he was picked up by police at Parsons Green station, where the bomb exploded, a fortnight ago before being escorted back to the Jones' home in a squad car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night a 21-year-old man, thought to be a Syrian refugee originally from Damascus, was also being interrogated in connection with Friday's attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-terror police seized him at a restaurant in Hounslow, West London, just before midnight on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed police raided his home, a modern mid-terrace house in nearby Stanwell, opposite the cargo bay at Heathrow Airport. Intelligence agencies are probing a theory that the pair could have been targeting the airport as well as the London transport network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed the second suspect - who has also not been named - was an asylum seeker who was also taken in by Mr and Mrs Jones after arriving in the UK from war-torn Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is thought to have come to Britain in 2015 and attended a local college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland Yard forensics officers wearing protective overalls, hoods and face masks were inside the Stanwell flat throughout yesterday. It is believed no explosive materials were found there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Griffiths, who lives across from Penny and Ron, told how police said the couple's home would be examined by forensics officers for &quot;at least a week&quot; after &quot;significant materials&quot; were found in the loft space above the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I think that while Penny and Ron have been away, the lads were in the loft taking bit by bit down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was only yesterday when they said the guy had been making bombs in there that I thought: 'What?' This is all just crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Builder Dave Solway, 44, who also lives opposite the elderly couple, told of a row between the 18-year-old suspect and Ron outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lad was out the front shouting and swearing at Ron, telling him he was leaving. I know the couple were at their wits' end, I think they were told he was a lot younger than he is which is why they agreed to take him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poor Ron was trying to get the lad to go in the house but he just kept saying he wanted to leave for London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe this has happened to such nice people, I really feel for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family friend Jim Adaway, 37, said the Joneses had only recently returned to foster caring to help resettle youngsters from overseas, after requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I think Penny was getting in touch with the council and telling them she couldn't handle the teenager as he was out of control. I don't know if they felt it was the right decision to start taking kids on again which is such a shame after everything they've done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other neighbours told how terror police recovered explosives from the Joneses' house. A mum - who identified herself as Carrie and lives on the evacuated road - said police told her they had found 15 firearms at the house and a bomb in the garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police refused to comment on speculation about what was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary Amber Rudd yesterday said the UK's threat level has been lowered from critical to severe. She added: &quot;It still means an attack is highly likely, so I would urge everybody to continue to be vigilant but not alarmed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the country's top counterterrorism officer, said police were gaining a &quot;greater understanding of the preparation of the device&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security services are trying to find how the Iraqi teen entered the country and who he had associated with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just one person was last night still being treated in hospital following the bomb attempt - for serious wounds to their lower body.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's &quot;push-backs&quot; of asylum seeker boats are illegal under international law and &quot;may intentionally put lives at risk,&quot; the United Nation's global expert on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, has said in a formal report to the UN general assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special rapporteur Agnes Callamard's report, Unlawful death of refugees and migrants, focuses on government responses to worldwide flows of migrants across borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callamard said around the world, governments were acting punitively and recklessly towards migrants. She identified &quot;multiple failures on the part of states to respect and protect refugees' and migrants' right to life, such as unlawful killings... and as a result of deterrence policies and practices which increase the risk of death&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callamard wrote that in a global environment where refugees and migrants were demonised, and the act of moving to another place criminalised, countries had designed migration policies based on deterrence, militarisation, and that tolerated the risk of migrant deaths as part of controlling entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Deterrence policies are punitive, including policies ranging from securing the more accessible border entry points - thereby purposefully funnelling the migration flows into more hazardous terrain - to the imposition of strict detention and return policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callamard highlighted cases where migrants are reportedly attacked and killed by government authorities, including in Libya, Mexico, Egypt, and the Sudan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island: dark chapter of Australian immigration poised to close</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Australia is singled out for criticism for its policy of forcibly intercepting asylum seeker boats and pushing them back to where they'd come from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Push-back' measures, in addition to violating the principle of 'non-refoulement', may also amount to excessive use of force whenever officials place refugees or migrants intentionally and knowingly in circumstances where they may be killed or their lives endangered because of the environment,&quot; Callamard wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This includes the 2013 policy of the government of Australia of intercepting boats to direct them back to the country from where the vessel departed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such practices raise serious concerns: they may intentionally put lives at risk, given that security officials know, but disregard, the reality that returnees may be victims of brutal crimes when returned under these circumstances. This may amount to excessive use of force by proxy; it is disproportionate and unnecessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callamard urged Australia, and other states, to find ways to protect their borders while also providing protection to those who need it, and upholding international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;States can effectively control their borders in a rights-based and protection-sensitive manner. This includes abiding by the principle of non-refoulement and international norms on the use of lethal force as well as the rights to life and bodily integrity in the implementation of border policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  French police 'use beatings, tear gas and confiscation' against Calais refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Since 2013, the government has reported turning back 771 asylum seekers on 31 boats from Australian territorial waters or land. The government says the policy acts as an effective deterrent to people seeking asylum by boat, and reducing the risk of deaths by drowning at sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since Operation Sovereign Borders commenced we have not had a drowning at sea in three years,&quot; immigration minister Peter Dutton said earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have destroyed the people smugglers' product. Their product was 'pay the money, hop on the boat, you'll settle in Australia'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've taken the sugar off the table. We've upturned the table and we've said to people that you aren't coming here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the policy has attracted significant criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government was accused of engaging in people-smuggling itself in 2015, when it paid $30,000USD to the captain and crew of an asylum seeker boat coming from Indonesia to turn it around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other asylum seekers have been put into lifeboats and directed to return to Indonesia. In some cases, these vessels have run out of petrol, and have been found, drifting, by fishing boats off the archipelago, or have foundered on rocks trying to make landfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2014, a group of 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers, intercepted by Australian authorities, were held at sea on a customs vessel for 29 days while Australia tried to take them back to India. India refused to accept them, and the asylum seekers were taken, first to Australia, and then to Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's process of &quot;on-water assessment&quot; of claims for refugee status has been consistently criticised by international law experts, who argue the perfunctory questioning, often involving interpreters on unreliable phone lines and without legal representation, is unfair and risks sending people home to danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More broadly, Australia has found itself under sustained criticism by various arms of the United Nations, as it has sought to promote itself globally as a defender of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia was elected to the UN Human Rights Council - in an uncontested &quot;clean slate&quot; ballot - this month, but the three year-term on the powerful body has brought with it a new level of global scrutiny on rights abuses in the country, particularly of refugees and asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Law Centre's director of legal advocacy, Daniel Webb, said there was a rising tide of global condemnation directed towards Australia over its mistreatment of refugees, and that refugee policy would overshadow and hamper all of its efforts on the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our government is just two weeks into a three-year term on the Human Rights Council and already it's clear that its cruelty to refugee will haunt it wherever it goes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For as long as our government continues to deliberately mistreat innocent people - people just seeking a chance at life in freedom and safety - Australia will lack credibility or moral authority on human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  EU 'running out of money' to stop migrants travelling from Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same week as Australia won its position on the New York-based Human Rights Council, the UN's Human Rights Committee, which sits in Geneva, excoriated Australia for ignoring its legal requirements to amend rights abuses and adhere to the international treaties it willingly signed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Yuval Shany, the committee's vice-chair, said it was unacceptable for Australia to routinely reject the committee's views, or &quot;self-judge&quot; international human rights treaties, telling Australia it could not pick and choose which laws it sought to follow and which rights it wanted to uphold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a week earlier, the regional representative for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Thomas Albrecht said Australia had responsibility to prevent the looming humanitarian emergency caused by its enforced closure of its Manus Island offshore detention centre while hundreds of men remained living there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having created the present crisis, to now abandon the same acutely vulnerable human beings would be unconscionable,&quot; Albrecht said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legally and morally, Australia cannot walk away from all those it has forcibly transferred to Papua New Guinea and Nauru.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's exhibition features a wheelchair that can climb stairs, a language-translating earpiece and a brand identity for Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More and more, design is becoming an all-encompassing term spanning everything from new products, TV animations, graphics and clothing to the way our buildings are put together and our streets are laid out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every year, the Design Museum does an apt job of making sense of this enormous term with its Beazley Designs of the Year exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now in its 10th year, the show presents a carefully curated selection of the year's best designs spanning six categories: architecture, digital, fashion, graphics, product and transport. The show comprises a shortlist, of which category winners and one overall winner will be chosen and revealed in January.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navigating the 2017 exhibition is significantly easier than last year's. The 62 shortlisted projects have been grouped into themes, making them more digestible, while architectural practice Carmody Groarke has designed a dystopian exhibition space in the basement of the museum, consisting of mountainous, grey sculptures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Made from a textured, recycled paper called Soundcel, the space is both tactile and peculiar, and the mounds separate out sections sufficiently. Exhibition graphics have been designed by Micha Weidmann Studio, and consist of brightly-coloured acrylic pieces that add some life to the cavernous, grey mounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's themes include: Innovators, &quot;risk-taking&quot; projects that are free from commercial constraint; Activists, projects that recognise and address current political and social issues; Brands, which are communication, graphic and brand design projects, mostly for clients; Makers, projects created through craft skills; and Builders, building projects created by architectural practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to a showcase of projects, this year also includes a five-minute film looking back on the last 10 years of the Beazley Designs of the Year Awards, where spokespeople including Design Museum director Dejan Sudjic talk about the merits and downfalls of previous winners. This includes 2016's overall winner, the Ikea Better Shelter, which is aimed at housing refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After strolling through the space, here are some of our favourite, shortlisted projects from this year's show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graphics: Wales Nation Brand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wales Nation Brand, by Sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord Studio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country of Wales took on a new brand identity in February this year, designed by Cardiff-based consultancy Sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord. The identity encompasses a red dragon symbol, akin to that seen on the national flag, and bespoke typeface Cymru Wales Sans, which takes typographic cues from the Welsh language. The studio's co-founder Dylan Griffith told Design Week at the time that the new identity was part of a drive to &quot;do the country justice&quot; and increase business, tourism and migration to Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some sterling graphics projects in this year's Designs of the Year, including Unit Editions' book design for a monograph on Paula Scher and the popular Me &amp; EU postcard campaign that came about following the Brexit vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite fierce competition, Sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord's branding project stands out as a well-thought-through and sensitive depiction of Wales and its culture. Its success is proven by the country's surge in popularity since its launch - a 30% increase in social media followers for tourism board Visit Wales, five million visits to its website and a feature in the Lonely Planet travel guide for 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transport: Scewo wheelchair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scewo wheelchair, by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is remarkable that Scewo - created by a group of designers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology - has not already been invented. One resounding problem for wheelchair users is the need for somebody else to help them when using public transport such as trains, due to inaccessible stations and abundance of stairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ingenious yet simple interpretation of a wheelchair includes a retractable set of rubber tracks, which would allow users to climb up and down stairs independently. An extra pair of wheels at the back of the chair also allows them to raise the chair up so that it meets other people at eye level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If proven safe to use up flights of stairs after testing, this could be a game-changer for wheelchair users, helping them to travel independently and communicate with able-bodied people confidently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Product: The Pilot translating earpiece</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pilot translating earpiece, by Waverly Labs. Digitally generated by Sergio Del Rio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">English is, without a doubt, one of the most prominently spoken languages across the world. Research conducted by The Telegraph this year found that there are 45 countries outside of the UK where at least half of the population speak it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comes with the merit that, when travelling, Brits have a high chance of being able to speak their native tongue abroad. However, it also means that there is a reluctance in the UK to learn other languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pilot translating earpiece, designed by Waverly Labs, translates between users speaking different languages. It consists of two earpieces, each worn by two users, and translates automatically as someone speaks into it. It currently works with 15 different languages, but can be updated with more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we should encourage learning and appreciation of other languages rather than resigning ourselves to an automatic translator, it cannot be denied that this could be a revolutionary piece of kit that could help ease communication between people of different cultures. Everything from international trade to airport border control could benefit from this invention, which was brought to life through a crowdfunding campaign that raised over $5 million (&pound;3.8 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digital: Refugee Text</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Refugee Text, by K&aring;re&nbsp;Magnus Sand&nbsp;Solv&aring;g, Caroline Arvidsson and Ciar&aacute;n Duffy, photo by Angel Garcia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's Designs of the Year winner, Ikea's Better Shelter, has helped house thousands of refugees and protect them from physical danger - but what tools are available to help them travel to safety in the first place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Text, designed by K&aring;re&nbsp;Magnus Sand&nbsp;Solv&aring;g, Caroline Arvidsson and Ciar&aacute;n Duffy, is a text message and online tool that aims to provide refugees with regular updates and information, tailored to their individual needs and journeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every refugee should have access to actionable information, but aid organisations are struggling to keep refugees informed,&quot; say the designers. &quot;They are unaware of where to get help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Text tackles this by linking up directly with aid organisations and charities, which provide the service with information updates. Any refugee with access to a phone can then text the service or use its website, and an automated chatbot will appear giving them the information they need immediately. It is available to use 24 hours a day, and does not need wifi to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the service can never replace a humanitarian aid organisation being present in the flesh, Refugee Text could be a go-to when migrants do not know where to turn. It also acts as a link between charities and travellers, helping them reach each other and communicate critical information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fashion: Pussyhat project</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pussyhat project, by The Little Knittery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pussyhat project, started by four women in a village in California, is an example of how a small piece of protest art can lead to mass movement and solidarity between thousands of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pussyhat is a pink, woolly, knitted hat, created by the Little Knittery in Atwater village, Los Angeles, as a form of protest against Donald Trump's presidency, and particularly his reported treatment of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was created for the Women's March that took place in Los Angeles in January 2017, which turned into a worldwide march. The group put an open-source knitting pattern online, as an invitation for other women to stand together and wear the same hat at the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has since turned into a global project, with thousands of women turning their hands to craft to signal their dissatisfaction with current politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knitting a hat cannot change the world but the project is a refreshing reminder of the impact that can be created by making art, craft and design accessible to the masses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Architecture: Warka Water</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Warka Water Tower, by Arturo Vittori</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of access to drinkable water is a shocking reality for much of the developing world, including small villages in Ethiopia, where the Warka Water project was first trialled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warka Water, conceptualised by Italian industrial designer and architect Arturo Vittori, is a large-scale project aimed at generating and transporting safe, drinking water to communities worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It consists of a vertical tower that collects and harvests water from the air, such as from rain, fog and dew, relying on natural processes such as gravity, condensation and evaporation to work. It also has a canopy, providing a shaded area for people to meet, study, work and relax, and contains solar panels that generate electricity from sunlight and allow communities to charge phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other parts of the project include a hygienic shelter and housing solution called Warka House, a water transportation system called Warka Drone, and a food harvesting tool called Warka Garden, which uses water collected to grow crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an ambitious one-stop-shop for communities in need of basic and critical needs such as shelter, water and food. Although it cannot claim to be an all-encompassing solution, it could be the basis for other similar projects in the future which could collectively make a big impact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French government has condemned the conduct of police in Normandy, following an independent inquiry that highlights how refugees have been victims of excessive use of tear gas and repeated destruction of personal property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year on from the demolition of the notorious Calais Jungle, as the number of displaced people in the area creeps up to an estimated 2,000, a body of new evidence seen exclusively by The Independent indicates that officers are threatening to split up families, tearing up refugees' tents and in some cases beating people with batons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other testimonies reveal refugees have been held for long periods of time in the local police station, with one family telling how they were detained for an entire day, during which time they were given no food or clean nappies for their young baby. Police have also been seen confiscating and sometimes destroying refugees' belongings, such as their phones or shoes. One video shows a male refugee on the ground with three police officers standing around him, one of whom appears to kick his mobile phone onto the road and knock it down a drain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes in the same week the French government condemned the &quot;abuse&quot; of tear gas and the &quot;destruction of migrants' personal belongings&quot; by police in the region after state investigators confirmed in a government-commissioned report that abuses were taking police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation, requested by the interior ministry in response to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) in July, found that police routinely use chemical sprays on refugees, including children, while they were sleeping and in other circumstances where they posed no threat. Officers also regularly spray or confiscate sleeping bags, blankets, and clothing, apparently to press people to leave the area, investigators found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new evidence of police abuses, gathered by Humans for Rights Network, confirms these abuses, and also highlights cases where police have forced sleeping children out of their tents and threatened to split up families, as well as in one case reportedly beating a male refugee to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Iraqi Kurdish woman told how one morning police came and opened the zip of the tent where her two- and four-year-old children were sleeping, ordering them to leave as soon as possible. &quot;There were a lot of police around, maybe 50 or 60. Some of them told me and my children to go by the lake where there were many other refugees,&quot; she said. &quot;We went there and we were all sat down in the middle of a circle of police with linked hands to trap us inside. An interpreter with the police said there was a decision from the government that if we don't go with them, they will separate families and send the husband to prison for two years. They said they would remove the children from their families. The families were very scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another case, three adults and an eight-month-old baby were hiding in the back of a lorry near Dunkirk overnight, before they were reported by the driver to police. Two officers opened the lorry doors and took the family to the police station, where they remained in a cell until around 5pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this time, the report states that the father of the baby requested a glass of water for his wife, which arrived three hours later. When the baby soiled her clothes the family asked the police to allow them to change her and put the dirty nappy outside the room. The police laughed and allowed them out over an hour later, and they did not provide the baby any clean nappies or clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adults received a small portion of rice each and one bottle of water between them but there was no food or milk provided for the baby for the whole day. Once all family members had been interviewed individually, they were released with no resources to help them travel back to the informal camp where they had been sleeping in Dunkirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, a 25-year-old woman in Calais told researchers she witnessed another woman of her age being sprayed with tear gas by police. &quot;There were two policemen surrounding her. She turned away from the one in front and the one behind sprayed her in the face,&quot; she said. &quot;They sprayed for a long time and then when she turned away the one in front of her sprayed her in the face also. After the second spray she fell over, when she got up they sprayed again. She ran for about 15 minutes but couldn't see anything. She fell into some water with all her clothes on and her phone in her pocket. The police followed her and when they saw her in the lake they got in the car and drove away. She shouted for help and some Eritrean men helped her to get out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 17-year-old girl, also living in Calais, said she had been sprayed with CS gas multiple times by police when discovered in lorries. She said she &quot;became blind&quot; the first time. When describing the last time she was sprayed, she said: &quot;My eyes, my throat and my nose were irritated. Still now my throat is a problem, the gas entered my stomach and I have problems with my stomach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One 35-year-old man, who wore a cast on his arm, told researchers that as he was walking to the food distribution point he was approached by police who beat him on the ground, leading to him breaking his arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fell down and they hit me on my arm. They then pushed my head into the ground. I was just coming to get food. They hit me two times on the arm. There were three police. They hit me with the big baton,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After they told me to go, my head was in pain and I had no strength. Three of my friends came and helped me to go to hospital. I had an x-ray and they said my arm was broken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddie Harris, who led the research, told The Independent the violence was &quot;constant&quot;, with many refugees having been victim to &quot;unprovoked extreme&quot; violence by police multiple times during their time in Calais or Dunkirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officers, particularly the riot police (Compagnies r&eacute;publicaines de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, CRS) appear to have no issue subjecting vulnerable migrants and asylum seekers, including unaccompanied children, to repeated exposure to tear gas, beatings and repeated destruction and confiscation of possessions such as sleeping bags, blankets, phones and shoes,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When giving testimony, most migrant and asylum seekers talk of multiple incidents where they have been the victim of unprovoked extreme violence at the hands of the police. One particular unaccompanied minor, when talking of an incident where he was beaten by the police, told me he had been gassed on three separate occasions in one day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have personally witnessed numerous evictions and confiscations of possessions, unprovoked beatings, violent arrests and use of tear gas. I have also seen the physical results of these actions, from young boys walking in the rain with no shoes, to the physical scars on the faces of unaccompanied minors. The officers in question act with complete impunity and show no signs of adhering to their code of conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the French government's condemnation of the police abuses, Michael Bochenek, senior counsel to the Children's Rights Division of HRW, said it was &quot;welcome&quot; that the state had acknowledged and condemned the issue, but warned that as winter approaches the &quot;pervasive policing&quot; must urgently stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The investigators received pretty consistent accounts the same as we and others documented, including things like tear-gassing kids in the face while they sleep, taking their sleeping bags,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's welcome to get that official acknowledgement that this problem is going on, and that they looked at the full range of concerns that we had. Now, particularly as the days grow shorter and the temperatures drop, people will have serious humanitarian needs and this kind of pervasive policing we've been seeing that gives rise to abusive practices must stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When confronted with the new allegations, the local authority for the Calais region did not respond to them directly, but referred to a previous statement stating that following the state-commissioned report the Minister of the Interior had ordered police chiefs in the region to remind officers of the regulations they must comply to, especially during dismantling operations of the unofficial camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wishes to renew his confidence in the police forces whose intervention is carried out in Calais and Dunkirk in a particularly difficult context,&quot; the local authority said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yahyah Farroukh, a 21-year-old refugee and former foster child, is registered as living at the address in Stanwell where police today conducted a search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His arrest comes after an 18-year-old wasarrested at 7.50am in Dover port on Saturday morningas he attempted to board a ferry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 18-year-old was fostered by Ron and Penny Jones in Sunbury-on-Thames before his arrest, as was Farroukh - though he has since left their home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbours confirmed Farroukh has been regularly seen at the Stanwell address just yards from Heathrow Airport.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The address is also close to Aladdins Fried Chicken in Hounslow, where a man was arrested by undercover police today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness who said they saw undercover police make the arrest in West London,told The Sun: &quot;The guy had just walked past the takeaway when three blokes and a woman came running past and he was rugby tackled to the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mates and I thought he was getting jumped. We were going to help him but they shouted 'undercover police' so we stepped back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Facebook, Farroukh says how he came to Europe from Egypt to Italy on a migrant boat in 2014, and currently works as a nightclub promoter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teenager arrested over London Tube bombing as UK terror alert remains critical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrested 18-year-old teenager is suspected of planting the Parsons Green tube bomb. He is a refugee from Iraq who came to the UK after his parents were killed, it was claimed tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCTV footage released tonight showed a man with a Lidl bag like the one containing the bomb which exploded on the train, injuring 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With dark collar-length hair, in a maroon cap, he was pictured near the foster couple's home at 6.50am, just 90 minutes before a fireball ripped through the packed carriage on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The footage, obtained by ITV, was captured near the property in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, raided by armed police who evacuated neighbouring homes within 100 metres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sped to the property after an 18-year-old was arrested at 7.50am in Dover port on Saturday morning as he attempted to board a ferry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood he had come to Britain aged 15 after he had spent months attempting to smuggle himself into the UK, while living in the notorious makeshift Calais refugee camp known as The Jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee charity is believed to have helped his passage into Britain in 2014 and placed him in foster care with at least two families in Kent, before he moved in with another family in South West London in the last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed police stepped up across Scotland in wake of Parsons Green terror attack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative leader of Spelthorne Borough Council Ian Harvey - whose ward is Sunbury East close to where the teenager had been living - said last night: &quot;One thing I understand is that he was an Iraqi refugee who came here aged 15. His parents died in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penelope and Ronald Jones, aged 71 and 88, who received MBEs from the Queen for services to children and families, took the Iraqi teen into their home after a lifetime devoted to caring for vulnerable children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neighbours told yesterday how the couple - who have been foster parents for almost 40 years, taking in up to 300 children, including eight refugees - were &quot;at their wits' end&quot; with the teenager who had only been living with them for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect, who is being held in custody on suspicion of planting the homemade bucket bomb on the London Underground, is said to have had a furious bust-up with his foster parents two weeks ago after he was brought back to the house in leafy Sunbury-upon-Thames in a marked police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area is just a 37-minute train ride from Wimbledon station, where the tube that was bombed began its journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood he was picked up by police at Parsons Green station two weeks ago - where the bomb exploded - before being escorted back to the Jones' home in a squad car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terror threat level increased from 'severe' to 'critical' with another attack expected soon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland Yard forensics officers wearing protective overalls, hoods and face masks were inside the Stanwell flat throughout yesterday. It is believed no explosive materials were found there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Griffiths, who lives across from Penny and Ron, told how police said the couple's home would be examined by forensics officers for &quot;at least a week&quot; after &quot;significant materials&quot; were found in the loft space above the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I think that while Penny and Ron have been away, the lads were in the loft taking bit by bit down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terror expert gives advice on how to protect yourself in tube bombing and calls for tighter security on the underground</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was only yesterday when they said the guy had been making bombs in there that I thought: 'What?' This is all just crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Builder Dave Solway, 44, who also lives opposite the elderly couple, told of a row between the 18-year-old suspect and Ron outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lad was out the front shouting and swearing at Ron, telling him he was leaving. I know the couple were at their wits' end, I think they were told he was a lot younger than he is which is why they agreed to take him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poor Ron was trying to get the lad to go in the house but he just kept saying he wanted to leave for London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe this has happened to such nice people, I really feel for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family friend Jim Adaway, 37, said the Joneses had only recently returned to foster caring to help resettle youngsters from overseas, after requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I think Penny was getting in touch with the council and telling them she couldn't handle the teenager as he was out of control. I don't know if they felt it was the right decision to start taking kids on again which is such a shame after everything they've done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">601 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A theatre group made up of young Syrian refugees invited to take part in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe is having to pull out because members cannot get the papers ensuring that they will be allowed to return to the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bureaucratic obstacles facing the group, whose organisers receive funding from the British Council, are a twist on the usual reason groups cannot visit Britain - visas being refused from fear that they will not leave again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also another symptom of the crisis facing Syria's five million refugees, who are increasingly unwelcome in neighbouring countries, especially Lebanon, where politicians are campaigning for them to be returned to their war-torn country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed El Attar, who is running the Arab Arts Focus strand at the Fringe, says the performance of The Elephant, Your Majesty!, a well-known Syrian play, originally due to take place at Edinburgh's New Town Theatre will be cancelled after the weekend if the paperwork issue in Lebanon is not solved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatre booking itself has already had to be pulled to save costs but another venue could be found if a last-minute reprieve is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are trying to find an alternative space but the deadline is Monday,&quot; Mr Attar said, adding that the group's problems were part of a series of crises faced in his attempts to bring Arab performances to Edinburgh. &quot;We are doing our best,&quot; he said. &quot;We aren't giving up. We come from a region which is difficult so we have to just carry on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatre group is sponsored by Action for Hope, an NGO that trains refugees in art, music and drama. It currently has six students at Lebanese universities courtesy of British Council grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The play, performed by 14 actors aged 13 to 25, has already appeared at theatres across Lebanon. The Elephant, Your Majesty! is a political satire on despotism from the 1960s, written by the best-known Syrian playwright of recent decades, Saadallah Wannous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actors have applied for British visas on their Syrian passports, but Action for Hope's director, Basma El Husseiny, said that the main problem was not getting to the UK but being sure the actors could leave again. She said that most parents would not allow their children to take part unless they could be assured they would be allowed back into Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon is home to an estimated 1.5 million refugees, more than a million of whom are registered with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. It has never granted them automatic residency, forcing them to apply for papers as if they were ordinary students or workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only an estimated 20 per cent of all refugees have successfully obtained the papers. In the theatre group's case, just four have succeeded, despite having applied five months ago. Even with the papers, it is not clear whether the actors would be allowed back in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't take the responsibility of taking them to Edinburgh and not bringing them back,&quot; said Ms Husseiny, who is an Egyptian citizen and has a British visa. &quot;I don't want to antagonise the Lebanese government, but the bureaucracy is very slow and the law is not clear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lebanese General Security office did not reply to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr Attar, who is from Egypt and travels on a French passport, the Lebanese group's residency issue is just one of a string of problems. Many of the performers he has booked, among them Egyptians, Palestinians, Syrians and others, have failed to obtain British visas despite Arab Arts Focus also being backed by the British Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a producer I would think twice about bringing Arab works to Edinburgh in future,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reviews by David Mills</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CULTURE; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">826 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have started popping up in European fiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Jenny Erpenbeck's Go, Went, Gone (Portobello &pound;14.99, translated by Susan Bernofsky) Richard, a recently retired classics professor, notices that large numbers of Africans are camping out in the middle of Berlin. Unable to relinquish academic habits, he sets out to interview them only to end up organising their protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clear, straightforward approach of the book is a change for Erpenbeck, whose previous novels (including The End of Days, which won the Independent Foreign Fiction award) rely on narrative disjunction and other modernist techniques, and often turn out, unsurprisingly for an East German writer, to be allegories of a country with troubling secrets in its past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might think, then, that she had some sort of agenda for a more popular audience with this novel, especially as, for an&nbsp;academic, Richard seems remarkably dim. The refugees have to explain Eid and the five pillars of Islam to him, and, looking at the straight lines on the map of Africa, &quot;for the first time in his life, the thought occurs to him that borders drawn by Europeans may have no relevance at all for Africans&quot;. There's lots of discussion about the way EU laws, especially the Dublin Regulation, trap refugees in a limbo of official nonexistence - readers will become quite expert on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is that Erpenbeck is so heavy-handed, smashing the reader over the head with unsubtle ironies. Richard contrasts his to-do list&nbsp;- &quot;Schedule repairman for dishwasher...&quot; - with what he imagines &quot;Rashid's&quot; would be:&nbsp;&quot;Broker a reconciliation between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria. Persuade Boko Haram to lay down their arms.&quot; This is a false contrast and a specious argument. I might as well draw up a to-do list for myself that goes: &quot;Sort out Brexit negotiations. Find housing for all homeless...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The novel is a liberal's wet dream. All the Africans are refugees from appalling conflicts and ethnic and religious repressions, none is a straightforward economic migrant. No one tries to scam Richard or cheat the system. (There is a minor, unsolved burglary, but you suspect it is there to test your prejudices.) Instead these noble souls are desperate to be put to work, and keen to read Dante in the original while they wait. Angela Merkel must love it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee experience is presented from the other side in Pajtim Statovci's My Cat Yugoslavia (Pushkin &pound;14.99, translated by David Hackston). A young, gay man of Albanian origin is living in Helsinki, bringing casual lovers home and getting close to his pet snake. Running in parallel with this is the story, beginning in 1980, of a teenage girl from a poor family in Kosovo getting married and starting a family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Yugoslavia collapses and&nbsp;ethnic violence breaks out, they flee and end up in Helsinki, and you realise&nbsp;this is the family of the&nbsp;young man we have already met. A human-size talking cat also appears and moves in with him for a while before they fall out (because the cat doesn't get into film school and he does).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This debut novel from the 27-year-old Statovci has been widely praised and won a Finnish literary award. It is not a thoroughgoing success: I&nbsp;could have done without the whole cat business, but there are very good passages, particularly when he is writing about life in Kosovo, describing rituals there that seem almost medieval, and when he grapples with the pain of the refugees living in exile. They don't fit in to the country they&nbsp;have moved to, and discover they have grown apart from the country they left, so that a comfortable return is not possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are condemned to lives of permanent dislocation. Given that Statovci was barely&nbsp;two years old when his&nbsp;family left Kosovo, it is an extraordinary achievement, and&nbsp;is all the better for his refugees, unlike Erpenbeck's, being allowed the dignity of being unlikeable, rather than merely objects of pity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigrants also appear, briefly but all too tellingly, in Peter Stamm's To the Back of&nbsp;Beyond (Granta &pound;12.99, translated by Michael Hofmann), as prostitutes in a tiny rural town in Switzerland. All are eastern European, a fact that is registered but significantly not thought worth remarking on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book begins as Thomas and Astrid and their two children return to Switzerland from their summer holiday in&nbsp;Spain. They are having a glass&nbsp;of wine in the garden, and when Astrid goes inside to check the children are in bed, Thomas gets up and walks off into the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stamm - shortlisted for the Man Booker International prize in 2013 - writes in his usual drained-of-drama style. Thomas becomes a homeless wanderer, while Astrid adjusts to life without him. There is never any discussion of Thomas's motivation, nor any obvious reason for his action, and the longer he stays away, the more mysterious and haunting it becomes. It is an austere work about how easily life can disintegrate, yet it also&nbsp;builds into an unexpected and moving love story.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 22-year-old was told he could be detained ahead of removal in June, despite having lived in the UK with his family for three years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee family's plea to stop UK deporting Palestinian-Syrian student</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after a campaign by relatives, lawyers, his local MP and MEP, the Home Office has now abandoned attempts to remove Yousef from the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter sent to his lawyers said the case &quot;no longer falls under the terms of the Dublin Regulation&quot;, meaning his asylum application will now be considered in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yousef's father threatened to throw himself under any vehicle used to take his son away when </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first reported on the case in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now Jehad Hassan is elated at the prospect of his son receiving full refugee status alongside his parents and sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I told Yousef the news he was so happy he couldn't talk,&quot; he told </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said 'dad, are you sure?'. I told him yes. His mother was crying and crying because she was so happy. Now all of us can be together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Yousef's situation remains precarious, with the Home Office still able to refuse his application for asylum when it considers the case within six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While awaiting its verdict, he has passed English and maths courses and is progressing to the next level, while his sister is studying chemical engineering and Mr Hassan is working as a delivery driver while gaining a computer science qualification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All my family is good for the UK, we are useful,&quot; the father said. &quot;We appreciate everyone who has helped us, I want to thank them all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the descendants of Palestinians who fled to Syria in the 1948 exodus, the Hassan family have always been classed as refugees, living in the Yarmouk camp in Damascus that was overrun by Isis in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yousef was just 15 when the Syrian civil war broke out, fleeing his home country after he reached the age of military conscription and was recruited by Bashar al-Assad's forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separated from his family in the chaos of the conflict, he journeyed to Europe alone and arrived in the UK in a lorry from Calais in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now reunited, the Hassan family are rebuilding their lives in Middlesbrough, where all members apart from Yousef have been granted refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he was too old to gain protection under family reunification laws, Yousef's entry to the UK was treated as illegal and the Home Office traced his arrival in Europe to where he was fingerprinted in Italy in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process gave Britain the means to deny responsibility for his asylum application using the EU's Dublin III Regulation, which allocates primary responsibility to the country of arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners have described the regulation as &quot;inherently unfair&quot;, both to refugees and frontline countries like Italy and Greece that are struggling to accommodate hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers that the rest of the EU refuses to resettle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yousef's representatives attempted to start a judicial review but the case was dismissed and the Government rejected a claim under the European Convention on Human Rights on the right to family life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter from the Home Office at the time claimed Yousef would be &quot;able to maintain a reasonable degree of contact with his family through such means as the telephone, email and letters&quot; from Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his family argued that he would end up on the streets in the country, where he does not speak Italian and had no contacts or means of supporting himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy McDonald, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough, wrote to Amber Rudd asking her to intervene in the case and said he was &quot;delighted&quot; at the outcome.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the U-turn came after Labour MEP Judith Kirton-Darling raised the case with Italian authorities, although the Home Office did not give a reason for its abrupt change of heart.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened to Samim Bigzad after the Home Office deported him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2,700 people signed a petition to stop Yousef's deportation that condemned the British asylum system as &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was started by Gary Spedding, a human rights campaigner supporting the family, who called the Home Office's reversal &quot;a small victory&quot; ahead of the final decision on granting the student asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today remains a cause for celebration, now the asylum claim will be assessed without the risk of Yousef being forcibly transferred,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The impending threat of him being returned to Italy or even possibly Syria is no longer looming like a menacing shadow over his family's heads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes after the Government drew international condemnation for deporting an Afghan asylum seeker to Kabul, despite him being threatened with beheading by the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High Court judges found the move was in &quot;prima facie contempt of court&quot; after ordering Samim Bigzad to be returned to the UK pending a judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations refugee agency today urged &quot;robust action&quot; to improve conditions on Greece's eastern Aegean islands, where the number of new refugee arrivals increased last month.<BR><BR>&quot;In August, there have been 3,695 sea arrivals compared to 2,249 in July,&quot; said Cecile Pouilly, spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), at a press briefing in Geneva.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While there has been progress to date, UNHCR is calling for robust action to improve conditions in reception facilities. We are also calling for the urgent deployment of additional national services staff, especially in the areas of health, psychosocial support and protection of unaccompanied children,&quot; she added.<BR><BR>According to UNHCR, the situation is most worrying on Lesvos, Chios, Samos and Leros, which have received the largest number of arrivals, including many children. More than half come from conflict-hit Syria and Iraq.<BR><BR>The full management of the response to the refugee situation on the islands is being transferred from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations to the Greek authorities.<BR><BR>Calling it &quot;a challenging period,&quot; Ms. Pouilly said that arrivals on Lesvos, Samos and Leros have outpaced the rate at which people are being authorized by the authorities to transfer to the mainland - further worsening already very challenging living conditions.<BR><BR>&quot;Estimated departures for the mainland last month were 2,561 against 3,695 arrivals, based on data from the authorities,&quot; she flagged.<BR><BR>In addition, conditions have affected the physical and mental health of many of the people who have been staying on the islands for months. The threat of violence, self-harm and sexual assault is extremely worrying and more security is needed, said the agency.<BR><BR>&quot;The situation is most critical in Samos,&quot; she said. &quot;Despite the recent transfer of some 640 people to the mainland from the island, more than 1,900 people remain crammed into an area meant for 700 at the Reception and Identification Centre (RIC) in Vathy. Among them there are more than 600 children - as well as pregnant women, serious medical cases and people with disabilities.&quot;<BR><BR>UNHCR voiced concern at the growing risks to their health and welfare, due to water shortages and poor hygienic conditions. The agency has been providing aid, such as blankets, mats, sleeping bags, hygiene kits, baby care and female dignity kits.<BR><BR>&quot;On Chios,&quot; Ms. Pouilly said, &quot;there were more than 500 arrivals in August. The Vial RIC has over 1,100 people, including over 100 people without proper accommodation. Most are staying in containers and some new arrivals are in 12 tents recently installed by UNHCR.&quot;<BR><BR>Some 180 people also remain at the municipality-run Souda site, which has long been earmarked for closure.<BR><BR>Speaking about Lesvos, she maintained that &quot;tension remains high at the Moria RIC, which has been twice rocked by riots in recent weeks in protest at the slow pace of registration and asylum processing for certain nationalities, as well as the crowded conditions.&quot;<BR><BR>In August, there were 1,052 arrivals on Lesvos, and over 700 in the first week of September. Lesvos hosts some 5,000 people.<BR><BR>Turning to Leros, Ms. Pouilly pointed out that &quot;more than 290 arrivals were recorded in August, and the number of people on the island stood on Friday at 649. This puts a strain on capacity in understaffed Government-run sites, including Lepida RIC.&quot;<BR><BR>UNHCR is helping the Greek Government to identify gaps in the transition period and continues providing targeted services in child protection, support to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, relief items, transportation, and interpretation with a recent grant from the European Commission.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1009 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you Mr President.<BR><BR>And I'd like to begin by thanking our briefers, and if I might particularly say to Special Representative Patten what a profound and incredibly moving testimony you have given this Council. And your final words that inaction must not be allowed to take place is vital for us all. I think you've brought to life a truly horrifying picture, so I commend you for that.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I'd like to thank Undersecretary-General Feltman for his update on the situation one month after this Council adopted an important Presidential Statement, which included calls for an end to the violence, a safe returns process, humanitarian access, and for the root causes of the crisis to be addressed. I am grateful to you for your continued engagement on this crisis. It is vital that the UN continues to remain engaged.<BR><BR>Because the stark reminder, if anyone needed it, that Special Representative Patten has given us is of the horrors that these Rohingya refugees have suffered, a stark reminder that this is first and foremost a human tragedy, and which this Council must keep its attention.<BR><BR>Over the past month, we have seen some initial steps in response to this Council's Presidential Statement, which we welcome.<BR><BR>In particular, the recent agreement concerning the voluntary repatriation of refugees, signed by the governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh on 23 November.<BR><BR>The Government of Myanmar's continued commitment to the Annan Commission recommendations and to the development of Rakhine State through the Union Enterprise mechanism are also worth highlighting. And we welcome the announcement of the new Advisory committee. We support initiatives that promise to build a better future for all communities in Rakhine, without discrimination and regardless of religion or ethnicity. The Commission's recommendations remain a particularly important blueprint for the future given their wide support.<BR><BR>However, Mr President, there remains much more to be done and it is right that the situation remains on our agenda.<BR><BR>I want to draw particular attention to the agreement concerning voluntary repatriation of refugees. Now, this is a step in the right direction, but today's conditions in the Rakhine state do not yet allow for the safe, voluntary, and dignified return of refugees to their homes that this Council called for last month.<BR><BR>1,000 to 3,000 people are still fleeing in fear from the Rakhine state into Bangladesh every week. There are continued reports of intercommunal tensions and arson attacks, as Undersecretary-General Feltman set out. As we have said many times before the violence and human rights violations must stop.<BR><BR>While we recognise the desire to move forward quickly, we can only support returns which are safe, voluntary and dignified. This will require independent, international monitoring to ensure the conditions are met.<BR><BR>The rights of the Rohingya must be respected by the Burmese Government, including freedom of movement and access to basic services and livelihoods. They must be allowed to return home, not to prolonged stays in IDP camps, and be given a pathway to citizenship.<BR><BR>The responsibility for making progress lies primarily with the government and security forces of Myanmar. And the actions they must take are already set out in the Presidential Statement agreed unanimously by this Council.<BR><BR>Mr President, let us recall that in that statement, this Council called for the UNHCR to be invited to be a full participant in the returns process. Myanmar recognises UNHCR's expertise but so far has resisted giving them the necessary role.<BR><BR>In that statement, we called for transparent investigations into allegations of serious human rights abuses and violations. Not just because those responsible must be held accountable, but also so that refugees have may have confidence in their eventual return. So far, all we have seen is a whitewash by the military.<BR><BR>In that statement, we called for full and unhindered access to Rakhine state for UN agencies, their humanitarian partners, and the media. But the government continues to severely limit access to Rakhine, making it impossible to deliver vital humanitarian assistance or verify the situation on the ground.<BR><BR>Mr President, the situation regrettably means that we must continue supporting refugees where they are right now.<BR><BR>The Government of Bangladesh, along with UN agencies and other humanitarian partners, continues to play a vital role, providing life-saving shelter and assistance. Unfortunately, it is likely that Bangladesh will need to play this role for longer than any of us would like.<BR><BR>It is critical, therefore, that longer-term plans are put in place to protect and provide for refugees in Bangladesh and internally displaced people in Rakhine state. And it is critical, too, that these plans are properly funded.<BR><BR>On top of an annual program of $ 210 million to Bangladesh, the UK has contributed $ 79 million to the UN's current Humanitarian Response Plan, providing life-saving assistance and protection to the refugees and Bangladeshi host communities. But the plan is still only partially funded and in any case, it runs out in February 2018. We encourage the international community to step up its contributions.<BR><BR>Mr President, I want to turn briefly before concluding to the Secretary-General's appointment of a Special Envoy. It will be an important, sensitive role, so we support the Secretary-General in deliberating over the appointment carefully. When he or she is appointed, we call on Myanmar to engage with them openly and in good faith.<BR><BR>Mr President, I said at the beginning that SRSG Patten's briefing was a stark reminder that this is a human tragedy that the Council must not turn its attention from. We cannot change the horrors, the crimes that have already been committed. But that is all the more reason, then, that this Council must remain engaged, must remain seized of the situation, and must be ready to take further action if necessary to ensure the protection, justice, and progress.<BR><BR>Thank you.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">920 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mariangela Palladino, Lecturer in Postcolonial Studies (Migration, Mobilities, Diaspora), Keele University.<BR><BR>'If they throw something, break their arm,' a police officer was overhead on video saying to anti-riot police on August 24 who were running after refugees and migrants near Rome's central train station. The migrants were gathering there after police violently removed a group who had been occupying the city's Piazza Indipendenza. Five days earlier, when around 800 Eritrean and Ethiopian migrants and refugees were forcibly evicted from a nearby squat on via Curtatone, some emptied out into the piazza with all their belongings and occupied it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unjustified and disproportionate state violence was exercised on these vulnerable people from dawn to dusk by the Italian police. They used tear gas, batons and water cannons to clear people from the square. It was a spectacle of violence and human misery: women crying out in protest were swept away by water cannons, children and elderly people wrapped in blankets had to run for safety.<BR><BR>Most of the 800 or so residents of the squat on via Curtatone were refugees. But there has been no safety for them, and no sanctuary for those who should be protected under international law. The authorities said the migrants had refused to accept alternative accommodation and pointed to the risk of cooking gas canisters they were using.<BR><BR>After the Piazza Indipendenza events, a mass protest took place in Rome on August 26, attended by over 5,000 people. A group of 40 elderly, sick and young refugees were subsequently permitted to return to the building for six months.<BR><BR>The violent manner of the original eviction was aimed at erasing the presence of migrants and refugees from the city centre: they apparently must disappear, become invisible in the name of public decorum and order. This is a war on migrants, on the poor, on the vulnerable, on those whose lives are precarious and disposable.<BR><BR>This eviction is part of several recent state interventions in Rome against refugees and migrants. In June, the city's mayor, Virginia Raggi, announced that the city was 'facing a new migrant emergency' and that it could not take new arrivals. This is a marked contrast to comments she made in December 2016 about the need to offer refugees human warmth in Rome.<BR><BR>As migration scholar Nando Sigona argued on The Conversation, this shift in approach was made within the context of pre-election political opportunism in Italy. The issue of migration is moving centre stage as parties look to woo voters.<BR><BR>From warmth to water cannons<BR><BR>The inhumane treatment and denial of most basic rights to those in Piazza Indipendenza is the fruit of emergency politics to address migration rather than of a continued approach to sanctuary. Democracies are treating their vulnerable with violence instead of protection and eviction instead of sanctuary. The mayor's idea of 'human warmth' has quickly morphed into water cannons.<BR><BR>Migrants are dying at sea and disappearing from visible public spaces because their presence poses uncomfortable questions about the human condition, and about Western democracies. This is not a migration crisis, it is a crisis of human values - and these events signal that democracy is ailing and failing.<BR><BR>American philosopher Judith Butler observes that we approach certain forms of violence with horror, and other forms of violence with acceptance. This schism in moral evaluations occurs because certain lives are regarded as liveable, worthy of protection and worthy fighting for. But other lives are seen as unworthy of protection, not quite lives, at the limits of humanity. They are disposable.<BR><BR>Moral disintegration<BR><BR>Across the world, people who live precarious lives at the margins of society and at the limit of humanity continue to be met with violence. In the words of the Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe, this is 'the normalisation of a social state of warfare' - when the social state is weakened and ultimately erased.<BR><BR>The failing democracies of the West are plunging into what the Jamaican cultural philosopher Stuart Hall called 'authoritarian populism', marking the end of the world as we know it. When asked about this social system and the fate of our species, the American philosopher Noam Chomsky replied that: 'It's terminal disaster. We have constructed a perfect storm.' Under these conditions, our moral compass has been readjusted and our humanity - in the sense of being humane - is compromised.<BR><BR>Resistance, like that staged by the residents of via Curtatone who occupied the piazza after their eviction, can claw back shreds of democracy, dignity and rights. But it is the dominant cultural norms which must be resisted, the very ones regulating and influencing society's biased moral response towards refugees and migrants. In the era of post-truths, when knowledge is overtly, unquestionably and routinely assailed, critical thinking is more crucial than ever to halt the moral disintegration of human kind.<BR><BR>The ConversationUnlike the cowardly, brute force which can break arms like lifeless sticks, knowledge and critical thinking can be used to stem the tide of oppressive powers. Challenging the inhumanity of police brutality and society's acceptance of it is a transformative, emancipatory form of resistance. As the American writer Toni Morrison put it, it is 'critical to refuse to succumb to [the world's] malevolence ... that is how civilisations heal.'<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headlines</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Quds -privately-owned, Jerusalem-based, pro-Fatah Palestinian newspaper:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- [Fatah Central Committee member Azzam] al-Ahmad: According to information we have on US delegation's visit, it lacks clear vision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Ayyam - Ramallah-based, pro-Fatah Palestinian newspaper:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- President [Mahmoud Abbas]-[Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan summit next week in Turkey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filastin Online - Website of Hamas-run, Gaza-based Filastin newspaper:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peace process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isam Shawer in Filastin Online says: &quot;While the PLO has no other option but to adhere to Oslo [Accord's] mirage, the resistance factions have multiple options. They have pressure cards which they can use against the Israeli enemy and international community. In contrast, the PLO's only option is to continue running after the mirage until it is destroyed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other topics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the inter-Palestinian split between Fatah and Hamas movements, Fayez Abu-Shammalah says: &quot;There should be a demand to Abbas to stop collecting taxes in Gaza because he refuses to take responsibility for it... If he rejects this, a national committee made up of the Palestinian factions should turn to the Arab League to ask for Gaza's part of the taxes and Arab assistance. The next step after that is to turn to the international community. In my opinion, Israel will welcome this separatist move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Al-Ayyam, Hani Habib discusses talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israel's Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu. The writer says: &quot;Israel can influence the Russian position [on Syria] with regard to its demand to contain Iran's role by threatening to carry out a military intervention to prevent it from expanding. This would once again escalate the confusion in the Syrian arena... Moscow could see this as a flagrant Israeli intervention and a pressure on the Russian interests&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial of Al-Quds discusses the situation in Ayn al-Hulweh refugee camp in Lebanon. The paper says: &quot;Ayn al-Hulweh refugee camp in Lebanon is witnessing bloody and destructive clashes that are increasing the Palestinian refugees' misery and bitterness... Regardless of the conditions or reasons, it is forbidden for the refugees to fight each other in a refugee camp in which life is closer to hell than to paradise. From Jerusalem, we urge all the parties to urgently and without any delay to stop this tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than three-quarters of child refugees trying to reach Europe are facing &quot;appalling&quot; levels of human rights abuses along the central Mediterranean route, a new study reveals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of nearly 1,600 child refugees aged 14-17 who came to Italy through the Mediterranean during the second half of 2016, 77 per cent reported direct experiences of abuse, exploitation and practices which may amount to human trafficking. Survey results from early 2017, based on the testimonies of some 22,000 refugees, indicate that the situation might be worsening - with 91 per cent of children reporting such experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, co-produced by Unicef, the International Office for Migration (IOM) and the UN Migration Agency, shows that children and young people on the move are nearly twice as likely to experience exploitation and trafficking than adults aged 25 years and above on the eastern Mediterranean route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One 17-year-old Nigerian girl reported being raped and held prisoner in a house in Tripoli, before being threatened once she sought help. An Afghan boy, 16, meanwhile reported being forced to work on a farm in Libya, where he was &quot;beaten with a cane&quot; if he stopped working, to pay his smugglers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children and youths travelling alone or over longer periods, as well as those possessing lower levels of education, were also found to be highly vulnerable to exploitation at the hands of traffickers and criminal groups over the course of their journeys. According to the report the central Mediterranean route is particularly dangerous, with most of the refugees passing through Libya, which remains riven with lawlessness, militias and criminality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes amid a surge in the number of youngsters pursuing routes to Europe in recent years, with at least 300,000 unaccompanied and separated children moving across borders having registered in 80 countries last year - a near fivefold increase from 66,000 in 2010-2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unaccompanied and separated children made up 92 per cent of all under-18s arriving in Italy via the central Mediterranean Sea passage from North Africa in 2016, and the figure remained at this level through the first two months of 2017 - up from 75 per cent the year before. Most of these children came from Eritrea, the Gambia, Nigeria, Egypt and Guinea. Ninety-two per cent of children who arrived in Italy in 2016 and the first two months of 2017 were unaccompanied - up from 75 per cent in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children indicated that they had been held against their will or forced to work - or had agreed to work for pay, and then were not paid. A smaller number told researchers they had been offered arranged marriage or cash for blood, organs or body parts. Smugglers may offer refugees, including children moving on their own, a &quot;pay as you go&quot; deal - asking for no money up front, but later demanding sums children may not be able to pay. Children may subsequently be forced to work off their &quot;debts&quot; under conditions akin to contemporary forms of slavery and under threats of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to researchers at a shelter in Italy, 16-year-old Aimamo, an unaccompanied child from the Gambia, described being forced into months of gruelling manual labour by traffickers following his arrival in Libya. &quot;If you try to run, they shoot you. If you stop working, they beat you. We were just like slaves. At the end of the day, they just lock you inside,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another youngster, 17-year-old Mary* from Nigeria, told of how she left her country to escape a life with no prospects, but found herself being sexually exploited at the hands of a man who had promised to help her.The man threatened to hand her over to someone else and leave her in Libya, then raped her. She was then held prisoner in a house in Tripoli with several other girls and young women, deprived of food and with no one to contact for help. &quot;I wanted to get away, but I couldn't - I had no money, no phone. I didn't even know where I was to escape,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karim, 16, from Afghanistan, ran out of money while on his way to Europe, so to fund his journey he spent eight months making T-shirts and pants for a textile manufacturer in Istanbul, Turkey. It was &quot;backbreaking work&quot;, the report states, requiring him to lift crates weighing 40-50 kg. He worked 14- to 15-hour days six days a week until he earned the 3,000 euros he needed to move on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings reveal there are racial trends in the exploitation of unaccompanied minors, with those originating from sub-Saharan Africa being considerably more at risk. Racism is likely a major underlying factor behind this discrepancy, according to researchers. Children from the region were more than four times more likely to experience exploitation and trafficking than those from other parts of the world along the Eastern Mediterranean route - at 65 per cent compared with 15 per cent. The discrepancy also exists along the central Mediterranean route, with 83 per cent of sub-Saharan African children subject to exploitation or trafficking, compared with 56 per cent of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report has prompted renewed calls for all concerned parties ??' countries of origin, transit and destination, the African Union, the EU, international and national organisations with support from the donor community - to prioritise a series of actions. These include establishing safe and regular pathways for children on the move, strengthening services to protect refugee children, finding alternatives to the detention of children on the move, working across borders to combat trafficking and exploitation, and combating xenophobia, racism and discrimination against all refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the findings, Afshan Khan, Unicef regional director and special coordinator for the Refugee and Migrant Crisis in Europe, urged EU leaders to establish protections for child refugees. &quot;The stark reality is that it is now standard practice that children moving through the Mediterranean are abused, trafficked, beaten and discriminated against,&quot; he said. &quot;EU leaders should put in place lasting solutions that include safe and legal migration pathways, establishing protection corridors and finding alternatives to the detention of migrant children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugenio Ambrosi, IOM's regional director for the EU, Norway and Switzerland, said: &quot;For people who leave their countries to escape violence, instability or poverty, the factors pushing them to migrate are severe and they make perilous journeys knowing that they may be forced to pay with their dignity, their wellbeing or even their lives. Without the establishment of more regular migration pathways, other measures will be relatively ineffective. We must also re-invigorate a rights-based approach to migration, improving mechanisms to identify and protect the most vulnerable throughout the migration process, regardless of their legal status.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lily Caprani, deputy executive director of Unicef UK, urged that Britain has a &quot;crucial&quot; role to play, saying: &quot;This is a global problem but the UK has a crucial role to play in preventing such dangerous and traumatising journeys in the first place. If we are serious about protecting these children, the UK must change its own family reunion rules so that children do not have to attempt to reach Europe to be reunited with loved ones. This simple move could save lives, and avoid children falling into the hand of traffickers and smugglers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration rules should be amended to allow refugee children fleeing war zones to be reunited with family members in the UK, a Tory former minister has urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Loughton MP (East Worthing and Shoreham) told ministers that the UK should adopt an EU scheme post-Brexit to ensure children do not have to make ``perilous journeys'' to be reunited with extended family.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Loughton said that without his amendment to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which brings aspects of the Dublin Convention into UK law, children would be ``forced to take dangerous journeys and put themselves at risk''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: ``Under current EU law an unaccompanied child can apply to be reunited with his or her close family in any other state that's a signatory of the Dublin Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``There is a disparity however between the UK's refugee family reunion rules and those Dublin III regulations because the UK's own rules enable refugee children to be reunited only with their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Whereas Dublin III allows unaccompanied asylum seeking children to be reunited with adult siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles as well as parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This discrepancy has left many children with little choice but to make the dangerous journey to Europe to reach safety with family in the UK.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Loughton told the Commons that he was encouraged with the ``sympathy'' expressed by Immigration Minister Timothy Raison to his amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: ``It's intended to build on the good work that the UK Government has done for so many thousand child refugees so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It would show that the United Kingdom after Brexit intends to continue to be a leading force for humanitarian good outside of the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This is a system that works, we need to make sure it continues to work after Brexit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit minister Steve Baker said the Government could not ``declare'' it would preserve the terms of the Dublin regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the debate: ``The Dublin regulation creates a two-way process requiring the co-operation of 31 other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We cannot declare that we are going to preserve its terms when we need the co-operation of other countries to make it work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We understand our moral responsibility towards those in need of international protection and that will not change as we leave the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We value co-operation with our European partners on asylum and want that co-operation to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``But the way to do this is through the negotiations, not through amendments, before we have been able to make progress in that regard.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intervening, Mr Loughton asked: ``Will he explain to me why it requires the co-operation and agreement of 31 other countries for the UK to be able to say that we will take genuine unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who have relatives legitimately in this country who happen not to be their parents?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Baker replied: ``I'm sorry that I have to tell him today I'm not in a position to take his amendment on that basis - we'll need to ask him to work with members of the Government towards the Immigration Bill containing the measures which he and the rest of us wish to see to ensure that we meet our humanitarian obligations.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by German newspaper Welt am Sonntag website on 27 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Interview with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel by Robin Alexander, Peter Huth, and Ulf Poschardt at Merkel's office at the Federal Chancellery in Berlin: &quot;Did you make mistakes in refugee policy, Ms. Merkel?&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chancellor pledges commitment to the car industry and diesel cars; she defends her refugee policy and explains why she does not conduct a coalition campaign. With four weeks to go until the Bundestag [Lower House of German Parliament] vote, she points out that the race is not over yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Passage omitted on interior design, furniture of Chancellor Merkel's office]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] You have led Germany through the financial crisis, the euro crisis, and most recently the refugee crisis as Federal Chancellor for 12 years. Now angry people shout at you at rallies in Saxon town squares. What does that feel like?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] We are a democracy. Everyone can express their opinion in public. It is important not to avoid certain places just because there are some noisy troublemakers there. By the way, in former election campaigns we were also sometimes confronted with fierce protests at campaign rallies, for example, at Roemerberg square in Frankfurt [in August 2013] -- at that time, from the far-left fringe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] In the interview with [the German women's magazine] Brigitte, you announced the &quot;marriage for all&quot;; in the interview with [the German weekly magazine] Superillu, you surprised the readers by speaking about a possible ban on combustion engines. Would you like to use this interview, perhaps, to call for a veggie day?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] At the event organized by Brigitte magazine, I replied to a question from the audience and pointed out that lawmakers should cast their ballot on the issue of same-sex marriage as a vote of conscience because I knew that there were different views on the matter, also among the MPs of the CDU/ CSU [Christian Democratic Union/ Christian Social Union] Group. This led to a very quick decision in the German Bundestag, which brought a long and emotional debate to a pacifying end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding combustion engines, I pointed out that we were planning to lower our CO2 [carbon dioxide] emissions by 80 to 95 per cent by 2050. This century should become the century of decarbonization. To achieve this, we need a dramatic reduction of emissions from traffic. In addition, alternative propulsion technologies, such as, for example, electric mobility and fuel cells, will gain importance. In other words, combustion engines are a bridge technology. I cannot give a date today how long we will still need this bridge, but in any case, it is a must to lower CO2 emissions significantly by the middle of this century compared to today's levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] But why should it make sense at all to ban combustion engines in Germany from a certain point of time? Many jobs depend on this sector, and no one knows how alternative technologies will develop in the coming decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] This is not going to happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, or in the next few years. But climate protection urges us to put our very ambitious CO2 reduction projects into practice, and this requires major changes in many sectors, including traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] It is not the first time that you grab a topic from the Alliance 90/ The Greens. Was this now necessary again, after the diesel scandal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] The CDU/ CSU is committed to these ambitious climate protection targets. In order to achieve these targets, in the long term, we need a different type of traffic and reductions, for example, also in building emissions. This is something else than discussing bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Nuclear phaseout, abolition of compulsory military service, increased offer of daycare facilities for children, open borders, &quot;marriage for all,&quot; and now the end to combustion engines ... have strategic considerations never played a role in this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] All these were decisions that had to do with a certain situation: the decision for nuclear phaseout was prompted by the big disaster at [the Japanese nuclear power plant of] Fukushima; the decision for the marriage for all was the result of social changes -- all these were situations to which we, as a people's party, had to respond. We will stick to positions that are sustainable. But if circumstances change, such as in the case of Fukushima, we may be required to adopt new approaches, and many people both inside and outside our party share this view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] You said that combustion engines were just considered as a bridge technology these days ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] ... the transport minister told me that this was the technical term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] So far, you have used this term only in the discussion on nuclear phaseout. For a long time, you argued that nuclear power was a bridge technology. But then, suddenly, the decision for nuclear phaseout was made very quickly. Could this happen also in the case of combustion engines, for example if even greater fraud by manufactures comes to light?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] I do not think so. We need diesel cars in order to meet the CO2 targets in the next few years. They have a considerable advantage over petrol vehicles. But we need to work on a reduction of NOX [nitrogen oxides] emissions from diesel cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] The car industry has been criticized very sharply in the past few weeks. However, despite all management wrongdoing, it is a German key industry. Should it be treated more leniently?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] No, it should not. And this does not contradict the fact that I am seeking a strong, future-oriented, innovative car industry in Germany. It has been under considerable innovation pressure for many years and, with good reason, invests more in research and development than any other sector. The pressure is so strong because it has to cope with various important challenges: the emissions of CO2, fine particles, and NOX must be reduced, digitization is advancing, autonomous driving is no longer a future vision. In addition, the attitude towards cars, in general, has changed. Just consider, for example, car-sharing models in urban areas. How will our industry respond to these developments? Will new actors take away market shares from us in the mobility market? Given the fact that 800,000 jobs are involved, I want the car industry to find ways into the future. For this, I am prepared to provide public support. The car industry is one of the major pillars of our Made in Germany brand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] In your election manifesto, the term &quot;refugees&quot; is first mentioned only on page 56 of the 75-page programme. Are you trying to conceal the most important topic of your chancellorship?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] The order of topics in our government programme does not reflect their importance. Refugee policy is important, of course, and I often discuss it. But if you ask me, what is the most important topic of my chancellorship, a sort of recurring theme, then for me, this is the task to shape our social market economy and adopt policies to create good and secure jobs also in times of globalization and to allow all people in Germany to benefit from the country's prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Did you make mistakes in refugee policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] I would take all the important decisions of the year 2015 the same way again. Just remember, by the end of August 2015, about 400,000 refugees had already arrived in Germany. In August, the Federal Interior Ministry predicted that the number would rise to about 800,000 by the end of the year. The actual figure was 890,000. In other words, the forecast was very precise. When speaking about mistakes and failures, then we should also discuss the fact that, in the previous years, we, including myself, relied too much on the Dublin system [regulation determining the EU member state responsible for examining an asylum application] in its current form, which overtaxed countries such as Italy and Greece. And we did not pay sufficient attention in the previous years to the fact that millions of people were in a terrible situation because of the war in Syria and the IS [Islamic State, or ISIS] terrorism in Iraq, that food rations in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon had been cut, and that many children there had not attended school over many years. The savings of all those who had fled Syria were used up, which created an emergency situation. The lesson that we have learned from this is that it is necessary to help locally, in the vicinity of the people's home countries, and to combat the causes of migration -- both in the environment of Syria and Iraq and with regard to African conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Would you really do everything exactly the same way you did in September 2015 and the following months?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] Yes, I would. At that time, in a very difficult situation, Germany did the right thing and acted in a humane manner. I am fully convinced of this, but I also say that what happened in the year 2015 should not be repeated. It was an emergency situation that we, and the people who were seeking refuge, should never experience again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Three weeks after the borders were opened ...?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] ... we did not open our borders. Germany's borders were open, and we decided not to close them ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] ... your government organized a crucial vote at the EU Interior Ministers Meeting to enforce the distribution of refugees throughout Europe. Looking back, do you think that this was a good idea? Or should there have been greater efforts to win public support for it in eastern Europe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] All EU countries should accept that the old Dublin system is not sustainable. It is unacceptable that Greece and Italy should carry the burden alone, just because they have the geographical location that they do, and the refugees land in them. Therefore, we need to distribute the refugees among the member countries in solidarity. Of course, we can take into account the countries' economic strength, their unemployment rate, and other factors. But it is not alright for some countries to refuse to take in any refugees at all. This refusal is unacceptable, and it is contrary to the European spirit. We will overcome the countries' opposition; this requires patience and stamina, but we will succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] In spring 2016, you were fiercely opposed to the closure of the Balkans route, which was finally organized by other Europeans. Would you admit, with hindsight, that this closure helped Germany, and perhaps also you personally, because, as a result, the numbers of refugees significantly declined?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] I have often said that the closure of the Balkans route in fact contributed to a significant decrease in the number of refugees arriving in Germany and Austria, this was evident. But it was certainly not a sustainable solution because, in February 2016, for example, more than 50,000 people landed in Greece and most of them were stranded there in extremely difficult humanitarian circumstances. It was not before the EU-Turkey deal was in place that all this changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Is that to say that you were not against the closure of the Balkans route?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] As already mentioned, I often said that this reduced the number of refugees arriving in Germany. But I also said that I was against uncoordinated national measures without involving Greece. At that time, the EU talks with Turkey were in the final stages. To me it was important not to cut off Greece from Europe and leave it alone with a large number of refugees. When considering the entire Schengen [EU's passport-free travel zone] area, in which Greece is a partner, the number of refugees clearly declined only after the deal between the EU and Turkey had been signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Would it have been possible without closing the Balkans route?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] We were on a very good path with the EU-Turkey deal. But things went as they did. Anything else is mere speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] You are known for being a very rational person. But as regards refugee policy, both critics and supporters assume that in September 2015 you let yourself be guided also by emotions. Is that true?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] As a human being, I listen to both my heart and my mind. At that time, at least, I already thought about it over the entire summer, and as early as in August I talked with EU Council President Donald Tusk about the need for an agreement with Turkey so as not to leave the sovereignty over the Aegean to criminal people smugglers. When I made my decision on 4 September I saw the fate of the people. At the same time, I knew about the situation in general because, as already mentioned, about 400,000 refugees had already arrived in Germany by then, in busses and trains, and just over two weeks earlier, the Federal Interior Ministry had revised its annual forecast upward to 800,000. Hence, at the beginning of September, it was a question of whether to let into our country also the people who Hungary suddenly no longer allowed to get on trains, who were deceived, and who therefore set out on foot in droves to get to Austria and Germany. It was a matter of preventing a humanitarian catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Do you think you should you have explained better why you decided that way at that time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] In an exceptional situation, I decided the way I thought was right in political and humanitarian terms. In the history of a country, exceptional situations can arise every once in a while. This is when a government leader must act, and this is what I did. The European Court of Justice recently ruled that this was covered by European Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Do you think that, after the war, Syrian and Iraqi refugees will return again to their home countries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] In Syria, I currently do not see conditions that would justify to say that the people should return again. I know that people from the neighbouring countries have already started to return -- even to Aleppo. But in general, the situation in Syria is still dramatic. We will see how the people decide. We provide financial support to people who voluntarily decide to return -- and quite a few people accept this offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Some people who have been accepted as refugees in Germany go on holiday in their countries of origin. Your state minister responsible for integration has defended that behaviour. Do you agree with her?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] I can imagine precarious family situations where it is understandable that people return for a few days. But taking holiday in a country in which you are being persecuted is not on. If that does happen, it can be a reason to re-examine the asylum decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Does it annoy you that your refugee policy has made the [far-right populist] AfD [Alternative for Germany] party big?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] Not all people agree with our refugee policy. I will continue to try to convince even the sceptics of the fact that it was and is right to respond appropriately to a great global challenge. We cannot duck away or seal our country off, but we need to combat the causes of migration, for example by means of partnerships with African countries and support for the local people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] How will the CDU/ CSU deal with the AfD in the parliament?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] First, let us wait for the outcome of the election. Irrespective of that, it is very clear, however, that the AfD cannot be a partner for us in any form of cooperation. But rather, we need to try to win back every single voter. This requires patience when addressing the people's worries and efforts to offer concrete solutions to their concrete problems. That is why we are intensively campaigning now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Currently, it is the Libyan coast guard, which is co-financed by the European Union, that forces ships back, which try to take migrants to Europe. Officially, your Federal Government criticizes these actions. Just like with the Balkans route, are you not once again criticizing someone here who is doing a dirty but necessary job?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] The opposite is true. In reality, we Europeans train officers of the Libyan coast guard and provide it with the necessary equipment to do its work. It should be enabled to protect the country's coast. Of course, we consider it to be of the greatest importance that the Libyan coast guard adheres to the rules of international law, both in dealing with refugees and migrants and with non-governmental organizations. If doubts arise in this regard, the reports will be investigated. A few days ago, I had discussions with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, and the director general of the International Organization for Migration, William Swing, in Berlin about measures to accommodate and care for the people taken back to Libya by the Libyan coast guard in accordance with international humanitarian standards. What applies to Turkey, applies to Libya as well. We must not allow the people smugglers, who are responsible for the death of so many people, to continue their business. We need to put a stop to their activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] After the attack on Berlin's Breitscheidplatz square [in December 2016] by a rejected asylum seeker, you announced a &quot;national effort&quot; to step up deportations. In reality, however, the number of deportations has even decreased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] This is true, and we cannot be satisfied with this. The numbers are down compared to the previous year because, at that time, many people were returned to the Western Balkans countries, with which we had signed repatriation agreements. Meanwhile, we have also made progress in talks with Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Egypt. But we do not yet have such agreements with very many countries of origin in Africa. It is difficult to repatriate people to these countries. In addition, until today, the red -- green [SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) -- Alliance 90/ The Greens] state governments have been reluctant to declare the countries of North Africa safe countries of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] [FDP (Free Democratic Party) Chairman] Christian Lindner announced plans to set up an inquiry committee to investigate the events of 15 September after the election. Has, by that, the FDP disqualified itself from becoming a potential coalition partner?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] I do not get into discussions about an inquiry committee on refugee policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Why is the FDP no longer the &quot;natural coalition partner&quot; of the CDU/ CSU as it has been for decades?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] There are many things that we have in common with the FDP, but there are also clear differences. As a matter of principle, I do not conduct a coalition campaign, but I am working to make the alliance of the CDU and the CSU as strong as possible. I will be glad if the FDP enters the Bundestag again, but, of course, the CDU/ CSU has no votes to give away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] There is great excitement in the Bundeswehr [German Armed Forces]. Officers and servicemen accuse the Federal Defence Minister of not standing by the forces, but acting like a prosecutor. Are the soldiers too thin-skinned?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] Federal Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen has repeatedly made it clear that the Bundeswehr and the people serving in it do a great job. At the same time, the minister has made it clear that it is necessary to address wrongdoing. If she had not done that, people would have accused her of sweeping problems under the table. Ursula von der Leyen does not only point out what is not part of the Bundeswehr's tradition but, in collaboration with others, she also considers what the Bundeswehr can do to strengthen its traditions. I think that this is right and important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Would you like Ms. von der Leyen to remain Defence Minister?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] We are facing a Bundestag election, in which the citizens are asked to vote. Hence, it goes without saying that I will not make any personnel decisions beforehand. But I will gladly say that Ursula von der Leyen is doing a very good job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] To observers, the campaign seems boring and the election already decided ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] ... I do not think so at all. The various parties have submitted very different concepts to the citizens. We, the CDU and CSU, focus on both earning and spending, whereas some of our competitors almost exclusively focus on spending. Besides, it is a fact that, in Germany, the outcome of elections remains unpredictable till the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] At events with citizens you are often asked questions about educational policy, police issues, or other problems that are not your responsibility but that of the regional authorities. Nevertheless, you are giving the impression that you could help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] Many people in fact think that a federal chancellor is responsible for most issues. They do not care much about the federal structure and the division of competences. They simply want the problems to be solved -- which I perfectly understand. Therefore, we have many meetings with the minister-presidents [state premiers] to discuss, for example, climate targets, the integration of refugees, and cooperation in the security sector. I have invited the municipalities that are affected the most by nitrogen pollution to the Federal Chancellery for a summit on 4 September. Strictly speaking, this topic is not the direct responsibility of a federal chancellor either. Nevertheless, the people expect the federal chancellor to deal also with their health worries and the possible fall in value of their diesel car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] A few months ago, you predicted that this election campaign would be completely different from all previous campaigns. You expected a tougher campaign. Has this turned out true?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] The election campaign is different from previous campaigns because, this time, the challenges are different. Moreover, it is different because it is more evident than ever to everyone that the SPD would immediately seize the opportunity of a red -- red -- green [SPD -- Left Party -- Greens] alliance if there were a majority for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Will your coalition partner not play a major role in the actual policy decision this time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] No, the overriding aim will be to make the CDU/ CSU as strong as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Will it not make a difference whether the government is composed of Black -- Green [CDU/ CSU -- Greens], Black -- Red [CDU/ CSU --SPD], or Black -- Yellow [CDU/ CSU -- FDP]?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] Of course, it does make a difference. Therefore, the strength of the CDU/ CSU will be all the more important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Welt am Sonntag] Three leading Federal Chancellery employees are in charge of organizing the CDU election campaign within the framework of a secondary employment. Do you think this is alright?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Merkel] To us it was and is very important, also in this election campaign, to clearly separate the officials' job at the Federal Chancellery from their activities for the CDU. The regulation requiring officials to notify secondary employment and seek approval for it provides the necessary transparency. We welcome the Federal Court of Auditors' plans to conduct an audit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF YOU have been harbouring a craving for one of baking biker Selasi Gbormittah's vanilla sponges since seeing him in the last series of the Great British Bake Off, you're in luck. The show's famously Zen contestant is auctioning off the chance to win a three-course meal with him - and he will join you at the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all in aid of international children's charity World Vision and its Share a Meal appeal to help vulnerable kids.He boasts that he is both a deft cook and good company - just make sure you save room for dessert.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gbormittah is working on the appeal after a trip to Uganda, where he met South Sudanese refugees. Cooking for them made the task of impressing the Bake Off judges seem like a breeze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To know a place and its people, Gbormittah believes &quot;you must try their food&quot;. He took on World Vision's challenge to cook a meal with Rose, a refugee from South Sudan, and the 17 kids she looks after. &quot;It was a massive task to make something tasty out of sorghum [a cereal plant] and beans, which is all the refugees have to eat, every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he could even start he had to find wood for the fire. &quot;Rose's kids and foster family found it hilarious, because South Sudanese men don't tend to get involved in cooking. Philip, one of her brood, kindly claimed my meal was tasty because of the way I'd fried the onions. But in the end it was more about sitting together and hearing their stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 600,000 child refugees now live in settlements in Uganda, many having fled their homes after their parents were killed or abducted in the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eva, aged 16, fled South Sudan with her sisters. &quot;They were on their way home from school when they heard gunshots and saw dead bodies in the road. People urged them to turn around and run back. They don't know what has happened to their parents. Eva now looks after her sisters Leyla, five, and Mary, 12, but they struggle. She finds it hard to make her rations last the month and they often go to bed hungry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Food is a common thread that connects us - wherever we come from,&quot; adds Gbormittah. &quot;Never has the importance of basic nutrition hit home so much. The monotony in their diet struck me, especially when - I'm ashamed to say - three days into the trip I bit into yet another sandwich and sighed. 'Cheese again!'&quot; If you're lucky enough to win the auction, Bake Off chat will be on the agenda. Gbormittah is watching this series and despite the new format finds it &quot;pretty much the same&quot;. He thinks Noel Fielding is funny, &quot;which is what the new bakers need&quot;, and predicts a girl will win: &quot;My money is on Sophie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His advice to the contestants? &quot;Stay calm and bake with the heart. You'll naturally feel nervous but don't worry, Paul is a softie and gives great hugs.&quot; A highlight was the &quot;Hollywood handshake&quot; he was given when his Yorkshire pudding passed muster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was hard not being able to tell his family and friends he was on the show. &quot;Some thought I was being unsociable because sometimes I couldn't meet up because of filming. I didn't get much time to practise before episodes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he has no regrets. &quot;Bake Off was a great experience, and I met an awesome bunch of guys. I applied because I baked a lot at work and for charity, and everyone kept saying I was good but you can never tell if you are. It was exciting to go on the show and try to prove myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1249 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Bangladeshi privately-owned, English-language newspaper The Daily Star on 3 October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar yesterday formally proposed taking back the Rohingyas sheltered in Bangladesh but offered no specifics on how the repatriation of such a massive refugee population should take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh, on the other hand, proposed a bilateral agreement to facilitate the repatriation process and handed over a draft of the proposed deal to a visiting minister of the neighbouring country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two sides also agreed to constitute a joint working group on the repatriation of Rohingyas but fixed no timeframe to complete its formation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali told reporters about these developments after his over-an-hour talks at the state guesthouse Padma with Kyaw Tint Swe, union minister for the Office of the State Counsellor of Myanmar.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are looking forward to a peaceful solution to the crisis,&quot; Mahmood said, adding that the working group will be formed soon. &quot;I am hopeful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talks came at a time when Bangladesh is struggling to cope with an unprecedented influx, termed by the UN one of the fastest growing refugee crises in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already 5,07,000 of the Myanmarese minorities crossed over into Bangladesh since late August to escape a military crackdown in Rakhine State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has denounced the brutal army campaign as a &quot;textbook case of ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar denies atrocities, saying security forces are fighting Rohingya &quot;terrorists&quot; who triggered the latest wave of violence with coordinated attacks on August 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Myanmar has made a proposal to take back the Rohingya refugees,&quot; the foreign minister told reporters. &quot;The two sides have agreed to a proposal to set up a joint working group to coordinate the repatriation process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reply to a question, he said the composition of the working group will be finalised soon, after both the countries submit names for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group will chalk out detailed repatriation plan through discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about a possible timeframe for the working group's formation, he said, &quot;We need to wait but let's start the discussion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyaw Tint Swe did not talk to the media and left the state guesthouse around 1:30pm [local time] after luncheon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Myanmar minister, who arrived here early yesterday, had no other engagement after the meeting. He was scheduled to leave early today by Thai Airways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alaam, PM's Principal Secretary Kamal Abdul Naser, Foreign Secretary Md Shahidul Haque and other high officials were present during the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Mahmood said he held &quot;very cordial and friendly&quot; talks with the representative of Myanmar's de facto leader and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have handed over a draft of the proposed deal to the Myanmar minister at the meeting,&quot; he said without going into details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic sources said the four-page document contained a detailed plan on how Myanmar can start repatriation of its displaced nationals now staying in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its note, Dhaka asked Myanmar to begin the repatriation within the next one month. It also suggested starting the repatriation with the registered refugees, who are already verified by the UNCHR, Myanmar and Bangladesh, and staying at Nayapara and Kutupalong camps under the 1993 agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three sides have unanimously cleared some 2,415 Rohingyas. Dhaka mentioned this at yesterday's meeting, suggesting that the repatriation should start with these people first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the latest influx beginning late August, Bangladesh was already hosting over three lakh Rohingyas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign minister in his six-minute briefing also said Home Minister Asaduzzaman will soon make a trip to Myanmar, which will help take forward the negotiations with that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been a fruitful discussion over border and security issues,&quot; he said, adding that some instruments on better border management are ready to get final shape during the visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the Myanmar minister was sincere about resolving the crisis, a senior official at the foreign ministry said he appeared fully aware of the situation and did not go for any arguments or countering the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign affairs experts in Dhaka saw yesterday's meeting as a positive development, but noted that Myanmar broke their promises in the past and showed non-cooperative attitude to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting sources said Dhaka called for an end to the current influx and persecutions of Rohingyas and implementation of Annan Commission's recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the Myanmar minister claimed there has been no military operation in Rakhine since September 5 and local administration has taken adequate measures to provide safety and security to the Rohingya population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About the ongoing influx, Kyaw Tint Swe admitted that he heard a few incidents about threats made by ethnic Rakhine community to Rohingyas to leave the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the deputy commissioner at Rakhine is visiting the affected areas and giving assurance about the security in place and urging the Rohingyas not to leave the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Myanmar minister complained that the Rohingyas who have crossed the border are making phone calls to Rakhine and encouraging fellow community members to come to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He asked the Bangladesh side to look into the matters seriously, meeting sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be mentioned that over 6,000 Rohingya people reportedly entered Bangladesh through Ulubunia point in Teknaf yesterday fearing fresh persecutions in Rakhine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the meeting, Dhaka also reiterated its zero tolerance position against terrorism, Minister Mahmood said, adding that he put emphasis on complete implementation of Annan Commission's recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Annan Commission presented its recommendations on August 24, calling for freedom of movement for all people in Rakhine and a review of the controversial 1982 law under which Rohingyas are denied citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Myanmar minister, in response, referred to Suu Kyi's address to her nation last month in which she said she was committed to implementation of Annan Commission's recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suu Kyi also said Myanmar was ready to start a verification process under the 1993 agreement with Bangladesh and &quot;refugees from this country will be accepted without any problem&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh was faced with influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar also in 1978 and 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1978, about 2,00,000 refugees crossed into Bangladesh to flee persecution by the Myanmarese army. The problem was resolved through diplomatic initiatives in sixteen months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between mid-1991 and mid-1992, an estimated 2,50,000 refugees took shelter in Bangladesh, but all the refugees except a few thousands were repatriated through a bilateral deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A memorandum of understanding was signed on May 12, 1993 between Bangladesh and Myanmar. It allowed UNHCR to have free access to all refugee camps in day time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another MoU was signed between Myanmar authorities and the UNHCR on November 5, 1993 to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of Myanmar nationals who were in UNHCR-assisted camps in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Myanmar government then pledged that the refugees will be allowed to return to their respective places of origin after necessary verifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar then also said that the returnees will enjoy the same freedom of movement as all other nationals in Rakhine in conformity with the existing laws and regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 17,000 attempts have been made by migrants  to sneak into the UK on trucks and trains in Calais this year, official figures reveal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information released by the French Interior Ministry show that thousands of people are attempting to enter the UK illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows the closure of the Jungle refugee camp in October last year, a move which backers claimed would reduce the number of attempts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday an Eritrean man died after falling from a lorry, reportedly having jumped off when he realised it was bound for Belgium and not the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French authorities believe there are around 350 migrants in the Calais area, but organisations distributing aid believe this figure is really around 1,000, RT reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News correspondent Mark Stone, who has been in Calais this week, wrote : 'The sole objective of the authorities here in Calais is to prevent a new camp from taking hold. And so, almost every night, they disrupt the migrants; sweeps of the woods are common.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch has accused riot police of using brutal methods to disrupt groups of refugees in Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure group released a report claiming adults and children were being pepper sprayed 'while they sleep' and pose no threat.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man who has twice been deported from the UK told Mr Stone: 'Why not in UK? We like it there. We can speak English, we can live our life better. So why not UK? I guarantee after one month, or two months, I will be there. If they kick me out, I will try again. I don't care.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last October the 'Jungle' refugee camp was razed to the ground having become a home for thousands of people risking their lives to cross the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were mostly resettled in other areas, but there have been recent reports that people are returning to the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, French authorities announced plans to dismantle a migrant camp built by humanitarian group MSF 30 miles north in Dunkirk, less than six months after clearing the camp at Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a French senate hearing, Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux said security forces would close the Grande-Synthe facility near the port of Dunkirk 'as soon as possible' after a series of violent clashes there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its wooden cabins, home to about 1,500 migrants and refugees, most of them Kurds, were opened in March 2016 by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) over the objections of the central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than a decade, France's northern coast has been a magnet for refugees and migrants trying to reach Britain, with French authorities repeatedly tearing down shantytowns in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After fleeing war or poverty, men, women and children gather near ports where they seek to break into trucks heading to Britain or pay smugglers to help them get across the Channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue is a constant source of friction between Britain and France and an embarrassment for the French government, which has been criticised by the United Nations refugee agency for failing to provide adequate accommodation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government believes camps encourage people to travel there, causing a major security problem, and urges migrants instead to register asylum applications in France and seek shelter in facilities elsewhere.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repeated break-ins around ports have caused delays to travellers and truck drivers, while local residents also complain about disruption and damage done to the image of their area.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Socialist government, which is determined to try to stop another camp from springing up in Calais, has criticised Britain for reneging on a deal to resettle hundreds of underage migrants from the camp.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is working with authorities in Bangladesh to urgently investigate high levels E.coli contamination in water drawn from wells inside the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar.<BR><BR>&quot;The latest figures from the World Health Organization suggest that 62 per cent of water available to households is contaminated,&quot; UNICEF spokesperson Christophe Boulierac told reporters Tuesday at the regular press briefing in Geneva.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also concerned by an increase in cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) which have included several deaths,&quot; he added.<BR><BR>Between 25 August and 11 November 2017, a total of 36,096 AWD cases were reported, -including 10 related deaths - 42 per cent, or 15,206, of which were children under age five.<BR><BR>&quot;We are seeing an upward trend in infection rates. Whilst the exact cause of increased cases of AWD remains uncertain, it may be linked to contaminated food or water, Mr. Boulierac elaborated.<BR><BR>Some of the wells inside the camps were dug too shallowly, less than 40 meters deep; have been poorly sited; and are very congested with no safeguards to prevent bacterial contamination at ground level.<BR><BR>&quot;Contamination may be being caused through poor hygiene practices, such as the use of dirty containers [and] bad hygiene habits of the population in water handling,&quot; the spokesperson said.<BR><BR>UNICEF and the Bangladesh authorities are investigating levels of contamination to ensure better construction practices for tube wells that meet international standards and have an appropriate ceiling.<BR><BR>&quot;We are stepping up measures to distribute water purification tablets to provide for water treatment at the household level as well as promoting good hygiene practices,&quot; he said, noting that providing safe drinking water has been one of UNICEF's highest priorities in responding to the Rohingya refugees' needs.<BR><BR>Smaller settlements at risk of being overlooked<BR><BR>Since 25 August, some 622,000 refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar have sought refuge in Cox's Bazar - bringing the total number of refugees there to an estimated 834,000.<BR><BR>As international attention focuses on the main Kutupalong and Balukhali settlements, the thousands who have settled in smaller villages in the southern part of the district risk being excluded from humanitarian aid programmes, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.<BR><BR>Access to clean water is also a major concern across all the locations, particularly as the dry season approaches. Aid agencies providing water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services are racing to identify solutions to this potentially life-threatening problem.<BR><BR>Although most are in the main settlements, 22,067 refugees live in Shamlapur, with 16 people sharing one latrine that are mostly full or dangerous; 22,130 in Leda, which has only one latrine per 47 people - well below the humanitarian 'Sphere' standard of one per 20 people; and 29,915 in Unchiprang, where there is also only one well per 57 people. This totals more 74,000 Rohingya refugees in all.<BR><BR>Many are contaminated with E.coli or are too shallow to provide enough clean water for the population through the dry season.<BR><BR>IOM emergency managers say that the three sites urgently need to be developed, including providing vital infrastructure - access roads, lighting and waste management.<BR><BR>&quot;Most of the temporary pit latrines are full. With little to no land for de-sludging, they are becoming unusable and a danger to communities living nearby,&quot; said IOM WASH specialist Stephen Waswa Otieno.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is promising thousands of dollars to Rohingya refugees who agree to return to Myanmar, a country that has been accused of ethnic cleansing against the Muslim minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum seekers in the Australian-run detention centre on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, have been pressured by officials to return to their home countries, even if they face violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papua New Guinea's supreme court last year ruled the centre for around 800 people breached human rights, was illegal and must close. Australia has since ratcheted up efforts to clear the centre, offering up to A$25,000 to refugees agreeing to go home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returning Rohingya to their country could put their lives at risk. Myanmar does not recognise the ethnic minority and has conducted military operations in Rohingya villages that the United Nations' top human rights official branded &quot;a textbook example of ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Myanmar: footage reveals scorched-earth campaign against Rohingya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close to 400,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, many with bullet wounds and stories of mass killings, as their villages burn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian understands up to seven Rohingya may be facing return from Manus Island and spoke to two refugees in PNG who said they were going back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yahya Tabani, a 32-year-old Rohingya man who arrived in Australia in 2013 but was sent to Manus Island, said he had no choice but to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to stay in PNG,&quot; said Tabani, who used to sell mobile accessories. &quot;I don't want to die in PNG. I prefer to die in Myanmar. Probably Buddhist people are going to kill me as soon as I arrive in Myanmar ... Australia doesn't care if we live or we die.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had been promised A$25,000 by the Australian Border Force. He had not yet received any money and does not have a bank account into which it can be paid. Tabani was waiting in the PNG capital Port Moresby for his travel documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no right to get citizenship and can't go to school. I didn't get any basic rights. Immigration [the Australian immigration department] said I have to live in PNG or go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had been attacked by locals in PNG, who he claims killed another detainee, an Iranian man. They were looking for money, he said. Physical and sexual abuse has been reported on Manus, one asylum seeker was murdered by guards, while others have died from medical neglect and local residents and soldiers have stormed the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Rohingya refugee, currently held in Port Moresby ahead of a slated return to Myanmar, spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity for fear of recriminations against himself and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am going back because my family are being persecuted by the Myanmar government. My family are in a violent place. I need to save them and look after them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had been arrested in Myanmar previously, and feared further persecution upon return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the reason why I leave PNG is there is too much torturing, they treat us as prisoners and they kill us mentally. That is more scary for me, that's what I decided to go back. Better is leaving PNG, I can see my parents before Australia and PNG authorities make me a fool mentally, or killed physically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian and PNG governments have vowed the Manus detention centre will be completely shut down by 31 October. Officials have been withdrawing basic services in different sections to force people out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island: judge approves $70m compensation for detainees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be unthinkable to send any Rohingya back to Myanmar - in the midst of the military's ethnic cleansing campaign against them,&quot; said Elaine Pearson, Australia director at Human Rights Watch. &quot;Sending them home right now would be a death sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the move &quot;speaks volumes about the dangerous conditions and hopelessness that refugees on Manus have had to endure, that Rohingya refugees would even contemplate going back in... the midst of an ethnic cleansing campaign&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration agreed to consider resettling in the US up 1,250 men, woman and children refugees sent by Australia to Manus Island and Nauru. But Donald Trump described the agreement as a &quot; dumb deal &quot; and in his first phone call with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, asked: &quot;Why have you not let them into your society?... Maybe you should let them out of prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the offshore detention islands, faith in the American agreement is fading. The US is not obliged to take a single refugee under the deal, only to consider them for resettlement, and 10 months after the deal was struck, no one has been accepted to go to the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canberra the Australian government has resolutely maintained no one detained on Manus or Nauru will ever be resettled in Australia. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection referred questions to the government of Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, when the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, was asked if Australia would consider taking any Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar, she said Australia wanted them to return to their country if possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from New York, where she has been attending United Nations meetings, she said Australia was providing a further $15m in humanitarian support to ease the crisis, particularly to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to see a ceasefire, an end to the violence, and then for the Rohingyas to be able to return to Rakhine state,&quot; she told the ABC's AM program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was the collective view around the table of ministers, that we wanted to see the Rohingyas return to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I'm afraid there's going to be considerable discussion here about the best way to achieve that. But nevertheless, the international community appeared to be united in its concerns to ensure that Rakhine state is stabilised and we can bring peace and security to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE competition among United Nations officials to make the most irritating comment about the UK continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the UN human rights expert who said sexism was more pervasive here than in any other country she had visited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the UN Special Representative for International Migration described British plans to build a wall around the port of Calais as &quot;inhumane&quot;. Now we have Volker T&uuml;rk, of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, vying hard for first prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Mr T&uuml;rk said the UK needs to &quot;step up&quot; and help to address the migrant crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never mind that we have committed hundreds of millions to help refugees in the camps around Syria, or that in 2016 we resettled more refugees than any other country in the European Union, the panjandrum decrees that we should double the number of refugees we take in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He criticised UK politicians for &quot;irresponsible&quot; rhetoric, called for &quot;more understanding&quot; and asked for everyone who works in this area to listen to the &quot;voice of reason within&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Mr T&uuml;rk and his ilk who are ignoring reason and who have been catastrophically irresponsible in stoking mass migration. It is time their approach is roundly rejected. We do not need more &quot;understanding&quot; or one more heave on refugee numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The migrant crisis of the past few years has been a lesson in the dangers of allowing heart to overrule head. From Angela Merkel's &quot;refugees welcome&quot; policy to the NGO boats searching the Mediterranean for migrants to rescue, short-term compassion has escalated the crisis, strengthening the magnet that draws millions to Europe from developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may see fewer pictures of packed boats on our screens these days but the numbers are growing. More than 83,000 migrants arrived in southern Italy in the first half of this year, up 19 per cent on the first six months of last year. More than 2,300 have died on the crossing in 2017. As The Sun reported yesterday, in Calais a new Jungle camp is forming, with about 1,000 migrants sleeping rough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The line between refugees and economic migrants is increasingly blurred. The top three home nations of those arriving in Italy in the first quarter of this year were Nigeria, Bangladesh and Guinea. UN figures suggest that seven in ten who have come to Libya are escaping poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, when the UK took in 750 children or young people from the Jungle, fewer than ten were from Syria. From Senegal to Bangladesh, millions have their sights set on a life in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antonio Tajani, President of the European Parliament, recently warned of an &quot;exodus of biblical proportions if we don't confront the problem&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which of our leaders will dare to say it - that this surge from poorer nations must be stopped more forcibly? That for the sake of Europe and the developing world a much harder line must be drawn in the sand between them? Most will sympathise with those who yearn to escape poverty, especially when the internet has pressed their noses to the window of the prosperous West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But behind every one who makes it to Italy are many more who will be emboldened to set out on the same journey. The potential numbers are dizzying. An acceleration of the current crisis would be a disaster not only for the West but for the developing nations who would lose a swathe of young, fit, enterprising citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long-term, the most benevolent and sensible strategy is to improve life in the poorest countries and so weaken the desire to migrate. But tackling this &quot;push factor&quot; will be the work of decades. There are two &quot;pull factors&quot; that must be addressed urgently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is the knowledge that once rescued in the central Med, passage to mainland Europe is assured. The people traffickers' ploy is to deliver the migrants not to Italy, but just past Libya's territorial waters so they can be rescued by the NGO ships beyond. Though motivated by noble instincts, the charities patrolling these waters are effectively aiding the traffickers, and they must be stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italians are beleaguered and need more international support to work with the Libyan coastguard to return the boats to Libyan ports. As Bill Gates (not a noted hardliner) has said: &quot;Europe must make it more difficult for Africans to reach the continent via the current transit routes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning back the boats might not be a palatable proposal shortterm but until and unless the central Mediterranean is viewed as a route of no hope, the numbers will increase, along with the profits of the people traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second great pull factor is the UN's woefully out-of-date Refugee Convention. Its definition of an asylum-seeker as anyone with a &quot;well-founded fear of persecution in their own country&quot; is elastic enough, with a little imagination, to cover many millions of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was developed before smartphones let those in the developing world learn their rights under international law. If simply stepping on to the hallowed ground of the West will earn you a hearing and a decent chance of staying, you will do anything to reach that land. Only if western countries reform the convention, radically tightening the definition of persecution, do we have a hope Libyan hoping into of controlling the www.crisis.No doubt various UN officials would say such actions lack compassion. The alternative is dragging out this disaster, drawing more to endanger their lives, enriching the people smugglers, overwhelming European nations and hardening hearts against genuine asylum-seekers. That does not sound much like compassion to me.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash has never held, never laid eyes on, his infant daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he fears he may never know her, and may be forced to choose between his child and ever being free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash, an Iranian refugee, is currently held on Australia's offshore detention island of Nauru. His wife was brought from the island to Australia for health reasons when she was pregnant more than a year ago. His daughter was born in Sydney in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     While the first of the refugees accepted for resettlement in the United States are preparing to leave Nauru within days, Arash faces an indefinite future on the island. And, he says, an impossible choice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island refugees could leave next week for US resettlement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he is currently separated from his wife and child, Arash has been told by the Australian Border Force he can apply for US resettlement, but not with his family. He must relinquish all custody of his daughter, border force officials have said. They have sent him a &quot;release of custody&quot; form. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ABF said to me officially you have two options: bring your family to Nauru and you can go  through the [US resettlement application] process  as a family; or your wife and daughter can stay in Australia but you have to give custody of your child to your wife and you will be processed as a single man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My innocent baby: there is no future for her in this hell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Arash    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never held my daughter, never looked at her with my own eyes,&quot; Arash told the Guardian. &quot;I was not allowed to be with my wife for our child's birth, and now they are saying to me 'you must abandon your family'. And they do it just to be cruel, just to cause pain to me and my family. To be heartless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash says his wife cannot return to Nauru because of ongoing concerns over her physical and psychological health. And he says he would not contemplate bringing his daughter - who has never left Australia - to Nauru for a chance at a US resettlement offer that, for his family, might never eventuate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My wife cannot come back because of a lack of medical support. And my innocent baby: there is no future for her in this hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the ramifications of Australia's hardline asylum policies has been the deliberate separation of families, sometimes for years. Now, with the imminent closure of the Manus Island operation and confirmation that refugees will never be able to settle permanently in Nauru, there is the potential that families might be cleaved forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian understands at least seven parents are separated from their children between Nauru and Australia, as family members are brought to Australia for medical treatment while spouses and parents are left behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash arrived in Australia from Iran in 2013, fleeing religious persecution because of his Baha'i faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was at sea when the then Rudd Labor government imposed the rule that no boat arrivals would ever settle in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I really don't know what is my crime to take all this torture and punishment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Arash    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash, a qualified computer network engineer, presented with demonstrable evidence of having been tortured in his home country, and was recognised as a refugee - that is he had a well-founded fear of persecution in his homeland and could not be returned there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 2016, Arash married a Somalian refugee in a modest ceremony at a friend's house on Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wedding on the island was attended by more than 50 people, officially recognised, and acknowledged by border force officials on Nauru. Arash and Mariam (a pseudonym used in this piece to protect her identity) have a marriage certificate and lived as man and wife in their home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mariam soon fell pregnant with their first child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Mariam's pregnancy progressed, doctors identified significant health risks for mother and baby, far beyond the capabilities of Nauru's lone, rudimentary hospital. In August 2016, Mariam was flown to Sydney, where she safely delivered their healthy daughter in March this year. Mariam and her daughter remain in the family compound of the Villawood detention centre, in what's classified as community detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash, despite repeated requests, has never been allowed to see his daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is my first baby in all my life and I was waiting to see this special moment but the Australian government ruined it and they can't return that moment,&quot; he tells the Guardian from Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'The man who loves ducks': the refugee saving animals on Manus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been through a lot of torture by my government and after that Australian government give me more problems and pain. If we died in the ocean was better than be in this situation and they kill us every second mentally and physically. I really don't know what is my crime to take all this torture and punishment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash's latest rejection came from the ABF in July: &quot;As previously advised, transfers offshore are determined on a case-by-case basis and this includes accompanying family members. We again confirm that your request to join your family has not been approved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash's time on Australia's offshore detention island has been, like the experience of many, turbulent. Currently, he has a job on the island, working for one of the settlement organisations, and his refugee status means it is illegal for either the Australian or Nauruan government to forcibly return him to Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he has been abused, beaten and robbed on Nauru (his complaint to the police did not result in any arrests) and his physical and mental health has suffered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has previously required psychiatric hospitalisation in Australia and reports from health provider IHMS state he has suffered severe depression and anxiety as a result of being separated from his family. He has attempted suicide on several occasions and has also suffered seizures and, at one stage, paralysis to one side of his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In returning Arash to Nauru, the ABF acted against the express recommendation of a psychiatrist, who said it would harm him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is my opinion that it would not be appropriate to return Arash ... to Nauru as there is a high likelihood his mental condition will further deteriorate,&quot; the doctor's report states. &quot;I am particularly concerned about the intensity of his suicidal ideation and the possibility that he may act on this impulse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash knows there is no future for him, or his family in Nauru, a sentiment confirmed by the Nauruan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of Nauru, Baron Waqa, told the Pacific Islands Forum this month that refugees could not stay permanently on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would love to see them find a home, and they will, and they will. They can't stay on Nauru forever, we've made that clear right from the start,&quot; Waqa said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immediately apparent option for Arash is to seek resettlement in the US, under the controversial people-swap arrangement agreed to between Malcolm Turnbull and then US president Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The first 54 refugees from Manus and Nauru were accepted for resettlement in the US this week. More resettlements are expected, but it is not known how many, or when they might move. More than 1,600 refugees across both islands have applied for US resettlement - an &quot;upper limit&quot; of 1,250 places was publicly stated by the US - but the final number may be significantly below that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash says he cannot contemplate applying to the US if it means abandoning his family. He says he wants only to meet his baby daughter, and for his family to be given the chance to live in freedom and in peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family unity is a fundamental principle of international and Australian domestic law. Australia is a party to the convention on the rights of the child, which states that children have a right to know and be cared for by their parents, and should grow up in a family environment wherever possible. It is also a party to the international covenant on civil and political rights, which says the family &quot;is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to questions about family separation and Arash's specific circumstances, a spokeswoman for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection directed the Guardian to evidence given by department secretary Mike Pezzullo to Senate estimates this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under questioning about whether refugees brought to Australia for medical treatment would need to return to an offshore island in order to be considered for resettlement in the US, Pezzullo said, in general, they would.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Persons who have been transferred back to Australia have been transferred for specific purposes - that is to say, medical treatment - once that ... has been effected, the expectation ... is that those persons will return to the regional processing location from whence they came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point of your question, I think, is: if they are then considered eligible for the US program, why would they have to transit back through either Nauru or Manus? Generally speaking, people would be expected to do that, but each case is of course considered on its merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the general expectation is that they would return to their regional processing location, if there is a particular vulnerability, or for compassionate reasons, I can see there could be a circumstance where the minister or the minister's delegate might allow them to come to a different view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arash says he faces an invidious choice, and the very real possibility he might never be allowed to see his child. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like I am being held hostage, and for no reason, this is all just a nonsense. I see my baby on my phone, and I miss her every day. I need to hold my baby, I need to hug her. They have kept us apart for no reason, only to be cruel.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Merkel has said harsher measures should be taken against asylum seekers if they take a holiday in their country of origin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes after she insisted she had no regrets about her response to the migrant crisis of 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Taking holidays in the country in which you are being persecuted is not on,' she said in an interview with Welt am Sonntag, adding that it could be a reason to re-examine an asylum case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is no official data on asylum seekers going back to their home countries on 'holiday', the issue has been a hot topic in Germany.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspaper 'Die Welt' first reported last year that it had found cases of recognised asylum seekers who had gone back to countries such as Syria and Afghanistan for a short time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Retsch, from the UN Refugee Agency, said the practice was not 'widespread'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the issue surrounding migrants continues to dominate the upcoming election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview yesterday, discussing her response to the refugee crisis, the Chancellor said she would do everything 'the same way again' if she had the opportunity.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: 'It was an extraordinary situation and I made my decision based on what I thought was right from a political and humanitarian standpoint.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Those kinds of extraordinary situations happen every once in a while in a country's history. The head of government has to act and I did.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a million people from across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East entered Germany  two years ago when Mrs Merkel opened her country's doors to&nbsp; Syrian  refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her party's support dropped as a consequence and led to&nbsp;a surge in support for the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which pollsters say could win up to 10 per cent in next month's election.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel also attacked EU countries that refused to accept migrants as part of a redistribution plan, explaining that such behaviour is 'not on'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That contradicts the spirit of Europe,' she said. 'We'll overcome that.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It will take time and patience but we will succeed.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         MERKEL WANTS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH LIBYA'S GOVERNMENT&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Merkel says she wants to work more closely with Libya's government to curtail illegal migration from Africa to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chancellor said in an interview with public broadcaster ZDF on Sunday that she supports training Libya's coast guard to prevent migrants from risking their lives by trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel says she also is interested in fostering a 'migration partnership' with Niger to inhibit the smuggling of migrants through African deserts on the way to Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is scheduled to meet in Paris on Monday with her French, Italian and Spanish counterparts, as well as the presidents of Chad, Niger and Libya, for talks on curbing migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four weeks before the September 24 election, an Emnid opinion poll showed Merkel's conservatives would win 38 per cent, or 15 points ahead of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is up from 32 per cent in February but well below the 41.5 per cent her party won in the last election in 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel, seeing a fourth term, has had to contend with loud and sustained heckling from demonstrators strongly opposed to her refugee policies so far on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volume and intensity of the protests have been especially strong in her home region in formerly communist eastern Germany.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 63-year-chancellor said she would not be kept away from areas where animosity towards her runs high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're a democracy and everyone can freely express themselves in public the way they want,' she said. 'It's important that we don't go out of our way to avoid certain areas only because there are a bunch of people screaming.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for Merkel and her party has recovered somewhat after the influx of refugees slowed in 2016 to 280,000 and fell even further to about 106,000 in the first seven months of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel said it was unfair that Greece and Italy were left on their own carrying the full burden of the refugee crisis 'simply because of their geography'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added she would not stop pushing for a distribution of refugees across the European Union.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ART AND DESIGN; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1018 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The knitted pink pussyhat, a pro-European Union poster campaign and a lending library of protest banners have been named some of the best designs of the year by the Design Museum in London, part of a 60-strong list that reflects a tumultuous time of global political unrest and creative popular resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nominations represent the most politically charged and socially engaged selection of projects on the tenth anniversary of the Beazley awards. The selections highlight designers' role in activist movements and the power of images and objects in disseminating campaign messages.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Los Angeles-based knitting enthusiasts Krista Suh and Jayna Zweiman launched their online pattern for a hat with cat-shaped ears in response to Donald Trump's remarks about grabbing women by the pussy, they can have had little idea that it would spawn the biggest &quot;craftivist&quot; movement of all time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day after Trump's inauguration in January, tens of thousands of people wearing pink-eared hats took to the streets of Washington and other cities around the world for Women's March, a memorable symbol of female solidarity and the power of collective action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of gender equality crops up in a number of this year's nominated designs. The Finding Her poster campaign, designed by the Japanese agency IC4 Design for the UN in Egypt, features a series of highly detailed scenes in the style of Where's Wally cartoons. They highlight the lack of women in the workplace in Egypt, where just 23% of the workforce is female. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The busy tableaux teem with workers, focusing on politics, science and technology, but the challenge is to find a woman. &quot;Finding women in technology shouldn't be this hard,&quot; reads the caption next to armies of engineers assembling a space shuttle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a message the world's tech giants are also waking up to. In May last year Google released a set of emoji icons featuring professional women, which also made the list of nominations in the graphics category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the launch of digital ideograms on Japanese mobile phones in the late 1990s, female representation had until then been confined to manicurists, brides and bunny girls, while men enjoyed cartoon careers as policemen, construction workers and cyclists. Given that women under 30 are most the frequent emoji users by far, the arrival of female doctors, teachers and builders was long overdue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit also looms large in this year's awards. One of few political issues in recent years to prompt an intelligent graphic response, Britain's vote to leave the EU has inspired designers to create poster and social media campaigns, banners, and T-shirts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Wolfgang Tillmans' campaign for the remain side used his powerful abstract landscape photographs overlaid with bold white text, while Nathan and Sam Smith conceived the Me &amp; EU project, a collection of postcards by more than 100 UK-based designers to be sent across Europe as a symbolic means of remaining connected following the referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other nominations celebrate the power of design in making the world a smaller, more connected and more intelligible place. Google and Monotype's landmark Noto typeface was the result of five years of collaboration with hundreds of linguists and designers in developing a free font that can work in at least 800 languages and scripts, from Latin and Cyrillic to Hebrew, Egyptian hieroglyphs and Cherokee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is joined by another sci-fi invention in the form of the world's first translating earpiece, developed by Waverly Labs, which can translate 15 different languages in real time in a matter of seconds, making the babelfish, imagined in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and Star Trek's Universal Translator, reality for the first time. Again showing the power of collective action, it was part of a crowdfunding campaign that raised more than $5m (&pound;3.9m) in pre-sale pledges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in last year's awards, when Ikea's flat-pack refugee shelter won the overall award, designers' innovative responses to unprecedented levels of global displacement and migration again feature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the product category is the Avy search and rescue drone, designed to help refugee boats crossing the Mediterranean, a perilous journey during which 3,500 refugees died last year. The drone is capable of flying long distances and can detect vessels and drop lifejackets, buoys, food supplies, medication and communication devices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Refugee Nation flag, designed for the first refugee Olympic team, is also nominated. Its simple thin black stripe across a vivid orange background was inspired by lifejackets. The Calais Builds Project, which provided short-term structures and infrastructure in the city's refugee camp, and Refugee Text, an SMS service that provides refugees with practical information and live updates on policy changes, were also nominated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The architecture category, as ever, feels a little out of place, but this year it includes a project of a very different kind to the international museums, schools and galleries. Led by the Israeli architect and researcher Eyal Weizman, the Forensic Architecture agency makes the list in the digital category for its immersive three-dimensional model of the Saydnaya prison in Syria, constructed through the memories and descriptions of former detainees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioned by Amnesty International, the project pieced together the layout of the notorious jail where thousands of people have been tortured and killed, creating a chilling simulation of the complex as part of a wider campaign to call on the Syrian government to allow independent monitors into its detention centres. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the most poignant piece in this compelling selection of projects that shows how design effects change far beyond the cosy realms of desirable homeware, 3D-printed fantasies and luxury furniture fairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The nominations for the Beazley Designs of the Year                      will be on display at the Design Museum in London from 18 October. A winner will be selected in each category and and the overall winner will be announced on 25 January 2018.                   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 480,000 Rohingya, mostly Muslim but also Hindu, have taken shelter in Bangladeshi refugee camps in the past month, leaving aid groups scrambling for provisions to help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several women are reporting that Muslim Rohingya are murdering Hindu men and taking the women as wives, forcing them to convert to Islam - or be killed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya are a &nbsp;stateless ethnic group that has been living mainly in Myanmar's Rakhine state for centuries. A majority of them are Muslim, but there is a small minority who are Hindu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since violence broke out in Rakhine a month ago, some&nbsp;480,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, the United Nations said Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Puja Mullick is a Hindu Rohingya who left Myanmar with her husband and family in hope of a refugee in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, along the way, she says her husband and entire family were shot in front of her and but she was left alive to live as a captive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says her family were not killed by the Myanmar army but by Rohingya men clad in black with their faces hidden, 'abusing in the name of religion.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They took us to the forest and said I would have to read namaz [Muslim prayer] or they would release me...&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'My sindoor [red cosmetic powder worn by Hindu women in their parting or a a bindi] was removed and my religious marital bangles broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I was told I would be allowed to live only if I changed my religion. I was made to wear burqa and stay with them to learn their traditions for almost three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I was made to read Muslim prayer and I had to pray to Allah. My family started searching for me and came to know that I was living in a Muslim camp.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to Mail Today at the Hindu Rohingya camp in Kotupalong area of Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh, she says her red sari is the only item of clothing she owns, and that her three-year-old son has no clothes at all.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rica Dhar, 28, narrates a similar tragic tale as she feeds her young son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'On Friday (August 25) they entered all the Hindu residences and attacked. First the mobile phones were taken away and then men were tied and beaten brutally. My husband worked as a goldsmith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They took away all my jewellery and began beating me. All Hindus were identified and taken to a nearby hill. They were then killed in a row. Only eight women were allowed to stay among them... mostly young and beautiful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They were told ''You will have to turn Muslim and marry us''. We had no option but to surrender and go with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We were taken to the forest and left without food to weaken us mentally also. Then we were brought to a camp in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Dhar says she was only saved when some of her Hindu relatives found out about her predicament and brought her to a Hindu camp.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ms Dhar and Ms Mullick say there were six more women&nbsp;who shared their fate, who were still living in the Muslim majority camp with their captors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are victims of Burma army and now we are being tortured here also. Eight women who were here from Myanmar....they were forcibly taken to another camp and were asked to convert to Islam,'&nbsp;Vijay Ram Pal, a Hindu Rohingya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Thankfully, a person here in the camp came to save them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked, government officials were clueless about what was going on. 'We do not have any such information,' said Md. Ali Hossain, deputy commissioner of Cox's Bazar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If it has occurred, we will take necessary action.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bangladesh's information minister Hasanul Haq Inu was informed about the situation by MailToday, he promised action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The news is very bad and astounding... we have taken all measures to put Rohingya Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Buddhist families in separate camps,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We will be investigating this and we will be very tough.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Burma's military forces launched a brutal offensive against the country's Rohingya population on 25August, more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The desperate refugees are building makeshift shelters in areas designated as wild elephant routes. Cox's Bazar, the region where Friday's attack took place, is home to around 78 of Bangladesh's 268 wild elephants. It hosts eight designated routes through forest land for the elephants to use, which keep locals safe by steering the animals away from land occupied by humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the numbers of refugees fleeing to the area has required the Bangladeshi government to fell more than 1,000 acres of forest to make space for 150,000 tarpaulin shelters, Bangladesh's Secretary of Disaster Management and Relief Mohammad Shah Kamal told Reuters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first vulnerable child refugee stranded in Greece who qualifies for sanctuary under the Dubs amendment has arrived in the UK, more than a year after the government pledged to bring over hundreds of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office had accepted that the boy was vulnerable and eligible for transfer 16 months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dubs amendment, part of the 2016 Immigration Act, was passed after a campaign to transfer 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees stuck in camps to Britain. There are more than 3,300 unaccompanied children in Greece, 11,186 in France and 13,867 in Italy. The Home Office agreed to resettle 480 under the Dubs scheme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions for lone children in Greece have been condemned by Human Rights Watch, which found filthy cells infested with bugs and vermin, sometimes without mattresses or access to showers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammersmith and Fulham council in west London has stepped in to offer the boy a home and one of its social workers travelled to Greece to assess the child, who has lost contact with his family in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boy, who is said to be deeply traumatised, was detained until last month in a police cell with no access to medical professionals, and forced to sleep on an inch-thick mattress on the ground. Police said the boy had repeatedly self-harmed, tried to kill himself and was at &quot;imminent risk&quot; of doing this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Antonia Moustaka, a lawyer for the humanitarian agency Praksis, he spent more than 380 days in psychiatric clinics, 124 days in shelters for unaccompanied minors and six weeks in police detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boy has been taken to a flat in Hammersmith provided by the local authority and will receive 24-hour care. Council officials will begin the process of assessing his long-term needs. A social worker was permitted to meet and accompany him through the airport when he landed on Friday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A council spokesman said he appeared well but anxious. &quot;We have a Greek-speaking mental health specialist social worker with him who worked with him in Greece,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council is already accommodating and supporting 13 Dubs children from France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Gabriel, the project lead at the charity Safe Passage, said: &quot;There are more than 3,300 unaccompanied children in Greece and only 1,130 spaces in shelters. The winter is bitterly cold and conditions are getting worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over a year and a half ago, the Dubs amendment brought hope that hundreds of these kids would be brought to safety. It has been appalling to watch these minors wait, month after month, on bureaucratic delays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammersmith and Fulham council's leader, Steve Cowan, said: &quot;We worked closely with Safe Passage, who alerted us to this case. This child has a legal right to come to Britain and deserves so much more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josie Naughton of the charity Help Refugees said: &quot;While we are thrilled to hear of this child being brought to safety, we are heartbroken at how long it has taken. One child in two years is unacceptable under any circumstances.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naughton said Help Refugees, Safe Passage and the Refugee Rights Data Project had written a joint letter to the home secretary demanding the immediate identification, assessment and transfer of child refugees under the Dubs amendment, to meet the government's target of 480.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;We remain committed to transferring 480 children from Europe to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act. We have accepted further referrals this year and transfers are ongoing. We will continue to work closely with EU partners and local authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our wider focus remains helping those in need of international protection in the region, which is why we have committed to resettle up to 23,000 refugees from the region - almost 9,000 are already rebuilding their lives in the UK - and the government has pledged &pound;2.46bn to the humanitarian response to the Syria conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spanning everything from graphics to transport design, the 10th iteration of the annual awards and exhibition includes a search and rescue drone that assists refugees and the national place branding for Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wales Nation Brand, by Sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord Studio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London's Design Museum has announced the nominees for the 10th anniversary edition of the Beazley Designs of the Year award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual award and accompanying exhibition, which takes place at the Design Museum's site in Kensington, West London, looks to celebrate the best design from all over the world during the last 12 months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 62 nominees have been chosen by a panel of designers, curators and creators, and span six different categories, including digital; graphics; product; transport; architecture; and fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping with last year's overall winner - Ikea's flat-packed refugee shelter Better Shelter - many of the selected designs this year also look to help alleviate the human impact of the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes the Avy Search and Rescue Drone, which is designed to help refugees in danger while travelling across the Mediterranean Sea by detecting boats, and dropping life jackets, food, medication and other supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activism and protest is another strong theme among this year's nominations. The distinctive, pink Pussyhat made for the anti-Donald Trump women's march earlier this year has been nominated as part of the fashion category, and David Adjaye Associates' design for the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington D.C. has been shortlisted in architecture, making a strong political statement about the importance of the black community in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the graphics category, Tony Brook, Adrian Shaughnessy and Patricia Finegan have been nominated for their work as part of design-led publisher Unit Editions, with recent projects including a monograph dedicated to the life and work of Pentagram partner Paula Scher, and a book documenting the visual diaries of graphic designer Lance Wyman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sketches and models</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord Studio is also included in the graphics category for its work developing a new national brand identity for Wales, which includes a contemporary play on the country's instantly recognisable dragon symbol, and a bespoke typeface called Cymru Wales Sans inspired by the Welsh language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other nominees include Air-Ink, a collection of ink-based products made out of carbon emissions from cars, augmented reality (AR) mobile gaming app Pok&eacute;mon Go, and DixonBaxi's on-air branding for the Premier League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the transport category sees a conceptual traffic system for self-driving vehicles that would eliminate the need for traditional traffic light signals, and an autonomous, electric tram that's guided by a double-dashed line painted on the street rather than tracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sketches, models, physical pieces, videos and photography of all the nominated designs will go on display as part of an exhibition at the Design Museum from 18 October 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A winner from each category and one overall winner will be announced on 25 January 2018.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The healthcare provider for Australia's offshore processing regime, International Health and Medical Services has been contracted by the Papua New Guinean government to stay beyond the closure of the Manus Island detention centre at the end of the month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the recently signed contract IHMS will continue providing healthcare to refugees - who are expected to settle in the PNG community - and non-refugees in Lorengau and in Port Moresby, but it is not known how long for.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG's general healthcare system is in crisis, with reported shortages of medication across multiple regions, including Manus province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Sri Lankan Tamil refugee found dead on Manus Island</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Medical care will continue to cover mental health services and will transition clients on to a PNG formulary, where it is considered clinically safe to do so,&quot; an IHMS spokeswoman told Guardian Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, with closure of the Manus RPC [regional processing centre], services can no longer be provided at that location.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokeswoman said as a result detainees were being assisted to &quot;self-manage&quot; their medications during the transition to having to access services in the community or in Port Moresby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would note that self-management of medications is the norm in most doctor-patient relationships around the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some medical professionals were concerned at the decision, noting the high prevalence of mental health issues among the cohort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is potentially a very risky strategy in that some of the medication these people are on relate to mental health problems,&quot; said Prof Louise Newman, a spokeswoman for the Asylum Seekers Advocacy Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is heightened tension there at the moment, reports of people whose mental health is deteriorating, we have a couple of deaths thought to be suicides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a very volatile environment so from a mental health perspective this is a very risky strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian Australia understands risk assessments were conducted before patients were given a month's worth of medication, but IHMS would not detail how many - or if any - patients were deemed too much of a risk to include.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions as to whether it was an interim measure or if larger prescriptions would continue to be handed out once the new system was in place were also not answered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia must act to stop 'humanitarian emergency' in Manus, says UNHCR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Peter Young, the former head of mental health at IHMS, said without knowing what support the organisation was giving to patients once the centre closed, it was impossible to know if the decision was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of that cohort of people being released in the community, you'd expect there to be a number with mental health problems requiring a high level of support and follow-up attention,&quot; Young said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without knowing what is constituting the service IHMS says they'll be providing, I'd certainly think handing out a month of medications without supervision could be negligent and dangerous. They should be open about this and to show exactly what support will be provided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 900 men remain in Papua New Guinea after being sent there for detention and processing by Australian immigration authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities have been steadily closing sections of the centre around detainees, shutting basic services and threatening arrest as part of efforts to encourage people to move into the nearby town of East Lorengau - if they are refugees - or to return to their country of origin if they are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday the United Nations warned of a looming humanitarian emergency as a result of the closure and urged the Australian government to step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus refugee Behrouz Boochani asks for UK visa to attend screening of his film</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter distributed to detainees on Thursday warned that all food, water, sewage facilities and electricity would cease inside the centre after 31 October. The note, written in Farsi, also said the fences would be taken down and the site returned to the control of the PNG defence force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kurdish Iranian journalist Behrouz Boochani said the note had sparked fear among his fellow asylum seekers and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The refugees have already had a bad experience with PNG navy soldiers, on Good Friday this year, when they attacked the detention centre and fired guns into the centre,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unacceptable to put refugees in this situation - either move to Lorengau where they risk attack by angry local people, or be taken over by PNG defence forces who have already seriously threatened their safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre warned the situation &quot;could be about to turn into a bloodbath&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;PNG military personnel have attacked these men once before,&quot; Daniel Webb said. &quot;Now our government is tearing down the fences and putting them in charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have raided the homes of accused Flinders Street rampage driver&nbsp;Saeed Noori's family searching for clues to why he mowed down 17 people at a busy intersection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 32-year-old Afghan refugee was dragged from the car and arrested minutes after he ploughed through crowds of Christmas shoppers and commuters outside Flinders Street Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said it did not appear to a terrorist attack but raided two homes in&nbsp;Heidelberg West and Oak Park - where Noori lives - in Melbourne's north on Thursday night, hours after the terrifying incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family members present were reportedly cooperatives as forensics teams seized electronic items from the homes that police will comb through for clues about Noori's motives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At this stage nothing has been found to indicate a linkage to extremism, a terrorist organisation or anything of a terrorist nature,' police told Daily Mail Australia on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking briefly to investigators last night as he lay in a hospital bed at St Vincent's under police guard, the Noori made a 'number of utterances' and 'spoke about dreams and voices'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But he also did attribute some of his actions to the poor treatment of Muslims,' Acting Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said on Friday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Patton said Noori had a history of drug use and mental illness, stressing that investigators had not yet found any extremist or terrorist links to the horror rampage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noori&nbsp;arrived in Australia as a refugee in 2004 through a resettlement program, and had several run-ins with the law between 2008 and earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He came to Australia as a refugee. He did not come with a people smuggler, he came through the appropriate refugee, the normal refugee programs,' Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At this stage, because investigations are continuing, apart from that statement, there are no known links to any political issues or any, certainly any links to extremist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Therefore, the position I am advised off at the moment is that no terrorism link has been identified at this stage. I want to stress, there is a mass of material that is being investigated and nothing should be ruled out, nothing should be ruled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Now, whatever the motivation, this was a despicable and cowardly act, but I want to reassure all Australians that this is an isolated incident.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noori's legal issues started with a minor assault charge in 2010 that was dropped after he pleaded guilty to recklessly causing injury and was fined $800.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in June this year he was convicted and fined $1000 after pleading guilty to driving while unlicensed, using a mobile phone while driving, and failing to answer bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missing bail charges was from when he missed a court date for the driving offences, which occurred either early this year or late last year, and which he also faced court for in February.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noori was released from hospital on Friday afternoon and taken to Melbourne Police Station where detectives hope to formally interview him and potentially lay charges after that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second man was arrested after filming the car ploughing through crowds outside Melbourne's Flinders Street train station and charged with weapons and drug offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police confirmed the man, 24, was not believed to have been involved in the carnage that injured 19 including the driver but they hope the footage he took will be useful to investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria Police's acting Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said the man had now been charged with&nbsp;cannabis and weapons charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He ran, was grabbed, and arrested,' Mr Patton told 3AW. 'We don't believe he was involved in this matter at all.&nbsp;His footage may be valuable.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victims of the rampage included a four-year-old boy with serious head injuries, but in a stable condition, and three others still in critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others were men aged&nbsp;25, 40, 43, 45, and 83; two 25-year-old women, and other women aged 30, 35, 47, and 58 along with another three men and two women of unknown age.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the 'horrific act' was targeted against 'innocent bystanders'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is a terrible, evil, cowardly act... At a time of the year when so many families are celebrating the end of they year, doing their Christmas shopping... we have seen a horrific act,' he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witness described seeing the car hurtling towards the crowd, ploughing through people in its path and crashing into the pole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It just mowed everybody down, people were flying everywhere. We heard thump, thump. People are running everywhere,' one told radio station 3AW:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dramatic footage then showed a number of injured pedestrians being treated by passersby as they wait for paramedics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He has gone straight through the red light at pace and it was bang, bang, bang. It was just one after the other,' another told the Herald Sun.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There were bodies on the ground and people running up to them - it was mayhem.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a year of major policy shifts in U.S. immigration. In this alert, we provide an update on recent developments in business immigration in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court's Stance on Trump's Travel Ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 26, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court permitted portions of President Trump's travel ban to take effect. The Court ruled that citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen may be denied entry to the United States in the absence of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bona fide relationship might include a relative in the United States, employment with a U.S. employer or students enrolled in a U.S. school. Consular officials and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers will be the government officials charged with determining the meaning of a bona fide relationship. The ruling is good news for refugees, as the majority of refugees selected by the U.S. government for resettlement in the United States already have family members in the country, and for those who do not, ties to U.S.-based refugee organizations would likely also be considered a strong connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling further clarified that the ongoing refugee resettlement efforts will not be subject to the 50,000 person cap for this fiscal year proposed by the Executive Order. The Court confirmed it would hear the case in full in the fall of 2017. The decision appears to support an ultimate victory for the Trump administration on the merits given the language in the dissent by Justice Thomas, who stated, &quot;Today's compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding - on peril of contempt - whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Developments on H-1B Petition Submissions and Premium Processing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has commenced adjudication of H-1B petitions filed in the first five days of April 2017, and it has also started to mail out rejection notices for cases not selected in the random H-1B Cap Lottery. USCIS announced that 199,000 petitions were submitted this fiscal year for the 85,000 highly sought after visas. It also announced that it will reinstate H-1B premium processing for select foreign physicians - specifically those who already submitted H-1B petitions under the Conrad 30 Waiver Program for interested government agency waivers. This announcement serves to alleviate the anxiety for employers of foreign physicians that depend upon issuance of waivers to fill positions following residency and fellowship programs, typically commencing on July 1 each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to submit a request to update a pending H-1B petition to premium processing, a Form I-907 and filing fee of $1,225.00 is submitted to the appropriate USCIS Service Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since April 3, 2017, USCIS has suspended premium processing for all H-1B petition submissions. The suspension is expected to last up to six months. USCIS stated that the suspension will permit it to improve processing times for H-1B pending petitions. Recently, USCIS announced that it does intend to resume premium processing in the H-1B visa category by petition types, which will be announced as available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E Visa Summer Updates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summertime brings delays at U.S. consulates worldwide that process the E-1 Treaty Trader and E-2 Treaty Investor visa applications. Given additional &quot;extreme vetting&quot; requirements, it would be appropriate for foreign nationals who are planning to submit E Visa applications at consular posts globally to check processing times located on the post's website prior to making plans to move to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our  Immigration practice group will continue to monitor and report on developments in this area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Images of families and children in makeshift refugee camps around Calais and Dunkirk have disappeared from the media, but the refugee crisis remains unabated and, for those continuing to search for a more hopeful future, the situation is just as grim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why tomorrow, I have co-sponsored a debate in Parliament to remind those with the power to change people's lives that this suffering continues and they have the tools to end it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week marked one year since the demolition of what came to be known as the Jungle camp in Calais. Although the timing of the decision taken by the French authorities was highly questionable, the spirit behind this demolition was right - no one should live in those sorts of conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I visited these camps on more than one occasion, spending time with families who felt that this location was their only option and the charities working tirelessly to provide support and advice to them. I met lots of children who were without adult guardians. For some their parents had paid traffickers to get them to Europe, to safety; for others they had lost their parents to conflict or become separated while fleeing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee explains what it's like sleeping rough in Calais</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument goes (from those who seem intent on turning Britain into an insular and mean country) that these people have reached European shores, they are safe, so why do they seem so intent on coming to Britain? This desire is not the same for every person. Of those I spoke to, some wanted to come here because they could speak English; for others they had friends of family members who could help them settle in and restart their lives; and for some it was the recognition that Britain has always welcomed those whose own homes had become too dangerous. All of these reasons are legitimate, but for those with family already in the UK they have a legal right to be here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, out of the demolition the Government conceded to transferring 750 children to Britain, of which 550 were reunited with family here. These transfers should never have been a one-off. Rough estimates suggest that around 1,000 refugees are now in Calais and surrounding camps including an estimated 200 unaccompanied children. These people are not only vulnerable to the elements - using trees as shelter, they are also vulnerable to evil traffickers and others who would do them harm. For children, no place could be more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary colleagues from all parties banded together to secure a commitment from the Government to accept unaccompanied refugee children who had made it to Europe after treacherous journeys from flashpoints elsewhere in the world. This became known as the Dubs scheme, and we who fought for it, both in and outside Parliament, expected that the Government would offer sanctuary to thousands of children. We were bitterly disappointed by both the Government's initial measly quota of 480 unaccompanied children and their subsequent decision this year to close the scheme after allocating under half of those places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, with Brexit negotiations under way and family reunification rules on the table, we must ensure that vulnerable children continue to have access to safe and legal routes to come to the UK. There is no shame in reversing a bad decision, and that is what I will be asking ministers to do tomorrow by reopening the Dubs scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weather is turning once again and for many it will be the most bitter winter of their lives. It doesn't need to be this way. Britain must not turn a blind eye and betray our history as a compassionate and caring country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of thousands of Syrian refugees have returned to the country so far this year amid fresh hope for lasting ceasefires in some cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said it was seeing a &quot;notable trend of spontaneous returns&quot; from outside and inside the country. Around 31,000 refugees returned from neighbouring countries in the first six months of 2017, while more than 440,000 internally displaced people went back to their homes - a combined total of almost half a million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrej Mahecic, a spokesperson for the UNHCR, said the main destinations were Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus - all of which are partly or wholly controlled by the Syrian government after devastating battles against rebel groups. Mr Mahecic said Syrians were seeking out family members, checking on property, and &quot;in some cases responding to a real or perceived improvement in security conditions in parts of the country&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he warned that although there is fresh hope over recent peace talks in Astana and Geneva, the &quot;UNHCR believes conditions for refugees to return in safety and dignity are not yet in place in Syria&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sustainability of security improvements in many return areas is uncertain, and there remain significant risks of protection thresholds for voluntary, safe and dignified returns not being met in parts of the country,&quot; he added. &quot;Access to the displaced population inside Syria remains a key challenge, with aid convoys still unable to access regularly even the recently newly accessible areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limited progress has been made in the UN-backed peace talks in Geneva, while the West is wary of ceasefires brokered by Bashar al-Assad's allies Russia and Iran, and rebel-supporting Turkey in Astana. Isis and al-Qaeda linked alliance Tahrir al-Sham are barred from all talks and continue to hold swathes of territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR is scaling up its operations inside Syria for the new arrivals, providing &quot;protection services&quot; and shelter and improving damaged infrastructure and basic services. It warned that mass returns will not be sustainable without employment opportunities, adequate food and water, health care and education - all of which have been severely damaged by the six-year civil war, seeing the illegal targeting of infrastructure and widespread destruction of hospitals and schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this stage and while UNHCR will be investing to help, with other partners to improve conditions in accessible areas inside Syria, refugee returns from host countries can neither be promoted nor facilitated by UNHCR,&quot; Mr Mahecic said. He emphasised that access to asylum for Syrians and allowing them to stay in host countries remained &quot;critical&quot;, reiterating an appeal for $304m (&pound;230m) in funding for displaced people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Kennedy, the UN regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria, said almost 14 million of the 18 million people currently living in the country in need of some form of humanitarian assistance. Of those, 4.5 million are trapped in besieged or hard to reach areas &quot;in desperate need&quot; of aid, which is being blocked by both the Syrian government and rebel groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over one third of Syrians are displaced within the country, while about 5 million more have fled, mainly to Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Since 2015, at least 260,000 refugees have spontaneously returned to Syria, primarily from neighbouring Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European countries including Germany, Austria and Norway have been offering financial incentives for asylum seekers to voluntarily return to their home nations as borders have hardened throughout the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority of Syrians arrived on treacherous boat crossings to Greek islands but arrivals have slowed to a trickle since the controversial EU-Turkey deal was imposed in March last year, seeing anyone arriving over the Aegean Sea detained under threat of deportation. The main sea route to Europe became the Central Mediterranean - now the deadliest sea passage in the world - claiming more than 2,000 lives so far this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 92,000 migrants have arrived on European shores since January - 83,600 to Italy and 9,000 to Greece - mostly from sub-Saharan African nations, Bangladesh and Morocco. Syrians, who once made up the largest group of asylum seekers making the journey, account for only 8 per cent of those arriving in 2017.</SPAN></P>

However, existing disputes are unlikely to undermine generally cordial relations amid the continuation of trade and diplomatic ties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh and Myanmar signed an agreement on October 24 to cooperate on border security and repatriate Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, which in our view indicates that bilateral tensions over the issue are likely to subside for the time being. The influx of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh and Myanmar's treatment of the Rohingya people have long been a source of friction between the two countries, and the issue will likely resurface periodically in the absence of a permanent solution. That said, we expect bilateral ties to remain unaffected for the most part as trade and diplomatic relations continue uninterrupted as disagreements have rarely escalated beyond heated rhetoric from both sides. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Repatriation Agreement Signals An End To Current Tensions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In our view, the October security and repatriation agreement will help ease tensions over the current Rohingya issue, where approximately 582,000 refugees are estimated by the UN to have crossed the border into Bangladesh between August and October 2017. The influx triggered a war of words between government officials from both sides, with Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accusing Myanmar of ethnic cleansing during a speech to the UN in September. In early November, a spokesman for Myanmar state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi accused Dhaka of stalling the Rohingya repatriation process to obtain international aid money.However, we believe that ties will improve over the coming months following Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali's scheduled official visit to Myanmar on November 30. In addition, both countries have agreed to take action against suspected Rohingya militants that have fled into Bangladesh, which should go some way in addressing mutual security concerns.<BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Sources: BMI, The Wire, BBC, Reuters    </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">But Frictions Likely To Resurface</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rohingya issue has long been a source of friction between Dhaka and Naypyidaw, and we believe that disputes are likely to persist in the absence of a long-term solution. Bangladesh has often decried Myanmar's treatment of the Rohingya people, while Myanmar has accused Bangladesh of using the Rohingyas to obtain foreign aid. Neither Myanmar nor Bangladesh appears willing to accommodate the Rohingyas on a permanent basis, and this has resulted in constant shuffling of Rohingya refugees between the two countries. On one hand, Myanmar, which has denied the Rohingyas citizenship since 1982, considers them 'Bengalis' without the right of abode within its borders. On the other hand, Bangladesh, while generally sympathetic to the Rohingya plight due to religious affiliations, has repeatedly repatriated Rohingya refugees to Myanmar citing security and economic concerns. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bilateral Ties To Remain On An Even Keel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, bilateral discord has largely been confined to the heated exchange of words and we believe the Rohingya issue is unlikely to undermine long standing trade and diplomatic ties between Dhaka and Naypyidaw. Indeed, Bangladesh's Food Minister Qamrul Islam paid an official visit to Myanmar in September and signed a deal to purchase 300,000 tons of rice, stating that bilateral trade would continue. Furthermore, the Rohingya issue notwithstanding, Bangladesh and Myanmar continued to exchange top-level diplomatic visits and have inked multiple agreements such as the 1973 General Trade Agreement and the 2003 Joint Business Council, which leads us to believe that bilateral ties are likely to remain cordial. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE teenage terror suspect arrested at the Port of Dover following the Parsons Green attack was fostered by at least two families in Kent, it has been claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to The Mirror, the 18-year-old suspected of planting the tube bomb on Friday (September 15) is a refugee from Iraq who came to Britain after his parents were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the suspect arrested in Dover - who has not yet been named - had come to Britain as a 15-year-old after he had spent months attempting to smuggle himself into the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also been widely reported that the teenager lived just across the Channel for a period of time, in the notorious makeshift Calais refugee camp known as The Jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee charity is believed to have helped his passage into Britain in 2014 and placed him in foster care with at least two families in Kent, before he moved in with another family in South West London in the last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear as to where in Kent the suspect was fostered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;It is important to know the full facts and circumstances in which he came to Britain and the checks that were made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's clearly urgent we have answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just hours after the teen was surrounded by several armed officers at the Port of Dover departure lounge, police raided the Surrey home of foster parents Ronald, 89, and Penelope Jones, 71.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair, who live around 100 miles away from the Kent town, were awarded with MBEs in 2009 for caring for over 250 vulnerable children, many of which included refugees from war-torn countries Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative leader of Spelthorne Borough Council Ian Harvey - whose ward is Sunbury East close to where the teenager had been living - said: &quot;One thing I understand is that he was an Iraqi refugee who came here aged 15. His parents died in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;troublemaker&quot; teenager was arrested earlier this month but freed by cops, neighbours have claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kent Police officers arrested the 18-year-old just before 8am on suspicion of a terrorist offence in a departure area at Dover port on Saturday (September 16) following the attack which left 30 people injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyewitness reports state that the Iraqi teenager appeared shocked and &quot;froze&quot; on the spot as officers arrested him at the port ticket office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenage suspect had been trying to leave the UK as a foot passenger on a Dover ferry at 7.50am - almost 24 hours after the blast in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 21-year-old in Hounslow, West London was also arrested at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national terror threat level has been reduced from &quot;critical&quot; to &quot;severe&quot; following the arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the reduction, Kent Police superintendent Phil Hibben said: &quot;There remains nothing to suggest there is a specific threat to Kent at this time but highly visible firearms officers have been patrolling key locations in Kent as part of our current deployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Additional patrols were also brought in to deal with normal day-to-day policing as a result and this will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We continue to ask the public to remain alert, but not alarmed. If anyone sees anything suspicious, they should ring 999 or by calling the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">927 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The competition among United Nations officials to make the most irritating comment about the UK continues. There was the UN human rights expert who said sexism was more pervasive here than in any other country she had visited. Then the UN special representative for international migration described British plans to build a wall around the port of Calais as &quot;inhumane&quot;. Now we have Volker T&uuml;rk, of the UN high commissioner for refugees, vying hard for first prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Mr T&uuml;rk said the UK needs to &quot;step up&quot; and help to address the migrant crisis. Never mind that we have committed hundreds of millions to help refugees in the camps around Syria, or that in 2016 we resettled more refugees than any other country in the European Union; the panjandrum decrees that we should double the number of refugees we take in. He criticised UK politicians for &quot;irresponsible&quot; rhetoric, called for &quot;more understanding&quot; and asked for everyone who works in this area to listen to the &quot;voice of reason within&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Mr T&uuml;rk and his ilk who are ignoring reason and who have been catastrophically irresponsible in stoking mass migration. It is time their approach is roundly rejected. We do not need more &quot;understanding&quot; or one more heave on refugee numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The migrant crisis of the past few years has been a lesson in the dangers of allowing heart to overrule head. From Angela Merkel's &quot;refugees welcome&quot; policy to the NGO boats searching the Mediterranean for migrants to rescue, short-term compassion has escalated the crisis, strengthening the magnet that draws millions to Europe from developing countries. We may see fewer pictures of packed boats on our screens these days but the numbers are growing. More than 83,000 migrants arrived in southern Italy in the first half of this year, up 19 per cent on the first six months of last year. More than 2,300 have died on the crossing in 2017. In Calais a new Jungle camp is forming, with about 1,000 migrants sleeping rough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The line between refugees and economic migrants is increasingly blurred. The top three home nations of those arriving in Italy in the first quarter of this year were Nigeria, Bangladesh and Guinea. UN figures suggest that seven in ten who have come to Libya are escaping poverty. When the UK took in 750 children (or young people) from the Jungle last year, fewer than ten were from Syria. From Senegal to Bangladesh, millions have their sights set on a life in Europe. Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, recently warned that there will be an &quot;exodus of biblical proportions if we don't confront the problem&quot;. Which of our leaders will dare to say it: that this surge from poorer nations must be stopped more forcibly? That for the sake of Europe and the developing world a much harder line must be drawn in the sand between them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most will sympathise with those who yearn to escape poverty, especially when the internet has pressed their noses to the window of the prosperous West. But behind every one who makes it to Italy are many more who will be emboldened to set out on the same journey. The potential numbers are dizzying. An acceleration of the current crisis would be a disaster not only for the West but for the developing nations who would lose a swathe of their young, fit, enterprising citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long-term, the most benevolent and sensible strategy is to improve life in the poorest countries and so weaken the desire to migrate. But tackling this &quot;push factor&quot; will be the work of decades. There are two &quot;pull factors&quot; that must be addressed urgently. The first is the knowledge that once rescued in the central Mediterranean, passage to mainland Europe is assured. The ploy of the people traffickers is to deliver the migrants not to Italy, but just past the boundary of Libya's territorial waters so that they can be rescued by the NGO ships beyond. Though motivated by noble instincts, the charities patrolling these waters are effectively aiding the traffickers, and they must be stopped from doing so. The Italians are beleaguered and need more international support to work with the Libyan coastguard to return the boats to Libyan ports. As Bill Gates (not a noted hardliner) has said: &quot;Europe must make it more difficult for Africans to reach the continent via the current transit routes.&quot; Turning back the boats might not be a palatable proposal short-term but until and unless the central Mediterranean is viewed as a route of no hope, the numbers will continue to increase along with the profits of the people traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second great pull factor is the UN's woefully out-of-date Refugee Convention. Its definition of an asylum-seeker as anyone with a &quot;well-founded fear of persecution in their own country&quot; is elastic enough, with a little imagination, to cover many millions of people. It was developed before smartphones gave those in the developing world the ability to learn their rights according to international law. If simply stepping on to the hallowed ground of the West will earn you a hearing and a decent chance of staying, you will do anything to reach that land. Only if western countries reform the convention, radically tightening the definition of persecution, do we have a hope of controlling the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt various UN officials would say such actions lack compassion. The alternative is dragging out this disaster, drawing more to endanger their lives, enriching the people smugglers, overwhelming European nations and hardening hearts against genuine asylum-seekers. That does not sound much like compassion to me.@clarefoges</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist and detainee on Manus, said the biggest immediate issue was the trauma that many men had experienced as a result of the beatings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After four and a half years here, someone beat them. They are traumatised and humiliated,&quot; he said by phone from Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big issue is there are no psychological facilities on Manus. They need people to talk to,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite completion of the relocation by the PNG police, the atmosphere on the island remains tense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Costello said local police and immigration authorities had told the men they were looking for alternative accommodation for the 57 but it was not clear what would happen. There was also resentment among the local population about Australia's actions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most people are friendly but there are elements who resent what's going on, including one community leader who expressed to me the view that Australia had just walked away from its responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even the police commissioner feels that way: that the Australian government has just left,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to sway the Australian prime minister on refugee policy, a group of Rhodes scholars has written to their fellow Oxford alumnus, Malcolm Turnbull, expressing &quot;disapproval, horror and shame&quot; at the treatment of detainees being held on Manus and Nauru. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia built a hell for refugees on Manus. The shame will outlive us all | Richard Flanagan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tight-knit global community counts Turnbull and former prime minister Tony Abbott among its members and is made up of former international students from around the world who have studied at Oxford on scholarships from the Rhodes Trust, set up by Sir Cecil Rhodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty scholars have signed the letter. While most are from Australia, there are several from South Africa, Pakistan, Canada, the US and New Zealand who have put their names to the open letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter does not reflect the views of the trust itself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been over two weeks since your government decided to cut off electricity and stop providing food and water to the 600 men detained on Manus. The situation is now a humanitarian crisis,&quot; the group wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia must finally take responsibility for the welfare of those it has detained and left languishing offshore. The fate of those men is in your hands - as is Australia's international reputation,&quot; they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are extremely disappointed that you, as a Rhodes Scholar, have failed to act to prevent the crisis on Manus. Your lack of leadership and compassion in this instance is at odds with the values of the Rhodes community.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">600 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE EU was accused of raping' its own values yesterday after its top court ruled that countries should be forced to accept refugees under a relocation scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an escalating row over its migration policy, Brussels threatened to sanction any member states who refuse to comply after the European Court of Justice dismissed a complaint about the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the warning was met with a furious response by Eastern European countries who have opposed the system, highlighting escalating splits over how to deal with the ongoing migration crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling came after Hungary and Slovakia asked the ECJ to quash an EU decision to share 120,000 refugees in Italy and Greece at the height of Europe's migrant influx in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary accused the Luxembourg court of making an outrageous and irresponsible' politically driven decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said: Politics has raped European law and European values. This decision practically and openly legitimates the power of the EU above the member states.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Brussels expects previously non-compliant countries to accept refugees within weeks, Mr Szijjarto pre-empted a bitter stand-off by saying all legal means' would be used to oppose the decision. He added: The real battle is only just beginning.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary has refused to accept a single refugee as part of its hard-line response to the crisis that also saw an electronic fence being built along its border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument comes after months of increasingly hostile political debate between Eastern European countries and Brussels over its handling of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Brussels has insisted the move is necessary to help deal with the 1.6?million people who arrived in Greece and Italy since 2014, the countries say it is not their responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also say that opening their borders to refugees from migrants from war-torn countries such as Syria could leave them open to the threat of terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the UK has an opt-out on EU rules regarding asylum, it decided not to take part in the scheme. Beata Szydlo, the Polish prime minister, said: We expected this decision. However, this does not change the position of the Polish government on migration policy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slovakia prime minister Robert Fico said his government fully respects the court's decision' but added that the quotas were politically wrong'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ECJ's ruling said: The court dismisses the actions brought by Slovakia and Hungary against the provisional mechanism for the mandatory relocation of asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That mechanism actually contributes to enabling Greece and Italy to deal with the impact of the 2015 migration crisis and is proportionate.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said the court's decision was an opportunity' to end in-fighting between member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said those countries that refused to take part could be referred to the ECJ and potentially face sizeable fines for breaching EU law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Member states could also be subject to funding cuts from Brussels in the future, while Germany has said that those who do not accept migrants could be asked to leave the bloc. It is time to be united and show full solidarity,' Mr Avramopoulos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The door remains, it is still open, and we should convince all member states to fulfill their commitments. But we should be clear that member states have to show solidarity now because it is now that some member states need help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the member states do not change their approach in the coming weeks we should then consider to take the last step in the infringement procedure: to refer Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to the ECJ.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A MEMORIAL plaque will be unveiled next month to remember a Bolton volunteer who died fighting fascism in the Spanish Civil War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Alwyn died at the Battle of Jarama, to the south of Madrid, in February 1937 and will now have his sacrifice honoured on the plaque at Bolton Socialist Club.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little is known about the solider, who is thought to be the only International Brigade volunteer from Bolton who was killed in the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaque will be unveiled at 1pm on Saturday, September 16 at the Wood Street club by Maria Luisa Toole, a 92-year-old Basque refugee who was sent to England aged 11 and later moved to Bolton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and her elder brother were the last two of almost 4,000 children to board the SS Habana to the UK and were originally settled in Cambridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lisa Croft, of the International Brigade Memorial Trust, has helped organise the memorial alongside the Socialist Club and Bolton Trades Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;We have been trying for quite a while to get this memorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bolton has a long history of helping refugees and was more involved in the Spanish Civil War than most people would probably think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The town sent an ambulance to Spain, which was quite amazing during a time in the 1930s when people had very little money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Basque refugee children also came here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is great that, to this day, Bolton has a strong connection with helping refugees in times of crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new plaque will be accompanied by an exhibition showcasing Bolton's role in supporting Republican fighters during the three-year war and helping refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other volunteers who either lived or were born in Bolton include Joseph William Moran, Philip Neville Harker, John Kremner, and Henry Saunders Bury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much-loved former Bolton bar owner Pedro Cuadrado, who died in 2010, was also conscripted into the Republican army fighting General Franco as a teenager living near Barcelona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 2,500 men and women from Britain volunteered to fight in the war, 536 of whom were killed in action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Croft's grandfather, Archibald Williams, was also an International Brigadier and was imprisoned during the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;You don't really associate Britain with the Spanish Civil War at all, it is almost like an unwritten part of history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to encourage people to learn more about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These brave people from Bolton and across the country went to Spain as volunteers to fight fascism. They left their families and their jobs, they gave up a lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When my grandfather came back he wasn't allowed to fight in World War Two because he was seen as a trouble-maker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Watermillock in Astley Bridge was a large colony where Basque refugee children stayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers refurbished the building to prepare for the arrival of the children, who were welcomed off their coaches from Southampton by a crowd of around 400 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manchester and Lancashire produced some of the most successful aid movements during the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight fully-equipped ambulances were sent to Spain from the region, thanks to the fundraising efforts of local groups including the Clarion Cycle Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adlington was also the scene of an internment camp for Spanish prisoners during World War Two.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Tennessee towns are preparing for upcoming White Lives Matter rally protests hosted by a group of white nationalist organizations that were part of deadly August 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Event organizers applied for permits to host back-to-back demonstrations on October 28 in Shelbyville and nearby Murfreesboro on October 28.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">League of the South member Brad Griffin, who is helping organize the event, said the Shelbyville rally will be a three-hour event from 10am to 1pm, The Tennessean reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally in Murfeesboro is not expected to begin until 4pm outside of the Rutherford County Courthouse.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the groups rallying as part of Nationalist Front are the National Socialist Movement, the Traditionalist Worker Party, League of the South and Vanguard America, The Tennessean reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of those organizations is considered to be a hate group and fall under neo-Nazi, neo-Confederate and white nationalist categories by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nationalist Front planned the events as the first of many anti-immigration rallies in the area.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin told the Daily News Journal &nbsp;the demonstrations are intended to bring attention to the deadly shooting at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragic incident left one dead and another six injured when 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson, who moved to the United States from Sudan in 1996, opened fire during the end of the service police say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin said they're additionally protesting the 'resettlement of refugees and a demographic transformation of Middle Tennessee.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of the event have also said the demographics of Middle Tennessee have changed over the years mainly due to the resettlement of refugees and other immigrants moving to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly 18,000 refugees have settled in Tennessee over the last 15 years, the State Department reported. &nbsp;That number does not include those who have immigrated to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There has been a big dumping of refugees all over the area,' Griffin told The Tennessean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prepare for the rally, Shelbyville's city council passed a resolution last week committing to support efforts by police to keep people and property safe.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Streets will also be closed in an effort to separate protesters with clashing views to try and stop violence and property damage.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shelbyville police have reached out for additional assistance for Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear if white nationalist Richard Spencer will be in attendance at the rallies in Tennessee. Last week he gave a speech at the University of Florida in Gainesville where over 500 police officers worked to keep the peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That speech was his first since participating in the Charlottesville 'Unite the Right' rally. Hundreds protested against Spencer during his speech and outside of the venue. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen people have been arrested in Serbia and Croatia after dozens of migrants were smuggled across the border into the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgrade said the arrests followed months of co-operation between police in Serbia, which is not a member of the 28-country bloc, and authorities in Croatia, which is. The effort is part of a drive to quell rising flows of illegal migration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from the Serbian interior ministry said: &quot;It is suspected that this criminal group facilitated the illegal crossing of the border and transit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to a total of 82 migrants from Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq.&quot; Migrants were apparently charged (EURO)1,500 each to make the journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities said that the &quot;criminal network's&quot; hub was based in Serbia, with 13 of the smugglers - including 12 Serbs and one Afghan - arrested in the capital, Belgrade, and four towns along the country's northern frontiers with the EU states Hungary and Croatia. The remaining four were detained in Croatia. It was unclear whether the smugglers were part of a larger Balkan network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrests come amid heightened efforts to stop thousands of migrants stranded in Serbia from braving border runs into EU member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The so-called Balkan migration route was sealed last year after states in the region beefed up border controls and the EU signed a deal with Turkey. The agreement dramatically reduced illegal inflows but left nearly 5,000 refugees trapped in squalid state-run camps in Serbia. Hundreds more remain scattered across the country in Belgrade and towns along the frontiers with Croatia, leaving refugees - mainly from Afghanistan and Pakistan - sleeping rough and exposed to harsh weather conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smugglers snare them with promises to guide the desperate migrants into neighbouring Croatia and the heavily guarded Hungary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Serbia's migration crackdown, experts say that many refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia continue to make their way into Serbia through Bulgaria. More than 60,000 refugees are also trapped in Greece, highlighting the difficulties faced by Europe in its attempt to tackle the migrant crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more than 14,000 of the asylum seekers spread across five islands in the Aegean, a leading international humanitarian group accused the government on Thursday of dragging its feet in efforts to decongest overcrowded state-run refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Greek government committed in early December to moving 5,000 asylum seekers from the islands to the mainland as an emergency measure, before the onset of winter,&quot; Human Rights Watch said in a statement. &quot;Despite [some] transfers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the camps on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros, and Kos still have almost 11,000 people in facilities with a total capacity of just 5,576.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aid group labelled the government's pledge to ease overcrowded conditions a &quot;half measure that leaves thousands of other refugees stuck in the cold&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Spyros Galinos, the mayor of Lesbos, filed a suit with the government accusing it of criminal negligence and mismanagement of a state camp on the island housing four times more migrants than its 1,500 initial capacity. &quot;This is a tragedy waiting to happen,&quot; Mr Galinos said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">970 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month Austria became the only western European country with a far-right presence in government after Sebastian Kurz, of the conservative Austrian People's party (&Ouml;VP), struck a deal with the Freedom party (FP&Ouml;), a nationalist group founded after the second world war by former members of the Nazi party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austrians who replied to a Guardian callout say they are outraged by the move and fear the coalition may legitimise far-right sentiment, and increase divisions in society. Anna Labner, 28, a science student living in Vienna, who voted for the Green party in the last general election, says she is deeply worried by the new government. Although she would like to see the FP&Ouml; banned, she says doing so would result in a constitutional crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am sure that if this coalition had been inaugurated one or two years ago, there would have been more uproar. But Donald Trump has stirred up so much sensationalism that I have become a bit numb to all the ways I have to worry about our society going downhill,&quot; she says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a fear among many respondents that the &Ouml;VP has swung to the right. They say it has jumped on anti-immigration and anti-refugee sentiment to win votes. At 31, Kurz is the youngest head of government in the world and voters who responded to our callout say they are wary of his motives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The &Ouml;VP, with its young and populist right leader, has appropriated most of the FP&Ouml;'s ideas, only stopping short of the party's traditional closeness with neo-Nazi groups. The &Ouml;VP is not grudgingly forming a coalition government with the FP&Ouml; out of lack of alternatives; they are happily joining forces,&quot; says Labner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kurz's &Ouml;VP won 32% of the vote in October's elections, securing 62 seats in the 183-seat national council. The FP&Ouml; came third with 26% of the vote and 51 seats. The last time the party entered a coalition government, in 2000, the move was met with sanctions and outrage from Israel and across the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clemens Schwan, 29, who works for a non-governmental organisation in Berlin, says that despite the FP&Ouml; and &Ouml;VP campaigning for those &quot;left behind&quot; they will have a devastating effect on social investment, housing and the wider economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the FP&Ouml; joined government for the first time in 2000, the EU marginalised Austria and withdrew its right to vote on EU issues. It is sad to see the European commission congratulating this government. We need a new pan-European coalition against rightwing populist parties in EU governments,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the respondents say the two main parties - the Social Democrats (SP&Ouml;) and the &Ouml;VP - are to blame for failing to sensibly address voters' fears. Ingrid Haunold, a freelance writer from Vienna, voted for the new List Pilz, a party founded by a former Green parliamentarian, which entered parliament for the first time after the last election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Austria took in many refugees, as we should have, but the government did not do enough to ease people's fears in regard to cultural and religious differences between mostly Catholic Austrians and the newly arrived, mostly Muslim, refugees,&quot; she says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doris Schneidtinger, a film industry professional and volunteer refugee worker who took part in protests on Monday, says the mood on the street is changing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A few months ago people thought [negatively] about refugees, foreigners, LGBTQ [people] ... of course, but they often didn't say it out loud. In the last few days, friends of mine from Iraq or Afghanistan have experienced being spat at in a bus, being called 'damned refugees' in the underground,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students, feminists and anti-fascist groups took to the streets this week in protest. People held placards reading &quot;Refugees welcome&quot;, &quot;Nazis out&quot; and &quot;No Nazi pigs&quot;. But although many respondents said they had attended protests, turnout was weaker than hoped. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many respondents like Sabina, a project manager living in Vienna, say the numbers are not indicative of the public mood. She says she, and many of her friends, are taking their protest to social media. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea of taking it to the street is also futile; it won't improve anything. The trust is already broken and all a large-scale protest could achieve is more instability in the capital. The ones who have influence should be taking action. However, the president approved the coalition so our No 1 hope is gone,&quot; she says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schneidtinger agrees that the protest should continue online, and long after this week. &quot;You can keep your eyes open and confront people if you witness racist assaults ... protest like this is just as important if not more important than demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The party has been looming over us for decades, always just not making it into the government - except for 2000, but that was very different, because the reaction of the whole world and especially the EU and also the &Ouml;VP was different,&quot; she says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone who is against the FP&Ouml; agrees that the coalition is such a disastrous move. Some respondents including Michael Haas who works at Vienna's Music and Performing Arts' University, says this is a wake-up call for the main parties, with many hoping there will be snap elections before 2021, after which a new government can be formed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After years of a paralysed grand coalition between centre right and centre left, it was unavoidable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Socialist party came second in this election and Austria has a former leader of the Green party as its president. The Greens had self-destructed. TYhe present government remains European in outlook and open in a way that the UK isn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Austria has a system of checks and balances and I do not see the country heading down the path of parties like the Front National in France or even the UK's Tory party,&quot; he says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't protest because what would have been the alternative? An extension of a dysfunctional grand coalition under a new leader?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the Australian Medical Association has said three pregnant refugees being refused terminations on Nauru must be brought to Australia for the procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors for the trio held in the offshore immigration regime have requested they be transferred to Australia to terminate their pregnancies. They have been refused by Nauru hospital's overseas medical referral (OMR) committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pregnancy terminations are illegal in devoutly Christian Nauru. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Three pregnant refugees and nearly 50 others denied medical transfers from Nauru</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Psychiatrists have raised serious concerns about the mental health of the three women, saying they fear they might self-harm, attempt suicide or attempt to terminate their pregnancy themselves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra, the AMA president Dr Michael Gannon - an obstetrician by specialty - said the case for the three women was clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ethical principles are very clear. People seeking the protection of the Australian government are entitled to healthcare standards the same as Australian citizens. So, that's a matter of ethics and that's a matter of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gannon said pregnancy terminations were &quot;a difficult and vexed issue, where a form of medical care ... which could relatively easily be provided on Nauru, can't legally be provided because it's illegal on the island&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That means that if that cannot be provided, that those patients must be transferred to the mainland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gannon said the AMA had developed a working relationship with the chief medical officer of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection that allowed it to advocate for the care of refugees and asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the subject of healthcare for refugees and asylum seekers under Australia's care on Manus Island and Nauru was &quot;a hotly contested political issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not an immigration expert. But I like to think I am expert in medical ethics and I've stated our position very clearly as to the health standard that is we would expect,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the AMA and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians have called for refugees and asylum seekers held offshore who require advanced medical treatment to be immediately brought to Australia for care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian Australia revealed this week that more than 50 people currently held on Nauru are on the OMR list. They have been recommended by doctors for transfer to Australia for required high-level care, but have either been refused, or simply not considered, by the Nauru hospital's OMR committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Catherine Yelland, the president of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, said: &quot;We are very concerned by reports that asylum seekers are being refused medical transfers to hospitals in Australia where they would be able to get the care they need. The Australian government has a responsibility to ensure people in detention have access to the same level of care in Australian hospitals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yelland said the college had long held the position that indefinite, mandatory immigration detention should end and asylum seekers should live in the community while their claims are assessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's abundantly clear that they can't receive the quality healthcare they need in these facilities. Doctors' advice in these instances must be followed. We've too often seen the tragic outcomes that can occur when this advice is ignored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven refugees and asylum seekers have died in offshore detention. Medical neglect - including urgent transfer requests being rejected or ignored, poor treatment being provided, or people being refused treatment - has contributed to deaths, coronial inquiries have been told and staff have consistently reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guardian Australia revealed that a changed policy directive from the Australian immigration department had led to a significant backlog of medical cases on Nauru. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nauru hospital's OMR committee has, for several years, played a role in international transfers, but previously, urgent or sensitive medical transfers were arranged directly between Australian Border Force and its health contractor, International Health and Medical Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Hamid Kehazaei inquest exposes failures of Australia's secretive immigration regime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However since the middle of July, the Australian immigration department has mandated that all medical transfers - including requests for terminations of pregnancies - must be approved by Nauru's OMR. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is significant medical disquiet over pregnancy terminations being referred to the OMR committee. The hospital is essentially being asked to approve a procedure overseas that is illegal in Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff on the island say the committee has been placed in an invidious position on terminations and that those procedures should be directly arranged between IHMS and the ABF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other surgeries and medical treatments are also delayed. The OMR committee meets irregularly - it has postponed two meetings this week, department staff in Canberra say - keeps little paperwork, and repeatedly defers decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff on Nauru and in Canberra say the changed policy has been designed to frustrate or stop medical transfers. They argue the OMR provides no clinical value and only delays people receiving appropriate care. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANGELA Merkel has threatened Hungary with expulsion form the EU over its refusal to adhere to Brussels' refugee allocation scheme. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Merkel says Hungarian PM Viktor Orban's refusal to take refugees was &quot;unacceptable&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German Chancellor, who has faced criticism over her own open door policy on asylum seekers, said the country's refusal to comply with a European Court of Justice ruling risked Budapest's continued membership of the bloc.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to Berliner Zeitung on Tuesday, Ms Merkel said it was &quot;unacceptable&quot; of Budapest to reject the ECJ's dismissal of its legal challenge against the EU scheme.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary and Slovakia had tried to overturn the union's 2015 plan to relocate more than 160,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece across all 28 member states.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the case was dismissed by ECJ judges on Wednesday, who ruled that the allocations were &quot;proportionate&quot; and upheld the EU's initial plans.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  EU threatens Hungary with court as Orban slams ECJ refugee ruling  Hungary furious at &quot;politically motivated interference&quot; by MEPs </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, all of which backed the challenge, are now legally obliged to take in an allocation of refugees as required by Brussels.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Hungarian government is furious with the ECJ's decision and refused to co-operate.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungarian Foreign Minister P&eacute;ter Szijj&aacute;rt&oacute; told a press conference after the ruling that politics had &quot;raped European law and values&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ruling issued by the European Court of Justice in the migrant quota case is appalling and irresponsible,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real battle has only just begun.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German chancellor suggested Hungary's stance raised &quot;fundamental questions&quot; about EU membership </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far Hungary is yet to admit a single refugee from its 1,294 EU quota. Slovakia has only accepted 16 from the 902 asylum seekers it was accorded.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ms Merkel told the German newspaper: &quot;When a government ignores a ruling by the European Court of Justice, that is unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when asked if the row could ultimately result in Hungary's dismissal from the EU, she did not rule it out.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation raised a &quot;fundamental question&quot; about an integrated Europe, Ms Merkel said, describing the bloc as having &quot;a common area of justice&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the issue would be raised at the European Council in October.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Commission is currently pressing ahead with a series of infringement proceedings against Hungary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also launched a legal case against Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic for refusing to take in migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference in Brussels last week, EU migration commission Dimitris Avramopoulos said the ruling was a &quot;very clear&quot; message to the countries resisting its refugee allocation scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not changed our political position, it's very very clear. It is mandatory and the messages were very clear from the very beginning,&quot; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So member states are obliged legally and politically, even morally, to do their part of sharing in a responsible way the principle of solidarity in practice.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the member states that have not relocated at all do not change their approach in the coming weeks we should therefore consider to take the last step in the infringement procedure and refer Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the ECJ.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is still best known in Britain for filling the turbine hall of Tate Modern with millions of &quot;sunflower seeds&quot; for a 2010 exhibition. These seeds all looked identical but actually were all hand-made, tiny pieces of porcelain with their own little grooves and idiosyncrasies. It is easy to be reminded of these seeds in his epic new feature documentary, Human Flow. The film, shot in 23 countries, has several high angle shots of men, women and children in tented villages, or in boats, or in long files, walking down endless roads. They are among the 65 million refugees in the world today who have been forcibly displaced from their homes. In Human Flow, Ai Weiwei is telling some of their stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking the day after the world premiere at the Venice Festival, the 60-year-old Berlin-based artist proves a disconcerting interviewee. Before you can ask a question, he takes your photograph. He doesn't ask for permission and he doesn't explain his reasons for doing so. He's softly spoken and thoughtful in his responses to questions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow, Ai Weiewei explains, began in very modest fashion. He likes to tackle new projects from a position of near ignorance; to &quot;come from zero&quot;, as &quot;innocent as a new born person&quot;. In this case, he had visited the Greek island of Lesbos with his son. They were on holiday when he saw scenes that rendered him speechless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are on this beautiful beach and then you see a dinghy boat, peacefully approaching the port right in front of us. I turned on my iPhone camera and started filming. What I saw was shocking and unbelievable - a baby being handed out (of the dinghy), women climbing out. There was nobody there to receive them. I started to hear their stories. They had to walk 70 hours to reach the point where they can register. They sleep on the road. They are sitting in the rain. That made me so curious. They (the refugees) are proud people. They have dignity. They're not beggars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene was like something &quot;out of cinema, not real life&quot;. The refugees arriving on the beach didn't speak the same language as the Greeks and couldn't communicate with them. It was as if they had arrived from Mars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei tried to make sense of what he was seeing but was too &quot;badly equipped&quot; to do so. He was, though, intensely curious. He comes from China, a &quot;communist country&quot; with limited horizons. He had grown up with little material wealth and with severe restrictions on freedom of expression. His father, the poet Ai Qing, had been badly mistreated during the Cultural Revolution and forced to spend 20 years in exile &quot;in a very remote area&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, here he was, in western Europe, in the cradle of ancient civilisation, watching people who had given up their homes to travel to somewhere &quot;totally foreign&quot;. He wanted to know why. &quot;So that started the film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei's method of telling the refugees' stories was pragmatic. He began by &quot;documenting the situation&quot;, and slowly planned his film, as his knowledge developed. He has made many art documentaries and human rights films that he shot &quot;guerrilla warfare&quot; style, posting them online so they could be seen immediately, but this was on an altogether grander scale. &quot;I am very used to it, very skilful at that, but to do a documentary to cover such a complex story???&quot; his voice tails off as he contemplates how daunting the task was. He was covering many different stories, some stretching back for generations (for example, the Gaza scenes) and some about refugees who have only very recently left their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation of his subjects was changing all the time. He needed to come up with a structure that would allow him to deal with so many shifting perspectives. That is where the idea of human flow came in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in his own career, Ai Weiwei's situation was the polar opposite of those whose stories he tells. As a dissident artist in China, he spent time under house arrest and had his passport confiscated. He wasn't allowed to leave home. In Human Flow, he is following subjects who've been forced to leave home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does being deprived of the freedom to travel compare to having to travel in order to survive? It's a question he has asked himself. When he was growing up with his father in exile, his father told him to imagine that he had been born in the remote town where they were living. That was the best way of coping with the dislocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when refugees are accepted in a new community, they will rarely feel they belong. &quot;If a plant had been cut off like this, it would die. As humans, they have a very strong surviving nature. But, still, they will live in darkness for their whole life. Don't have the illusion they come for an economic reason,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody, for an economic reason, will risk their life.&quot; He tells heartbreaking stories about parents who send their children away to give them a better chance to survive. &quot;The boat comes down and you see people holding children who have no parents because they can't afford to pay the smugglers. They let the children go first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a touching and very intimate moment in Human Flow in which Ai Weiwei cuts a refugee's hair. Wherever he went, he tried to show what he calls &quot;the human touch&quot;. The documentary captures the monotony of his subjects' lives: Their desperate quest to keep their phones dry and charged; their constant waiting; their anxiety; their desire to &quot;fix up a little bit&quot;. Cutting their hair helped with that - and besides, it was something he was good at. If he wasn't an artist and filmmaker, Ai Weiwei could probably have made a living as a barber. &quot;I've done haircuts for people since I was very young because we had no money. I had to cut for classmates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are &quot;proud people&quot;, he says. &quot;They have dignity. They are not beggars. They come to survive. They are not asking for mercy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei was always struck by how these refugees would offer him food, although they had very little themselves. &quot;If you eat it, they have such a joy. You are part of them. What is humanity? Humanity means we identify each other through our actions.&quot; Sharing a meal, he suggests, is an expression of this humanity. &quot;It is in our blood, beyond our knowledge, beyond our wisdom. We have the same body temperature. We use eyes to look basically at the same images. When we are hungry and cold, we feel the same,&quot; he describes the links between the refugees and anyone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow clearly cost a small fortune to make. Ai Weiwei made it in collaboration with big US film companies like Participant and Lionsgate. The starting point was just him and his camera. From there, the project grew and grew in scope.&quot;I tried to get as much knowledge about the topic as possible. It is a joy to learn. During the development, some investors heard of our topic, knew we were in need and moved in.&quot; He accepted their support but insisted on complete creative freedom. He believes these companies were as determined as he was to &quot;help the people in need&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a beautiful but very haunting shot in the film of a pile discarded life jackets. It can't help but make you think of photographs of abandoned suitcases belonging to victims of the Holocaust. The image makes you pause, though. You wonder how Ai Weiwei reconciles his obvious desire to create striking and beautiful images at the same time that he is recording the horrific experiences of the refugees. Ask about this and he responds that he was determined to provide &quot;beauty in the most difficult situations; in tragedy and in crisis... That beauty is brutal because it is very indifferent,&quot; the artist concludes on a very sombre note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei will participate in a panel discussion, hosted by Jon Snow and including special guests, broadcast live from Milton Court Concert Hall, London to more than 200 cinemas across the UK and Ireland following simultaneous screenings of 'Human Flow' on Monday. 'Human Flow' is released on Friday 8 December (humanflow.film)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Conor Riordan, Press Association Scotland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interpreters for Syrian refugees should be given psychological support as a ``priority'' due to the stress the work causes, according to a study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers looked at how the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme (SVPRP) was rolled out in Edinburgh, as a way to provide guidance for other authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcoming arrangements were found to have exceeded the expectations of refugees, however concerns were raised about support given to interpreters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper highlights how the workers were often the ``only available staff'' to families, which saw them build close relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interpreters reported breaking into tears during meetings and suffering bouts of depression as a result of what they were dealing with, often providing help out-of-hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NHS Lothian consultant Dermot Gorman, co-author of study, said: ``It's always variable with each worker, each one has a different approach, but some would be going out on a Saturday evening to put in papers for appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It could be stressful for interpreters. They were hearing stories that perhaps had resonance with their own lives.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the interpreters said in the study: ``I just feel down and depressed because every day you are hearing what they've been through and it brings back memories to me, because we've been through this as well in my country - I was crying with them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another added: ``I've done quite a lot of work with the police, hospitals and courts, but the fact that you establish a relationship with the families, things affect you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SVPRP is a programme which commits the UK Government to resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further 3,000 from the Middle East North Africa region are to be brought to the country through the Vulnerable Children Relocation Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was announced on Monday, December 18, that Scotland had taken in its target of 2,000 refugees three years ahead of schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Gorman said the programme has been largely successful and was confident the country could take in more of those in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems identified include language problems for the new arrivals and difficulties with navigating NHS services, which led to them using interpreters as a first point-of-call for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SVPRP: Evaluation of Edinburgh's Reception Arrangements study focused on the city as it was one of the first in Scotland to take in large numbers through the resettlement scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It reviewed the successes and downfalls of the programme through the experience and opinions of interpreters during 2015 and 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns over worker stress resulted in the study, led by the University of Edinburgh's Katherine Weir, calling on a number of recommendations to be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its conclusion it said psychological support for them should be ``prioritised''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counselling is available for staff, but the paper said its availability should be reinforced in training for interpreters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds that management should consider the workers' own histories when giving them jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings, published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health, have been fed back to City of Edinburgh Council and NHS Lothian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Alison McCallum, NHS Lothian's director of public health and public policy, said: ``We are committed to ensuring all our staff, especially those who experience stressful situations through their work, have access to a range of occupational health support services to help them deal with stress and trauma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``These services are made available to all our staff, including our interpreters, so that they are able to seek help when they need it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A City of Edinburgh Council spokeswoman said: ``We encourage all staff who encounter stress in their role to come forward and access the various support networks we have in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are aware of the report and will be considering whether it has any further implications for the support we give our interpreters.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last, devastating memory Rohingya teenager Janata Begum has of her mother is when a Burmese soldier hacked her to death with a machete as she could not run from their family home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janata, 15, and her brother Habib, 12, already fatherless, were forced to leave their disabled mother behind when the military attacked their village in Buthidaung, in Burma's northern Rakhine state, burning down homes and shooting civilians, one early evening in late August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children hid with neighbours in the forest for 15 days, inching their way towards safety in neighbouring Bangladesh through bursts of gunfire that felled people around them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were starving and we slept on the muddy ground in the rain and got bitten by lice. Sometimes the water rose up to our necks,&quot; Janata told the Telegraph.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They arrived heartbroken and distraught in the fastest growing refugee camp in the world, located near Cox's Bazar, southern Bangladesh, and which has officially absorbed 624,000 Muslim Rohingya refugees, but more likely closer to 700, 000, since the military operation began on August 25.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the sprawling, dusty Kutupalong and Balukhali adjoining refugee camps, where 58 per cent of the inhabitants are children, orphans can easily be lost in the throng. Worse, they are vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and trafficking. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma and Bangladesh are currently forming a negotiating team to thrash out the details of a pact agreed in late November to repatriate the bulk of the refugees within the next two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many families who are trying to sort through the wreckage of their lives and still looking for lost relatives, torn apart during the chaotic flight from an ethnic cleansing campaign by the Burmese military, cannot even begin to contemplate returning yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations this week said they could not rule out that genocide had been committed and called for the perpetrators to be subject to an international criminal trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN claims that the Rohingya have been fleeing mass atrocities by Burmese government security forces including murder, rape and arsonCredit:      Heathcliff O'Malley     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trauma of bereaved children, many of whom have witnessed the slaughter of their parents and have no home to go back to, will be a lasting legacy of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to UN figures, close to 19,000 children have arrived in Bangladesh since August without their parents, although the actual figure may be higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 5,200 of these children have no relatives to care for them at all, creating &quot;child-headed&quot; households where teenagers look after younger siblings. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janata and Habib, whose names have been changed to protect their identities,&nbsp;found their paternal uncle through a tracing programme set up by Save the Children, which so far has reunited 24 children with their parents and 27 with other relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager said she was &quot;happy&quot; to have found him but she still feels bereft in the vast camp where food is scarce and she can no longer pursue her goal to be a seamstress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many children, haunted by atrocities they saw in Burma, are still longing to find loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jane Alam, 12, is trying to locate his mother, who he last saw on a beach as he and his three younger siblings and grandparents scrambled onto a boat to cross the Naf River by night into Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought she was right behind us so we didn't worry at first,&quot; he said. But his mother had disappeared. Having lost his father at sea eight years ago when he attempted to reach Malaysia, Jane now cares for his younger brothers and sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He finds some relief at a British-funded &quot;Child Friendly Space&quot; run by UN children's charity, Unicef, where children can play and talk through their distress with trained counsellors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he first arrived, his drawings of helicopters firing on burning houses revealed more than his words about the savagery he had witnessed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he smiles, interacts with other children and prefers to draw flowers, but his pain still runs deep. &nbsp;&quot;I miss my mother very much. She's very beautiful,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case workers trying to trace her do not want to tell Jane that they have no leads, but like many Rohingya children, he has already aged well beyond his years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think she has been killed by the military,&quot; he said matter-of-factly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies are working round the clock to contain the evolving crisis, and its scale is hard to grasp. In just three months, a destitute tent city the size of 2,300 football pitches, with a population greater than Washington DC, has sprung up across barren, unstable terrain and is still growing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of fleeing Rohingya remain stuck on the Burmese side of the border, with a steady trickle still managing to cross. Saiful, 30, who arrived last Thursday said military violence in Rakhine was ongoing. His uncle, Abu Jafar, had been shot in Puimali village only ten days before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers privately dismiss plans to quickly repatriate refugees as a political smokescreen, racing instead to save lives in an ongoing health and nutritional emergency. Doctors are working daily to avert a cholera timebomb and to immunise young children from deadly bouts of measles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malnutrition rates were &quot;alarming&quot; among Rohingya children, said World Food Programme spokesperson Shelley Thakral. One in four children under five are affected, with 7.5 per cent of them &quot;severe&quot; cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the multiple feeding stations providing lifesaving nutrition, dehydrated babies stare listlessly into space. Meanwhile, more than 60 per cent of the camp's water supply is contaminated with bacteria from temporary latrines, fuelling over 36,000 cases of acute watery diarrhea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to imagine more miserable living conditions. Yet Bangladesh, which has been praised for its generosity towards such a large influx of refugees, was also criticised last week for reviving a &pound;200m project to house 100,000 on an isolated, flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Nicola Smith (@niccijsmith) November 28, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the threat of exile to a remote island and the desperation of camp life, few refugees interviewed were willing to return to Burma under the current circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nir Ahmed, 65, first fled to Bangladesh in 1978 when 200,000 Rohingya were driven out of Burma by a similar brutal military operation. He stayed for six months, but this time he only wants to return if the Rohingya are given citizenship rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are very worried about the [repatriation] agreement. We suspect they will take us back to Burma and put us in camps,&quot; he said. &quot;I would rather tell Bangladesh just to kill us here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of Rohinghya Muslims fleeing the violence in Myanmar is now beyond 120,000, the UN reports, and thousands are still trying to make it across the border to Bangladesh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Images taken at the border show women and young children swimming across the river Naf which separated Rakhine state in Myanmar, and Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents wade through the river with their children on their shoulders, while older siblings to their best to balance what belongings they have managed to salvage before fleeing their homes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, once they arrive at one of the refugee camps in Bangladesh, they may face being turned away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR) has warned that established camps are beyond capacity, as the number of displaced people swell beyond 123,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The numbers are very worrying. They are going up very quickly,' said UNHCR spokeswoman Vivian Tan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency was pleading for assistance, saying it needed more land so it could set up new camps to accommodate refugees who were arriving hungry, traumatized and in need of medical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Most have walked for days from their villages - hiding in jungles, crossing mountains and rivers with what they could salvage from their homes,' the agency said in a statement. 'An unknown number could still be stranded at the border.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya Muslims have long faced discrimination in the majority-Buddhist Southeast Asian country, with tensions flaring on several occasions in recent years following violent riots in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest round of violence erupted on August 25, when Rohingya militants attacked remote police posts, killing 15 officials and burning villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar's army chief has said nearly 400 people have died since then, including 370 Rohingya militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya however, say Myanmar soldiers and local ethnic Burmese mobs have been killing at random, and setting fire to villages to 'cover their tracks'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, a Rohingya Muslim whom The Associated Press reached by phone said she and thousands of fellow villagers driven from their homes by the violence in Myanmar are now stuck along the coast, hoping to flee to nearby Bangladesh by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 18-year-old provided AP with mobile phone photographs she took Tuesday along the beach in southern Maungdaw township in Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of the photos show hundreds of people sitting on the ground, with small sacks or plastic bags holding their meager belongings. Only some had tarps or umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for her safety, said her family's house was burned on August &nbsp;25, right after Rohingya insurgents attacked Myanmar border guard police outposts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager said that since the attacks, Rohingya from Myin Hlut and surrounding villages fled as the army burned houses. Initially they fled into nearby forests, she said, but they moved to the beach in hopes of making it clear to the army that they are not insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she and other villagers reached the beach four days ago and lack adequate food and drinking water. She said villagers have been drinking salty water from the Bay of Bengal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Myanmar soldiers come to the beach two or three times a day to check on the displaced villagers. The Rohingya are barred from returning to their villages, she said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that boats from Bangladesh have come near the shore every day to take villagers north to Bangladesh, and that the price is 150,000 kyats (&pound;85) per person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The villager said she didn't know where the boats end up, but that she and her family will try to get onto one if there is a chance for them to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the photos she took shows about a dozen small wooden boats in the background. Many boats along the shore are owned by Rohingya fishermen, but the government has banned them from using them for many months.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Step into the footsteps of Syrian refugees in an exhibition now showing at Nottingham's New Art Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fleeing war torn countries, the past two years has seen 1.3 million people travelling through Greece in search of safety and a better life in Europe. Their fearful and arduous journey is the subject of a new exhibition at New Art Exchange by Juan delGado, Altered Landscapes, presenting a refugees' experience in a way usually unseen in mainstream media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From ports, to motorways, to borders of barbed wire and cameras, the route to safety spans many landscapes. In early 2016, artist Juan delGado travelled to Greece, Macedonia and Calais and recorded the journeys taken by refugees, many of whom are from Syria and northern Iraq. delGado recalls their stories and experiences within Altered Landscapes in his film installations, photography and audio works, making for an insightful and thought-provoking exhibition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2013, he has collected stories and testimonies from those on the run, internally displaced or re-settling across Europe in his online archive Qisetna: Talking Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curator Armindokht Shooshtari explains the importance of representing refugees' experiences at New Art Exchange - a Nottingham-based gallery celebrating cultural diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are so pleased to present this important exhibition, which comes at a time when many European countries are fortifying their borders with wire fences and watchtowers to stop the flow of refugees. We hope the exhibition helps in telling the human story of many people caught in the worst humanitarian crisis of our time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of visually depicting displaced people - familiar images which already proliferate the media - delGado chose to capture the traces of their existence: the fleeting moments and marks left on the land as they pass through. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shot with beautiful black and white cinematography, the visuals are accompanied by a heartfelt narrative, describing the traumatic experience of uprooting and leaving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">behind loved ones without knowing if they will be reunited once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juan delGado describes his intentions in creating this exhibition in the midst of the largest mass migration in living history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This exhibition comes as a result of an on-going journey of listening to the traumatic experiences of hundreds of men and women that I have met since 2012. They were trying to understand, not only the tragic situation they have been thrown into, but also the suppurating hopelessness as they enquiry us &quot;why the world is ignoring our suffering?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is said that art can't change the world, even it is not the purpose of art to change anything. However, it is through the making of this work that I can finally come to terms with what it is unrepresentable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the installation, a floor projection shows a terrain underfoot, offering an intimate and personal experience of walking through an unfamiliar landscape. A series of landscape photographs sets the scene for their accompanying audio recordings, telling stories from refugees who delGado met during the making of his exhibition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition runs until August 6. New Art Exchange is situated on Gregory Boulevard in Nottingham city centre. For more, see www.nae.org.uk </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't hope for much anymore. But I didn't think we'd lose everything again,&quot; said Bardah, originally from Deir Ezzour in Syria, her grandchild on one hip and gesturing around the burnt out remains of Qab Elias camp with the other. &quot;But here we are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon is only half the size of Wales, and has a population of four million. It is currently home to an estimated 1.5 million Syrians who have fled over the border in the last six years of civil war, making around one in four people a refugee. The conditions for most, however, are abysmal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee response in Lebanon is no longer in the emergency stages -but two huge fires that ripped through Qab Elias and Mar Elias settlements earlier this month have shown just how precarious existence still is for so many Syrians here, trapped in a cycle of poverty and debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have brought macro benefits in the form of international financial injections to prop up the country's antiquated water and sewage systems, as well as failing schools in rural areas which now teach more Syrian than Lebanese children. Despite the fact 71 per cent live below the poverty line,studies estimate that through the buying of goods and housingthe refugee population has actually added millions to the Lebanese economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a country with a notoriously ineffective government -public services barely function -and where unemployment rates are already high, the authorities are wary of creating incentives for Syrians to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Palestinians who fled their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War came to Lebanon, where they have been for generations: unable to claim citizenship, they are in effect second class citizens, confined to claustrophobic concrete ghettos still known as &quot;camps&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Syria's war broke out in 2011, the Lebanese government immediately outlawed the creation of official government-run camps in the hopes that the fighting would die down and Syrians would not choose to stay. The decision has made the job of aid organisations more difficult, as they must tread a line between providing the basic services Syrians need to survive, and making them -in the government's eyes -too comfortable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Lebanon's Syrian population actually lives in towns and cities -in abandoned buildings or farmsteads, or often at the mercy of landlords who threaten to expose families' unregistered status to blackmail them into paying higher rents. Most have moved into already highly overcrowded Palestinian areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Bekaa Valley, however, fields of white tents and other makeshift settlements dot the landscape. The agricultural area is one of the poorest in the country, and the 39 per cent of Syrians who live here are some of the most impoverished. &quot;We are actually lucky that fires like this don't happen more often,&quot; Utpal Moitra, Unicef's Chief Field Officer for the Bekaa and Baalbek-Hermelgovernorate said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camps most Syrians live in in the region have been built piecemeal, using whatever materials are at hand or help the UN and NGOs are able to give. As a result, many tents or semi-permanent breeze block structures are built too close together, and if they're lucky enough to have an electricity supply, the wiring is often amateur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fires are very common, usually started by faulty wiring or because families use gas canisters to cook inside their tents. Normally, however, they are contained quickly, catching maybe one or two tents at a time. In Qab Elias and Mar Elias, the July heat wave and wheat crop surrounding the sites meant the blazes had spread across almost the entire camps before fire services (run by volunteers in Lebanon) were able to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole site went up in about 10 minutes,&quot; said Lynn Bou Saba, who works for local charity World Vision at sites including Qab Elias.&quot;No one had time to think, it was just run. So many families have lost their papers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the camps are not exactly built to high quality specifications, it's not a surprise that fire safety procedures are not in place either. Qab Elias is surrounded by a ditch through which a small stream runs; when the tents first went up a few years ago, afence was put up to stop children falling into it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the fire that proved to be incredibly dangerous -there was only one gate for all 700 people to scramble through. For those furthest away, it was a challenge to reach safety through the heat and smoke. Residents said that there were a few fire extinguishers around the camp which they tried to use, but they had expired a year ago, rendering them useless as people's homes and meagre possessions were destroyed in front of their eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebuilding is already underway at a remarkable pace at both camps -and the new semi-permanent timber frame and concrete base homes, covered with tarpaulin, will be built to safer specifications. Most will even have their own latrines. &quot;In some ways it is a fresh start. But the trauma of it? A dead child? I don't think anyone here would say it was worth it,&quot; Ms Bou Saba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As some of the camp's residents took a break from rebuilding to rest in the midday sun, a van from the Lebanese Red Cross pulled up, parking near the charred remains of what was the administrative centre.Under a small gazebo for shade, several new fire extinguishers are unloaded, along with a small generator. One of the men nudges a fire extinguisher with his foot. &quot;If a fire that big breaks out again, they are probably useless to contain it,&quot; he said. &quot;But still. Like everything here, it's better than nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet detection of irregular migrants on the central Mediterranean route was at its highest level in 2016, when 181,436 people arrived in Europe by this route - an increase of 18 per cent on 2015, when the figure was 153,842.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A naval mission is the &quot;wrong tool&quot; to tackle irregular migration, which begins onshore, the assessment found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It claimed an unintended consequence of Operation Sophia's destruction of vessels had been that the smugglers have managed to adapt, sending migrants to sea in unseaworthy vessels. This led to a tragic increase in deaths, with 2,150 in 2017 to date, the report added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it also noted that Operation Sophia vessels have rescued more than 33,000 people since the start of the mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report comes just days after Amnesty International said &quot;reckless&quot; EU operations were destroying smugglers' safest boats in the Mediterranean and causing more refugee deaths. It claimed the EU had &quot;turned its back&quot; on the search and rescue strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the human rights group argued that the search-and-rescue measures implemented in 2015 dramatically decreased the numbers of deaths at sea, but that EU governments had now shifted their focus to disrupting smugglers and preventing boats departing from Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the EU strategy was &quot;exposing refugees and migrants to even greater risks at sea&quot;, destroying so many of the wooden boats used by smugglers that huge numbers of people had now started making the crossing on less safe rubber dinghies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the findings of Wednesday's report, Baroness Verma, chair of the committee, said: &quot;People smuggling begins onshore, so a naval mission is the wrong tool for tackling this dangerous, inhumane and unscrupulous business. Once the boats have set sail, it is too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Operation Sophia has failed to meet the objective of its mandate - to disrupt the business model of people smuggling. It should not be renewed. However it has been a humanitarian success, and it is critical that the EU's lifesaving search and rescue work continues, but using more suitable, non-military, vessels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Future UK and EU action should focus on tackling people smuggling in source and transit countries, and supporting sustainable economic development and good governance in these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Italy has found itself on the front line of a mass movement of people into Europe, and deserves credit for its efforts to respond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to theLords committee report, Lily Caprani, Deputy Executive Director at Unicef UK, said: &quot;The Lords Committee is right to point out that we must address the underlying need for these dangerous journeys: a lack of safe and legal routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those that continue to be forced into this perilous journey include vulnerable unaccompanied children, including those trying to join their family in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UK Government must change our family reunion rules so that children don't have to travel to Europe in order to reunite with their loved ones, but can instead apply to join their family from countries outside the EU, reducing the need for dangerous journeys.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers have accused the EU of &quot;wilfully letting people drown in the Mediterranean&quot; as they face being forced to suspend rescue missions for refugees attempting the world's deadliest sea crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy is attempting to impose a code of conduct on NGOs operating ships in the search and rescue zone off the coast of Libya, which is now the main launching point for migrants trying to reach Europe on smugglers' boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian groups have argued the code will impede their work by banning the transfer of refugees to larger ships, which allows vessels to continue rescues, and forcing them to allow police officers on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Code of conduct for refugee rescue ships 'threatens lives'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A revised code of conduct is expected to be presented by the Italian interior ministry on Monday, following meetings between officials and NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 11-point plan, which has been approved by the European Commission and border agency Frontex, could see any groups refusing to sign up denied access to Italian ports or forbidden from carrying out rescues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are currently deployed by officials at Rome's Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centre (MRCC) and charities fear any move to restrict their operations, leaving just Italian coastguard and naval ships, will dramatically reduce rescue capacity during peak season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libyan Coast Guard puts refugees and rescuers in danger during rescue operation at sea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German charity Sea-Watch announced the deployment of a second rescue vessel in response to the plans, which it called a &quot;desperate reaction&quot; by a country abandoned on the frontline of the refuge crisis by its European allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The EU is wilfully letting people drown in the Mediterranean by refusing to create a legal means of safe passage and failing to even provide adequate resources for maritime rescue,&quot; said CEO Axel Grafmanns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NGOs are currently bearing the brunt of the humanitarian crisis and they are being left alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8203;</SPAN>M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res(MSF), which has staff on two rescue ships, said it was engaging with Italian authorities in an &quot;open and constructive way&quot; over the proposed code but had serious concerns over several clauses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MSF employees are humanitarian workers, not police officers, and that for reasons of independence they will do what is strictly requested by the law but nothing more so as to protect our independence and neutrality,&quot; a spokesperson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MSF's search and rescue operations have always been conducted in respect of national and international laws and under coordination of the MRCC in Rome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity opposed a commitment compelling vessels to notify multiple states if they leave designated search and rescue zones, which it said could cause deaths by delaying rescues, and said the ability to transfer migrants to larger ships and continue operations was &quot;crucial to saving lives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The inefficient back and forth of all rescue ships to disembarkation points will consequently lead to a decrease in the presence of rescue vessels,&quot; a MSF spokesperson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is also seeking assurances on the scope of the requirement to allow police on board, which it said could prevent victims of torture, human trafficking and sexual violence coming forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International characterised the code of conduct as part of a &quot;concerted smear campaign&quot; against NGO rescue ships, which has culminated in a far-right group calling itself Defend Europe sending its own vessel to &quot;monitor&quot; operations in the Mediterranean Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right-wing politicians have made persistent claims that aid agencies are aiding or even directly colluding with Libyan smugglers without citing evidence, despite inquiries and academic studies finding no evidence of misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories of the refugees rescued from the Mediterranean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate came as smugglers continued to launch boats into the Central Mediterranean, where almost 2,400 men, women and children have lost their lives so far this year, including 13 people found dead at the bottom of an overcrowded dinghy this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU announced (EURO)46m (&pound;41m) extra funding for Italy on Friday, to help it protect Libya's northern and southern borders and stop the flow of sub-Sahran African migrants through the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome plans to send navy vessels to Libyan waters next month to combat human smuggling, despite warnings that moves to force refugees from international waters back to a warzone is a flagrant violation of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said the initiative will &quot;reinforce Libyan sovereignty&quot;, adding that Italy would &quot;not be sending a huge fleet or air squadrons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is already furnishing Libya's coastguard, which stands accused of beating and killing migrants and attacking NGO ships, with boats and training aimed at strengthening its patrols.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU has also donated (EURO)90m (&pound;80m) to improving living conditions for migrants stranded in squalid Libyan camps, although thousands more are being held by armed gangs who control swathes of the country still engulfed in the bloody chaos that followed its civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A House of Lords report branded the EU's Operation Sophia anti-smuggling mission a &quot;failure&quot; on all counts, saying it &quot;has not in any meaningful way deterred the flow of migrants, disrupted the smugglers' networks, or impeded the business of people smuggling&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee concluded that the mission was driving refugee deaths by destroying smugglers' boats and forcing them to switch to unseaworthy dinghies, and raised concern over reports of &quot;serious abuses of the human rights of migrants by the Libyan coastguard&quot;, which is being trained by the UK and equipped by the EU as it seeks to gradually unburden itself of responsibility for rescues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has warned of widespread torture, kidnap, ransom, arbitrary detention, rape, forced labour and &quot;slave auctions&quot; in Libya, where people smugglers have set up a lucrative business in the continuing conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees interviewed by </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have told of horrific abuses at the hands of both state security forces and Libyan gangs, including seeing other migrants being beaten to death and raped, and being &quot;sold&quot; between owners until they can escape over the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study commissioned by Unicef found that most children making the crossing did not intend to travel to Europe when they left home, with the journey taking up to two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children interviewed in Italy said they fled their home countries for reasons including conflict, poverty and child marriage, frequently being drawn to Libya by the promise of work but finding &quot;systematic trauma and abuse&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost half of children said they were kidnapped for ransom in Libya, and a quarter held in prison without charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sol Oyuela, director of public affairs at Unicef UK, said: &quot;These devastating journeys must end and the UK Government has an opportunity to change this, by ensuring our immigration rules allow children to reunite with siblings, grandparents and other loved ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 113,000 migrants have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, with most of the 95,000 reaching Italy coming from countries including Bangladesh, Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African nations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the expiry date of his UK visa approached, Abdullah*, who is gay, faced a choice: return to Saudi Arabia where he has to hide his sexuality for fear of death, or stay and claim asylum in the UK. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His decision to stay means he now has refugee status and the right to live in freedom in Britain; to his shock, it also meant he spent a month last winter being homeless in Manchester.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Asylum seekers forced into homelessness by paperwork delays, study finds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdullah had been living with his sister in Manchester for almost a year, while she studied. When he applied for asylum last November, Abdullah told the Home Office he would become homeless when his sister moved back to Saudi Arabia. Officials reassured him that he could apply for section 98 support, emergency support usually consisting of hostel accommodation and board, once she had gone. He did, but days later received a rejection for asylum support from the Home Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They promised me, when your sister leaves we will help you; they found reasons to refuse me, they refused me three times for different reasons,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdullah spent nearly a month homeless during winter in Manchester - two weeks sleeping rough and then two weeks in a night shelter - while he obtained further evidence to prove to the Home Office that he did not have any means of supporting himself. This evidence included a letter from his sister confirming that she was no longer supporting him, explanations of money loaned to him by his father to get his original visa, and receipts for everything Abdullah had spent money on in the past 11 months, to prove that none of the money he had had when he arrived in the UK was left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdullah is one of 315 asylum seekers and refugees whose cases were analysed for a report by Refugee Action released on Monday, which found the Home Office is missing its own deadlines for responding to applications for asylum support, and wrongly refusing applications for this support, leaving people destitute and homeless while they wait for their asylum claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The Guardian view on the return of the migrant boats: Europe's problem | Editorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Abdullah's case, Refugee Action alleges that the Home Office should have granted emergency support to Abdullah while it assessed his financial situation and eligibility for longer-term support, and that its failure to do so was directly responsible for his homelessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days before Christmas, the Home Office acknowledged that Abdullah was indeed destitute as he had originally claimed, and granted him support. He was granted refugee status on 1 April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For others featured in the Refugee Action report, such as Basirat and her sons Abdullahi, 16, and Sultan, 13, while delays in getting asylum support did not lead to homelessness, they have meant a protracted period of time spent in precarious accommodation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basirat fled Nigeria with her sons after suffering domestic violence at the hands of her brother-in-law who raped her and beat her sons. Abdullahi also endured abuse related to his cerebral palsy. While Basirat's asylum claim was processed, the family were sleeping on the floor of a damp storeroom in a privately rented house. Because they were not paying rent, the other residents of the house abused them, yelling at the boys if they used the bath or ran water for washing up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bathroom did not have a lock on the door and, in one instance, an adult visiting one of the other residents walked in on Abdullahi showering. Abdullahi, who has limited mobility and usually does not shower unassisted, says he began to panic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was very scared,&quot; said Abdullahi. &quot;I was shaking, I didn't know what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basirat applied for section 95 asylum support, which would have given her somewhere safe to live and a small allowance of &pound;36.95 per person per week. Her first claim was refused. When she applied again no response was received for six weeks, during which time the family continued to sleep on the floor of the storeroom. A Refugee Action caseworker chased up the claim with the Home Office and was told officials could not find Basirat's file on their records. In late March, three months after her initial application for support, Basirat was moved into a flat in Croydon where the family are now safe and mostly comfortable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish Home Office looked deep into asylum seekers,&quot; said Abdullah. &quot;They are leaving their countries to look for a new life, for freedom, not for sleeping in the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has refused to say if Australia is promising thousands of dollars to Rohingya refugees who agree to return to Myanmar, a country accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing against the Muslim minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told ABC's 7.30 program Australia provided settlement packages for refugees in Australian-run detention centres to return to their country of origin, and some regions of Myanmar would be safe to return to, but he would not comment on &quot;individual cases&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia offers to pay Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday up to seven Rohingya may be facing a return to Myanmar from the Australian-run detention centre on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yahya Tabani, a 32-year-old Rohingya man who arrived in Australia in 2013 but was sent to Manus Island, told Guardian Australia he had no choice but to return. He said he had been promised $25,000 by the Australian Border Force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar does not recognise the ethnic minority and has conducted military operations in Rohingya villages that the United Nations' top human rights official branded &quot;a textbook example of ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton was asked on Wednesday evening if Australia was offering Rohingya refugees $25,000 to return to Myanmar, and if he thought it was safe for them to return to the troubled country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He declined to answer the question directly, saying: &quot;If people are able to return safely back to a country of origin, or to a region of origin, then we do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When pressed by host Leigh Sales to say whether it was safe for Rohingya to return to Myanmar presently, given close to 400,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, many with bullet wounds and stories of mass killings, he said it depended on the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It depends on the in-country advice at the moment, it depends on the region where that person would want to return to, it depends on their family circumstances,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I say, in some regions people can return&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After appearing to tire of the questions, Dutton then criticised the ABC for failing to report, in its nightly news coverage, that more than 50 asylum seekers from Manus Island and Nauru would soon be settled in the United States, under a deal struck between the former US president Barack Obama and Australia to take up to 1,250 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ABC's 7pm news had reported the story, complete with a quote from Turnbull. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would have thought the ABC would be jumping up and down for joy with the fact that we've got the first 50-odd people off Manus and Nauru, people that Labor had put there, and we've not had any drownings at sea for three years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately it doesn't even make the package within the ABC news so, I mean it's a strange day, but it's a good day that we've got [some] movement [of refugees].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope that we can get more people off [the islands] and do it in a way that doesn't restart boats and that's the objective of the government,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus Island detention centre is slated for closure on 1 October and there is increasing pressure being brought to bear on refugees held there, with buildings shut, medical and other services scaled back and withdrawn, cigarettes banned, and power and water shut off, in an effort to encourage resettlement within Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nauru processing centre does not have a proposed closure date. But the president of Nauru, Baron Waqa, reaffirmed his country's position that no refugees would be allowed to permanently resettle in Nauru.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AUNG SAN SUU KYI was supposed to be addressing the United Nations, and the world, this week at the annual general assembly in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the de facto leader of Burma will give a televised speech in her own country, breaking her near-silence on the humanitarian crisis as Rohingya refugees flee violence in Burma and pour into neighbouring Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Suu Kyi's speech tomorrow will be scrutinised intensely, with the UN chief yesterday calling it her &quot;last chance&quot; to stop the bloodshed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If she does not reverse the situation now, then I think the tragedy will be absolutely horrible, and unfortunately then I don't see how this can be reversed in the future,&quot; Ant&Oacute;nio Guterres told the BBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week could prove pivotal for the crisis as Bangladeshi authorities struggle to get the refugee situation under control. More than 410,000 people from the Rohingya minority Muslim group have now crossed the border. Ms Suu Kyi's image as a human rights campaigner has been tarnished after she failed to intervene in the crackdown which started on Aug 25, when the military in Buddhist-majority Burma launched operations in Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army says its &quot;clearance operations&quot; in the area are aimed at flushing out Rohingya militants who had attacked police posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence has since engulfed the border region, with reports emerging of Rohingya villages being razed and civilians being cut down as they try to flee. The UN has branded the so-called security offensive a &quot;textbook example of ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ms Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has expressed no public concern for the Rohingya and has instead blamed &quot;terrorists&quot; for the violence, while also bemoaning &quot;a huge iceberg of misinformation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angelina Jolie, the actress and UN Special Envoy on refugees, yesterday condemned the conflict. &quot;It's absolutely clear that the violence by the army needs to stop and that the return of the refugees has to be permitted - and that the Rohingya should be given civil rights,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all wish that Aung San Suu Kyi will, in this situation, be the voice of human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Suu Kyi's party took office last year as Burma's first civilian-led government after 50 years of junta rule, but she has no power to control the army, which retains sweeping powers and controls the police and border forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's signalling that her chief priority is the relationship between the government and military and that the pogrom is secondary to that,&quot; Francis Wade, author of Myanmar's Enemy Within said of the position Ms Suu Kyi has taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, General Min Aung Hlaing, Burma's army chief, has called for a &quot;united&quot; stance in handling the crisis but gave no sign of concessions. And yesterday Burma's government hinted it may not take back Rohingya who fled across the border, accusing those refugees of having links to the militants. &quot;Those who fled the villages made their way to the other country for fear of being arrested as they got involved in the violent attacks. Legal protection will be given to the villages whose residents did not flee,&quot; the government said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts are not expecting Ms Suu Kyi to change her position in tomorrow's speech, which has to address the crisis without angering the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Depressingly, her silence about the Rohingya makes her far more popular at home,&quot; veteran journalist John Simpson wrote in an article for The Daily Telegraph. &quot;There is little or no sympathy for them among ethnic Burmese, mostly Buddhists, who form the great majority of the country's population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, Bangladeshi authorities told newly arrived Rohingya refugees that they must stay near the border - not move further into the country - and reminded Bangladeshi people they were not to rent housing to refugees. It came as aid agencies warned yesterday that Rohingyas fleeing the violence could die of starvation, exposure and dehydration as authorities began moving people to camps in order to streamline the distribution of aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people are arriving hungry, exhausted and with no food or water,&quot; Mark Pierce, Bangladesh country director for the Save the Children aid agency said. &quot;I'm particularly worried that the demand for food, shelter, water and basic hygiene support is not being met due to the sheer number of people in need. If families can't meet their basic needs, the suffering will get even worse and lives could be lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, it was confirmed that two children and a woman died in a stampede to get aid in the Cox's Bazar district, which is home to tens of thousands of Rohingyas. Heavy monsoon rain yesterday descended upon hundreds of thousands of people stuck in makeshift camps, with many refugees living on roadsides under flimsy plastic sheets. Torrential rain brought swamplike conditions to many parts of Cox's Bazar, with about three inches of rain falling in 24 hours and with more to come over the next two days.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia used Facebook events to organize anti- immigration rallies in the US, it has been reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This included one rally called 'Citizens before refugees' planned for Twin Falls, a city in Idaho, that far-right news websites had claimed was suffering from a huge influx of immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Daily Beast, the event was 'hosted' by 'SecuredBorders,' a Russian-run group with more than 133,000 'followers'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was recently shut down by the social media giant for pretending to be a 'U.S. anti-immigration community.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three hour protest event was organized for August 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said: 'We must stop taking in Muslim refugees! We demand open and thorough investigation of all the cases regarding Muslim refugees! All government officials, who are covering up for these criminals, should be fired!'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clint Watts, a former FBI agent and specialist on Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. election, told the Daily Beast: 'The objective of [Russia's] influence is to create behavior change. The simplest behavior is to have someone disseminate propaganda that Russia created and seeded. The second part of behavior influence is when you can get people to physically do something.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Facebook spokesman confirmed that the social-media giant 'shut down several promoted events as part of the takedown we described last week.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company declined to elaborate, except to confirm the events were promoted with paid adverts.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Facebook admitted selling adverts to Russian accounts trying to get Donald Trump elected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network admitted it sold &pound;77,000 of adverts to around 470 'inauthentic' accounts, roughly equivalent to 3,000 adverts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few openly discussed Mr Trump or other candidates - but most focused on divisive issues such as immigration which could have helped put Mr Trump in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum,' Facebook said in a blog post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adverts ran between June 2015 and May this year. The social media network shut down the 470 Russian accounts as soon as it found out they were fake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also found a second set of accounts, whose users appeared to be based in the US, but had their language set to Russian. These accounts spent around &pound;38,200 on another 2,200 adverts which were 'potentially political,' Facebook said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's admission has heaped fresh pressure on President Trump, who is facing huge political scrutiny - including an FBI investigation - over alleged collusion between Russia and his campaign team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The website's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has been critical of the President, and the blog post is seen as a deliberate blow against Mr Trump.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraser Nelson</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEATURES</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1182 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Angela Merkel invited refugees to Germany in 2015, tearing up the rules obliging migrants to seek asylum in the first country they arrive in, the consequences were pretty immediate. Over 160,000 went to Sweden, leading to well-publicised disruption. Next door, things were different. Norway took in just 30,000; this year it has accepted just 2,000 so far. To Sylvi Listhaug, the country's young immigration minister, this might still be a bit too much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have a big challenge now to integrate those with permission to stay in Norway to make sure they respect Norwegian values,' she says. 'Freedom to speak, to write, to believe or not to believe in a god, how to raise your children.' Also, she says, what not to do. For example: 'It is not allowed to beat your children in Norway.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unusual for a European government minister to link immigration with child-beating, but the 39-year-old Ms Listhaug is accustomed to speaking plainly. The rest of Europe, she believes, is coming around to the Norwegian position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After decades in opposition, her Progress Party entered government four years ago, junior partner in a Conservative-run coalition. Her party envisaged the problems of mass migration in the 1980s, she says, so was well ahead of the populist upstarts now haunting so much of Europe. 'A lot of them are socialist parties but against immigration. We are a libertarian party. We want less government, so people should decide more over their own life. And we want a stricter immigration policy because that's important for Norway in the long run.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Sweden and others saw the migration of 2015 as a blip caused by conflict in Syria and Iraq, she sees it as part of an irreversible demographic trend. 'Africa is going to gain almost 500 million more people by 2030,' she says. 'Much of the Middle East and Africa is fragile. People have difficult lives but can see via mobile phones that life in the West and in Europe is quite different. So I understand why they would like our life, our kind of standards. But it's not sustainable to integrate so many.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not? Norway, with its oil-generated trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund, is one of the world's richest countries - and hardly beset by integration issues. This, she says, is because they've been careful. 'Many of the jobs here today perhaps will not be here tomorrow. Working in supermarkets for example - those kind of jobs that don't need higher education. Those who come to Norway without any education - what are they going to do in the future if this continues?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a big question in Sweden, where a high (but unofficial) minimum wage has served to price immigrants out of the economy. Many of those fleeing war or poverty in Afghanistan or Somalia are denied even a secondary education, let alone a degree, making it especially hard to find work. In cities such as Malmo, police talk about a violent and jobless immigrant underworld and politicians ask if it's compassionate to leave young Afghan and Somalis in such conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case for limiting economic migration is clear. But about half of the registered asylum seekers in the EU last year were from countries that were struck by conflict. Can Norway justify taking so few? Ms Listhaug is a practising Christian (albeit sceptical of the 'thoroughly socialist' Church of Norway) and says her government's immigration policy, when combined with its aid policy, is not just a moral response, but the most effective moral response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For me it's a moral issue as well. You can't just help the ones you see. You have to think about the millions you don't see and that have a very difficult life in the world.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's referring to the refugee camps in Jordan, where both Norway and the UK send aid to help those displaced by war. Norway gave &pound;23 million to its Jordanian mission last year, almost twice as much, per capita, as Britain. The cost of helping refugees at home is taken from its foreign aid budget, so as its influx subsides and costs fall, all savings are used to help refugees abroad. Some &pound;370 million has been transferred so far, with more expected next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So to Ms Listhaug, it's not a question of whether to help refugees, but how best to do so. We meet after she visited Brandon Lewis, her British counterpart, who gave her a striking statistic: 'The immigration minister here in Britain said that for the price of helping 3,000 young people here, he could help 100,000 children in other parts of the world.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She sees this as a modern way to help asylum seekers - and more practical than the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which obliges signatories to accommodate anyone with a 'well-founded fear of persecution'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It was an agreement for its time,' she says. 'But when people travel through 20 countries to come to a safe haven, I think people can see that this is not right. You could have a safe haven in your neighbouring country, so why go so far?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western countries that define their virtue by the number of refugees they let in, she says, also face a moral question: 'Why should we have a system that works for the people who have money [to pay for the journey] while the rest of the refugees and people in need don't have the money to go?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People traffickers, she says, thrive on governments that follow the old rules and accept those who turn up on their shores. 'If you smuggle an unaccompanied minor from Afghanistan to Europe, they say it is between $3,000 and $20,000.' Young girls, she says, are sometimes sold to old men to finance such a journey. 'Also, children are killed, or raped, on their way. So we need to have this under control.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being outside the EU, Norway does have a few more controls. Sweden's foreign minister, Ann Linde, recently complained that it's easier to 'land on the moon' than trade with Norway because of the red tape. Ms Listhaug disagrees. 'We have a lot of people from Sweden coming to Norway; we are neighbours and have a good relationship,' she said. 'But of course we are a little bit concerned about the immigration policies they have. We see that they have big problems in some of the cities.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Listhaug provoked fury in Sweden a few weeks ago by visiting a suburb in Stockholm notorious for unrest among its young immigrant population. She called it a 'no-go zone' - a phrase that the Swedes angrily reject. But she doesn't seem to mind causing a fuss, especially as she thinks her critics are coming around to her way of thinking. Nor does she mind using Sweden as a case study in what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to do. 'A lot of countries in Europe are thinking more like us: like Denmark and Austria. Germany, as well... France has big problems right now with integration, as does Belgium. A lot of countries in Europe see that we need to have this under control.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her 44-year-old Danish counterpart, Inger Stojberg, is just as outspoken on integration. She recently revealed that she has the notorious </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jyllands-Posten </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">cartoon of Mohammed as the screensaver on her iPad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a simple gesture, but for frightened Syrian refugee Ahlam Hasan it meant the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No sooner had she arrived in Lancashire from her war-torn homeland than a neighbour knocked on the door and offered the young mum a cake, specially baked as a welcome present.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That changed my life and the lives of my family,&quot; said Ahlam. &quot;It just meant so much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The open arms which greeted Ahlam, her husband and three children epitomised the reception now being afforded to a host of refugees and asylum seekers in a county famous for its generosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are almost 1,200 escapees from conflict currently being supported in the comparitive safety of Lancashire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their harrowing stories are as varied as the troublespots they have fled from. But they have one thing in common - a love of their new home and the people who have welcomed them in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The response to these vulnerable people has been absolutely massive,&quot; said Saulo Cwerner, who co-ordinates the Lancashire Refugee Resettlement Programmes for the county council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be honest I couldn't have asked for any more. We are seeing an increase in the numbers staying and settling in Lancashire, so something must be going well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saulo was one of the key speakers at an asylum and refugee conference in Preston last week. It was the first of its kind in the county and the organisers were overwhelmed by the turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Red Cross worker Wonder Phiri, once an asylum seeker himself from Zimbabwe, said: &quot;Lancashire is more welcoming compared to other areas of the country - it's the culture up here in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I arrived I lived in London. But I had a few trips up north and I decided this was the place to be. It's much better, totally different to down south. The people here are more human-friendly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancashire currently hosts around 880 asylum seekers. More than 330 of those live in the Blackburn with Darwen area, but Preston has the second largest number with an estimated 176. South Ribble has just nine and Chorley 20. Lancaster is hosting 85.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saulo, who helped organise the Preston conference at the Gujurat Hindu Society and Community Centre in South Meadow Lane, said that on top of those figures the county had almost 300 people who had been supported by the Syrian Resettlement Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lancashire decided collectively to pledge to resettle up to 500 before 2020, so that's more than half our pledge already. It is going really well. We've had a really positive response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The North West as a whole does really well - figures show we have something like one third of all asylum seekers here. That has a lot to do with the housing market, because it is much more difficult to get affordable housing in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local authorities in the north tend to take the biggest numbers in the dispersal scheme. But the Government is trying to do something about that in terms of redressing the balance, although that's not likely to change in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Overall we aren't doing badly here in Lancashire. We have opened our arms to people fleeing conflict and that is something the county ought to be very proud of.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACTOR Benedict Cumberbatch considered opening his &pound;2.7million home to Syrian refugees after becoming incensed by the Government's refusal to accept them into Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sherlock star, 41, famously launched an angry tirade in 2015 after a Hamlet performance at the Barbican, blasting the Government for refusing to accept 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stunned audience members as he shouted: 'F*** the politicians!'&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when asked why he hadn't led by example and housed destitute refugees himself, he said he was just &quot;trying to raise awareness&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has now revealed he was so mad at the Government he seriously considered opening the plush doors to his home, along with wife Sophie Hunter, 39 - but changed his mind because they had a newborn baby, Christian, who is now two.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dad, who has since also had six-month-old Hal Auden, told the Big Issue: &quot;People were saying, 'You've got a home, why don't you house refugees?' And we did look into it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we had, then, a very new baby - maybe four or five months old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe people had a point. I understand why some might think I should be housing people instead of complaining about a government not doing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I was trying to raise awareness that we can do more as a society. Because I do feel we are able to do more than just recovering bodies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of his outburst he told a story of a friend who went to Greece and saw Europe's migrant crisis first hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Everywhere on the horizon there was nothing but boats and on the shoreline nothing but lifejackets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are saying, as citizens of the world, we see you... and at least some help is coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, at the premiere of his film Black Mass, he added: &quot;I don't think the government is doing enough, I'm glad to say that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, despite receiving a ton of backlash for his comments, he says he would be outspoken again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I'm a human being and it was a human crisis and I got over-excited and said things in a rather grand manner some nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cumberbatch changed his mind because he and his wife Sophie had a newborn baby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You stick your head above the parapet and that happens. But we raised money for children in need.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I don't regret doing it for a second, and I will do it again, even if it does put me in the firing line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thespian had blasted the Government as being an &quot;utter disgrace&quot; just four months after receiving a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe has seen an unprecedented number of migrants dock on its shores by boat and by land since 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated 1.5million migrants have arrived by sea alone in European countries like Italy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the migrants come from Muslim-majority countries - such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and countries on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated 1.5million migrants have arrived by sea alone in European countries like Italy, over the past three years.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef estimates that 50,000 of the new arrivals to Bangladesh are pregnant women and an &quot;unprecedented&quot; 60 per cent of new refugees in Bangladesh are children.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 1,267 children have been separated from their families and are at particular risk of human trafficking, sexual abuse, child labour and child marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've just returned from Bangladesh where I joined a team to assess the need on the ground and see how Islamic Relief can help these displaced people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I met some of them when I joined my colleagues in the southern fishing port of Cox's Bazar, before heading further south on the Naf River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, thousands of refugees are fleeing Burma by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Bangladesh, if you look east to a ridge of tree-covered mountains, Burma is close enough to make out buildings and lights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">InTeknaf, the southernmost city on mainland Bangladesh, we walked to a crossing point used by the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There we found a dozen narrow wooden boats, which were collecting and dropping off groups of people carrying their few hastily-gathered possessions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslims flee violence in Burma</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family fled their home as the conflict erupted and the river crossing was the second step on their journey through the border area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad was accompanied by several members of his village and they all provided mutual support to each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holding his two-year-old son, Noyum, in his arms, Muhammad told me:&quot;We left in the middle of the night. We had time only to grab our children. We left everything behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Tayum Kali refugee camp, roughly 4km from the Burmese border, I met Soydul Amin, who arrived in Bangladesh on 12 September with five family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had to flee overnight and, like the others I met, also left his life possessions behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soydul has shown incredible resolve by clearing part of a hillside then levelling it out using hand tools - aiming to, quite literally, build a new home for his uprooted family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has built a shelter frame out of bamboo, covering it with plastic sheeting purchased from the local market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resolute Soydul told me: &quot;My family and I will clear this land and make a shelter. We will support each other and others around us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these refugees are self-sufficient and stoic individuals, determined to make the best of a bad situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this independent spirit is essential to get refugees through the chaos and confusion of their arrival in Bangladesh, it will be down to NGOs, such as Islamic Relief, for the most part to provide them with improved shelter units, water, sanitation and food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these refugee settlements are on hilltops. In early December - just over two months away - the temperature will drop dramatically and these makeshift shelters will prove inadequate for the coming winter months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is vital that the international community comprehends their plight and responds in their hour of need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now back home in England, I cannot help but wonder whether Noyum received the medical treatment he so urgently needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the point where so many are seeking a new life away from sectarian violence, for too many it has marked the end of theirs. Surely their life is too high a price for anyone to pay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As winter approaches, the Greek government is being urged to act to prevent the possible deaths of refugees trapped in squalid camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dozen human rights organisations, including Oxfam and Human Rights Watch (HRW), have united to highlight the issue, stressing Greece needs the support of EU leaders to end the policy of &quot;containment&quot;, which restricts asylum-seekers to the islands while their claims are processed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has been urged to transfer the refugees to better living conditions on the mainland by the time winter officially starts on 21 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This remains a matter of life and death,&quot; Jana Frey, Greece's director for the International Rescue Committee, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is absolutely no excuse for the conditions on the islands right now - thousands of people crammed into overcrowded and desperately under-resourced facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrant &quot;hotspots&quot; at Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros, and Kos are almost 7,200 over capacity, with close to 13,000 people, including many women and children, in facilities with a capacity of just 5,576, according to the groups. The majority of refugees are believed to be Syrians and Iraqis fleeing their war-torn countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those stuck in the camps live in harsh and often unsanitary conditions, often sleeping on the ground, exposed to the cold and rain, with limited access to proper toilets and showers, while women are forced to share tents and containers with unrelated men, risking their safety, the groupssaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last winter, at least three men are known to have died on Lesbos, with their deaths attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning from makeshift heating devices used to warm the freezing tents, the umbrella group said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy of containment was put in place as part of the EU-Turkey deal in March 2016, forcing asylum seekers arriving on the Greek islands to remain there until their claims are decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups claim forcing asylum-seekers to remain in such poor conditions cannot be justified, with some who arrived in Greece during the early days of the deal having remained there for 20 months. The deal was intended to send back failed asylum seekers to Turkey, but deportations have been far outstripped by the numbers who continue to arrive, they said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicola Bay, head of Oxfam in Greece, said that by trying to preserve the EU-Turkey deal, the Greek islands &quot;have been transformed into places of indefinite confinement for asylum seekers who have risked their lives in search of safety and a better life in Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responsibility for running the camps now lies with the Greek Government, who took over from the various NGOs in August this year, redirecting EU funding of the refugee crisis from charities to the Greek authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU announced earlier this year it was cutting emergency funding to Greece in a move that was roundly condemned by groups working to help refugees, who have pointed to surging levels of self-harm among asylum-seekers stuck in the camps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A draft of the code leaked to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) would force them to allow police officers on board and return immediately to port, rather than transferring migrants to other ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would also ban rescuers from entering Libyan territorial waters, using lights to signal their location to boats at imminent risk of sinking or communicating with smugglers by phone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-smuggling efforts in Mediterranean 'fail to tackle problem'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, which has not been finalised, threatened to bar any NGOs who do not sign the code from Italian ports, forcing them to journey further carrying passengers frequently including pregnant women, torture victims and infants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as Italy's pleas for support from fellow EU nations in redistributing around 200,000 migrants in overflowing government reception centres fall on deaf ears, amid waning political will to support refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2,300 migrants have lost their lives attempting to reach Europe so far this year, mainly on the treacherous route between Libya and Italy, while 105,200 asylum seekers mainly from Sub-Saharan Africa, Bangladesh and Syria have made it to shore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian ships have become increasingly instrumental in rescue operations, picking up more than a third of all migrants rescued in 2017 compared to 1 per cent in 2014, and are struggling to cope with the summer peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jugend Rettet, which is among the groups operating rescue ships off the coast of Libya, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thatforcing vessels to return to land to disembark migrants would take them out of the search and rescue zone &quot;where they are urgently needed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs are deployed to boats in distress by commanders in Rome, with smaller ships frequently transferring rescued refugees to larger vessels so they cancontinue rescues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This draft for a code of conduct is a real threat for thousands of people,&quot; said Jugent Rettet's Isa Grahn, adding that it was &quot;not an option&quot; for the group to have a police officer on board its ship. &quot;Humanitarian work has to be separated from political aims and be protected from political or military intervention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 11-point plan was drafted by the Italian government and first proposed at an informal meeting of the European Justice and Home Affairs Council on 6 July. It has not yet been officially presented to aid agencies, with the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas) saying it had not yet been approached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrants on a dinghy are rescued by Save the Children NGO crew from the ship 'Vos Hestia' off the coast of Libya, 17 June 2017 (Reuters)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save the Children, which also operates a rescue mission, said it had not been shown the proposals by officials.&quot;We will engage constructively with Italian authorities on any code of conduct that is fully aligned with our mandate to save lives and with International Maritime law,&quot; a spokesperson told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;Save the Children operates in line with its humanitarian imperative to save lives, in compliance with international maritime law and in full transparency and cooperation with relevant authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vincent Cochetel, the UN Refugee Agency's special envoy for the Central Mediterranean route, said that any code of conduct must be imposed for all actors - not just NGOs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU's 'reckless operations causing refugees to die in Mediterranean'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a report launch in Brussels earlier this month, he said that Rome's maritime rescue coordination centre (MRCC) reviews all ships availableto respond to distress calls but &quot;often we see shipping companies switching off their GPS systems in order not to rescue people. Can we have a code of conduct also for these shipping companies?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NGOs are out there in the Mediterranean rescuing people because the EU is not,&quot; said Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at HRW. &quot;Given the scale of tragedies at sea and the horrific abuses migrants and asylum seekers face in Libya, the EU should work with Italy to enhance robust search and rescue in the waters off Libya, not limit it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iverna McGowan, director of Amnesty International's European institutions office, said the draft code of conduct would &quot;risk endangering thousands of lives by impeding rescue boats from accessing the perilous waters near Libya&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libyan Coast Guard puts refugees and rescuers in danger during rescue operation at sea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She characterised the proposals as part of a &quot;concerted smear campaign&quot; against NGO rescue ships, which has culminated in a far-right group calling itself Defend Europe sending its own vessel to disrupt operations in the Mediterranean Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right-wing politicians have made persistent claims that aid agencies are aiding or even directly colluding with Libyan smugglers without citing evidence, despite two parliamentary committee inquiries in Italy finding no evidence of misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Academic studies have found no link between rescues and rising Mediterranean crossings and deaths, while a parliamentary report in the UK branded the EU's anti-smuggling mission a &quot;failure&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Lords EU External Affairs Sub-Committee found that Operation Sophia, launched to replace the Italian government's rescue efforts in 2015, &quot;has not in any meaningful way deterred the flow of migrants, disrupted the smugglers' networks, or impeded the business of people smuggling&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As reported by </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the committee also concluded that the mission was driving refugee deaths by destroying smugglers' boats and forcing them to switch to unseaworthy dinghies that are launched en masse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lords report said a naval mission was the &quot;wrong tool&quot; to gather intelligence on land-based smuggling networks leading to the Libyan coast, which is now the main departure point for boats heading towards Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also raised concern over reports of &quot;serious abuses of the human rights of migrants by the Libyan coastguard&quot;, which is being trained by the UK and equipped by the EU as it seeks to gradually unburden itself of responsibility for rescues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent incidents include a near miss between a Libyan coastguard patrol ship and vessel operated by German charity Sea-Watch, gunfire during a rescue and widespread allegations of the beating, torture and robbery of refugees forced back to shore in violation of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has warned of widespread torture, arbitrary detention, rape, forced labour and &quot;slave auctions&quot; in Libya, where people smugglers have set up a lucrative business in the chaos of its continuing civil war.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's Rohingya community has rallied in Sydney and Melbourne, urging greater international intervention against military attacks on the ethnic minority in Myanmar, which the head of the United Nations has described as at risk of becoming ethnic cleansing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Refugee Council of Australia has called on the federal government to consider a special resettlement program - similar to the successful one it ran for Syrian and Iraqi refugees - for Rohingya forcibly displaced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rakhine state, home to the majority of Myanmar's one million Rohingya, the government's military forces have been accused of a scorched earth policy - razing villages and killing civilians - under the cover of a clearance operation seeking out militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Who are the Rohingya and what is happening in Myanmar?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from inside the state - from which independent observers, media and aid groups have been banned - say homes are being burned, fleeing civilians shot or hacked to death with knives, women are being raped and children murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 400 people have been killed, while some reports, as yet unconfirmed, say the death toll could be in the thousands. More than 100,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh. There are also reports the military has laid landmines behind fleeing refugees to stop them returning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the violence reached the level of ethnic cleansing, the United Nations secretary general, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, said &quot;we are facing a risk, I hope we don't get there&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I appeal to all, all authorities in Myanmar, civilian authorities and military authorities, to indeed put an end to this violence that, in my opinion, is creating a situation that can destabilise the region,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslim Rohingya are an ethnic and religious minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. For decades they have faced systemic and extreme persecution at the hands of the military government, which refuses to recognise them as citizens or allow them to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya are not allowed to travel outside their villages without permission, are denied access to higher education and to healthcare, and are regularly subjected to communal violence by the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya, Myanmar's government maintains, are Muslim Bangladeshi interlopers and have no place in the Buddhist-majority country - despite the fact many Rohingyan families have lived in Myanmar since before its independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Sydney on Thursday, Rohingya living in Australia pleaded with the federal government to do more to end the current violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please help us, our Rohingyan people are dying, please help us, they are being killed,&quot; Mohammad Sidek said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sidek, a construction worker who has lived in Sydney for five years, said three members of his family were killed on Monday by Myanmar's military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their deaths had caused his remaining family to flee 50km on foot to the Bangladesh border where fishermen had ferried them to safety across the Naf River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahsan Haque from the Burmese Rohingya Community in Australia organisation said his grandparents' house had been burned to the ground earlier this week and his family members forced to flee into Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there are so many people we don't know about, we don't know what has happened to them. It is just horrific, what our people are going through is just unimaginable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haque told the Guardian the numbers of people killed in the violence was far higher than what was being reported by the Myanmar military. He said he had received reports from inside the country that there had been several thousands deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Myanmar government is not even listening to anybody about this. They are acting like a bully. The whole world is disappointed by Aung San Suu Kyi's inaction. She's suffered for the cause of freedom, but now, her silence is an agreement with what the government is doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haque said the international community should place sanctions on the Myanmar government, and Australia should consider withholding its significant aid program in the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Take away Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel peace prize. She no longer deserves it | George Monbiot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Power, chief executive of the Refugee Council of Australia, said the Australian government should directly pressure the Myanmar government to end the military crackdown, provide emergency assistance to those displaced, and offer resettlement places to Rohingya refugees who cannot return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia has resettled just a handful of Rohingya refugees in recent years despite hundreds being either held in immigration detention on Manus, Nauru or in Australia and others enduring prolonged delays to their refugee applications. Australia's provision of an additional humanitarian intake for Rohingya would illustrate the nation's commitment to the Asia Pacific region and its intention to provide humanitarian leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amnesty International Australia president, Gabe Kavanagh, said the international community needed to protect the Rohingya minority from the Myanmarese military. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are burning homes and communities, they are shooting at civilians and they are restricting aid to communities in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to put an end to this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the criticism has centred on Myanmar's de facto leader, first state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, once lauded globally as an icon of peaceful democratic resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of nationalist hero General Aung San and a Nobel peace laureate for her defiance to the military junta which controlled Myanmar for half a century, has said &quot;fake news photographs&quot; have distorted understanding of the situation in Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That kind of fake information ... was simply the tip of a huge iceberg of misinformation calculated to create a lot of problems between different communities and with the aim of promoting the interest of the terrorists,&quot; she said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Suu Kyi does not directly control the army, she has enormous moral authority in Myanmar, and has been criticised for failing to condemn the atrocities. Protests in Australia have followed similar rallies across the region and the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Jakarta, demonstrators have gathered outside the Myanmarese embassy for three consecutive days demanding an end to the military operation. Pakistan's government has urged Myanmar to &quot;take necessary measures to protect the rights of Rohingya Muslims&quot; while 20-year-old Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai said the &quot;shameful treatment&quot; of the minority must be condemned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Myanmar's actions amounted to &quot;genocide&quot; against the Rohingya and pledged to raise the issue before the United Nations general assembly this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a strictly enforced secrecy shrouding Rakhine state, the list of atrocities committed against the minority has been comprehensively documented, by the United Nations, human rightsgroups and national governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Aung San Suu Kyi says 'terrorists' are misinforming world about Myanmar violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya have been subject to &quot; decades of systematic and institutionalised discrimination &quot;, the UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, said in February this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya have been forbidden from having more than two children, they are banned from moving from their villages, and they are outlawed from accessing schooling and healthcare or from working in certain professions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regularly their villages are raided by security forces in &quot;clearance operations&quot;, in which soldiers loot and raze homes - often with people inside - and destroy entire settlements. Men, women and children have been summarily executed, and the rape of women and girls is used as a weapon. Testimony from survivors compiled by the UN this year  detailed the stabbing of babies and burning of elderly people who couldn't flee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NO-ONE can be prepared for the sight that greets them as they arrive at the Mahama refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning the corner to the United Nations' compound that sits above the sprawling site on Rwanda's border with Tanzania, it is the size of the settlement that takes your breath away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is vast, a network of rudimentary red-brick dwellings nestling together that stretches away as far as the eye can see. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The physical scale of the refugee camp is an indication of the challenges which are faced by Rwanda to accommodate the tens of thousands who have fled from the political turmoil in neighbouring Burundi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was less than a quarter of a century ago that Rwandans would have faced the same plight as their own nation was in the grip of a genocide which saw as many as a million lives lost in just 100 days in 1994. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, it is Rwanda which is offering a sanctuary not only to those fleeing from Burundi, but to refugees escaping the long-running violence in another troubled neighbour, the Democratic Republic of Congo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here in the Mahama refugee camp, a glimmer of hope is being offered through cricket with a sport that is increasingly being used to define reconciliation in Rwanda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new charity, Cricket Builds Hope, has been launched to spread the sport across the country and bring about social change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sceptics may have reservations over such an apparently idealised approach, and claim that what Rwanda needs is investment in infrastructure and industry rather than sport. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to witness one of the first cricket demonstrations to be played at Mahama would help convince even the most stone-hearted of cynics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In front of 200 children who have never seen the game before, the captain of the Rwanda women's international team, Mary Maina, is introducing cricket to the masses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be about as far removed as anyone could imagine from the version that is about to be played this month as the Ashes gets under way at the Gabba in Brisbane, but the enthusiasm of the new recruits is infectious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four cones are set out with a plastic ball on top of each of them, and the batting team lines up to take turns in whacking them as far as they can. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100ft away, the fielding team congregates waiting for each ball to land while the batter sprints around a pair of wickets to score runs in a fusion of cricket and baseball. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scenes are endearingly chaotic, and the fun that the game is bringing to communities that have so little in the way of recreation is plain to see. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is step by step,&quot; says Mary, 24, who was herself introduced to cricket after watching a demonstration six years ago. &quot;There's the fun bit first - it helps you mobilise the kids so they want to come next time. Then you add skills one by one, and then hopefully a cricketer is born.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children who took part in the hour-long session give a refreshingly simple verdict on the game that many a professional cricketer could learn from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles, 13, who has lived at Mahama for two years had never seen cricket before, but said: &quot;It is easy, you just hit the ball.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tour of the camp shows the efforts that are under way to improve life for the 55,500 refugees who live there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education and recreational facilities have been introduced to provide the chance not only to learn, but also to help as a distraction from the harrowing psychological effects of having to flee your homeland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cricket is key to this, according to Joseph Kamuzinzi, the camp's protection assistant in charge of youth and sports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sport is about security, it gives them the chance to focus on something to help forget about the trauma and all the problems that refugees have. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It brings communities together, allowing them to make new friends and build relationships that help them cope,&quot; he adds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The session at the refugee camp offers a brief glimpse into how Cricket Builds Hope is aiming to introduce the sport to as wide an audience as possible and bring about social change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahama is remote and a four-hour journey from the capital, Kigali, the final hour of which is down a rutted dirt road. Its population has risen from 8,000 to 55,500 in the space of just two years as families flee the political instability of Burundi. Of its current population, 51 per cent are children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is exactly these communities that Cricket Builds Hope is looking to target, building on the work of its previous incarnation, the Rwanda Cricket Stadium Foundation, which has introduced the country's first international ground in the capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cricket, for instance, is being used to promote sexual health education and prevent the spread of HIV. Training sessions include the message that the stumps are the batter's life, and the bat is a condom to protect against the advancing ball, which is the disease. A simple metaphor, but one that is being used repeatedly across Rwanda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cricket Builds Hope project has international backing, including the UK-based Cricket Without Boundaries that has undertaken similar work elsewhere in Africa, and The Lord's Taverners, which has donated 1,000 items of kit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Taylors of Harrogate, the company behind Yorkshire Tea, is also playing its part in supporting a country that it has had close ties with for 50 years while purchasing some of the finest tea in the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yorkshire-based company has pledged &pound;90,000 over the next three years to promote cricket, building on the &pound;1m it has already invested in Rwanda since 2010 on social and environmental projects, such as introducing wells on tea estates to improve water supplies and encouraging farm diversification. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dom Dwight, the marketing manager at Yorkshire Tea, was among those who visited the Mahama refugee camp to witness firsthand the effects that cricket is having. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed money will continue to be made available for other schemes in Rwanda, but cricket is now a major focus for the firm, with plans to create a tournament, The Yorkshire Tea Tea Cup, within the next two to three years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to admit, I asked questions myself as to whether introducing a sport like cricket was the best way forward. But seeing the passion that it is bringing, it is obvious how important the sport can become,&quot; he says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The visit to the refugee camp has reinforced to me the benefits of the work that Cricket Builds Hope and organisations like the United Nations are doing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taylors can't take credit for what is happening in places like Mahama, but hopefully our support in other parts of Rwanda will help drive the whole initiative forward.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In The Yorkshire Post tomorrow, how Rwanda is looking to the future through cricket. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TOP eurocrat today said he expects Britain to take part in a proposed EU scheme to relocate genuine refugees from Africa to Europe, which is primarily designed to bring an end to the continent's growing migration crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EbS</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frans Timmermans says he expects Britain to take part in a new refugee scheme</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU Commission deputy head Frans Timmermans said he anticipated Westminster green-lighting the voluntary programme because previous UK Governments had championed taking in people in need of international protection straight from refugee camps overseas.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron pledged to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees directly from UN-run camps in the Middle East rather than participating in Brussels' migrant quota system, saying it was a better way of guaranteeing those in genuine peril were helped.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Italian MP warns Macron migrant crisis threatens whole bloc  Macron bashed over migration stance as shine wears off in Brussels </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eurocrats are drawing up plans for their own relocation scheme from countries such as Libya, Ethiopia and Sudan in an attempt to smash the business model of people smugglers ferrying hundreds of thousands of people to Italy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme would be twinned with a Turkey-style migration deal with Libya under which all people crossing the Mediterranean would automatically be sent back, disincentivising them from making the perilous trip.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10,000 people, predominantly economic migrants, are arriving in Italy every day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Timmermans was asked during a press conference in Strasbourg this evening what the scope of the proposal would be in terms of numbers and whether or not he would expect the UK to take part even though it is leaving the EU.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response the eurocrat declined to go into numbers, saying that was a matter for ministers to discuss, but did stress that any scheme would be carried out in conjunction with the UN to make sure only eligible people were provided with sanctuary.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I would imagine that the UK would be part of this discussion, especially because resettlement from the very start has been a pivotal element in the British approach to this problem.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if we talk about a new resettlement pledging exercise notably from Libya, Egypt, Niger, Ethiopia and Sudan which we can do in conjunction with the UNHCR, this would all meet the requirements the British governments in the past have always set for doing resettlement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That you work closely with the UNHCR, you identify the people who would be eligible et cetera, et cetera, and I think this is an exercise we need to do at the European level and I count on solidarity from all member states including the UK.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the press conference Mr Timmermans expressed extreme sympathy for Italy, which is currently struggling to cope with 10,000 new arrivals every day, and berated other member states for not coming good on their commitments to relocate migrants.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also admitted that the majority of those being rescued at sea are not refugees but economic migrants, and said the only way to regain the trust of European populations and restore their faith in the system for those genuinely needing asylum was to start deporting more people.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Many of the people arriving in Italy today, when scrutinised, do not have the right to international protection because they don't flee from war or persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They seek a better life which is a noble exercise in itself but does not grant them the right to stay in the European Union.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about whether there needs to be a tightening up the Geneva Convention he insisted working more closely with countries of origin and those the migrants travel through on their way to Europe would be a better solution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the top eurocrat did also appear to express frustration with human rights law slowing down the deportation process, lamenting that it &quot;becomes excruciatingly difficult to get them back to their place of origin&quot; once people have arrived on European soil.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned: &quot;There is the concern that a lot of people who aren't refugees are using it as an opportunity to come here for economic reasons and that's not what the refugee status is all about. We need to make sure that people who do not have the right to asylum return to their places of origin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is the only way we can retain enough solidarity in European societies to offer a safe haven to people who do flee persecution and war, and if we give up on that we give up on our fundamental values.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on a gloomy note, he concluded: &quot;This migration issue will not go away - not today, not tomorrow, not next year, not for a decade, not for two decades. This is a global phenomenon that will be with us for generations, we'd better find sustainable solutions.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHUNNED, shamed, threatened with death - research commissioned by a United Nations agency reveals the widespread sexual violence against men and boys affected by the Syria crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers for the UNHCR refugee agency heard accounts of violence against boys as young as ten and men in their 80s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All parties to the conflict were implicated, with abuses said to have occurred in detention in Syria and in both official and makeshift camps for displaced people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gay and bisexual people were found to be particularly vulnerable, along with transgender and intersex individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviews revealed how survivors were blackmailed and shamed. Refugee men and boys working informally outside of Syria told how some employers refused to give them their wages unless they performed sex acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings are based on evidence gathered from Syrians living in Jordan, Lebanon, and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, all of which are home to large populations of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR says the report reveals sexual violence against refugee men and boys &quot;may be far more widespread than previously understood&quot;, despite the documentation of the extent of similar abuses against women and girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One focus group of refugee women in Jordan estimated that 30 to 40 per cent of all adult men in their community had experienced sexual violence during detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the agency says little specialise help is available and few victims know it exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volker Turk, assistant high commissioner for protection, said: &quot;These are most disturbing accounts revealing just how grave the risk of sexual violence has become both for women and girls and, as shown by this recent report, also men and boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's clear too that we are faced with a vicious cycle here of little help being available, limited outreach to male survivors, inaccessible services, and a culture of silence - all of which reinforce a myth that this problem is rare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One gay man, identified as Tarek, told how he was held in darkness with 80 people for one month, suffering torture and sexual violence. He told researchers: &quot;I thought we would die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another revealed an uncle's experience, saying that he died from kidney failure after developing eating problems and alcoholism as a result of his time in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informants, parents and adolescents highlighted harassment and violence in schools, including sexual violence. A legal aid officer in Jordan said: &quot;The mother will come to us and at first she will describe it as 'bullying', but later we find out it was a sexual act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the social impact, one official in Iraqi Kurdistan said: &quot;Community stigma is the biggest issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man must be strong enough not just to defend his family but also himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He will be known as weak, incompetent and inappropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says refugee agencies must create stronger prevention strategies, better confidentiality arrangements, protection against reprisals and improved care for survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also also calls for further research into the prevention and response to sexual violence against males in conflict and displacement.</SPAN></P>

Whilst the focus should remain on creating an enabling environment for safe and dignified voluntary returns of Rohingya to Myanmar, we need to also ensure that local communities, who are already facing enormous challenges, are not left behind and that we provide them medium and long-term development assistance. Any solution has to inevitably include political dialogue with all parties involved.'<BR><BR>Commissioner Stylianides will travel to Bangladesh next week to meet with Rohingya refugees and visit EU aid projects in the affected areas.<BR><BR>Background<BR><BR>The European Union is co-hosting the Pledging Conference on the Rohingya Refugee Crisis, with Kuwait, in Geneva on 23 October, in partnership with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).<BR><BR>Of the EUR30 million announced at the pledging conference EUR5 million are allocated for emergency humanitarian aid to meet the most urgent needs of the Rohingya population and host communities in Bangladesh; another EUR5 million to support the registration of arriving Rohingya and a total of EUR20 million to support early recovery and development actions in the country.<BR><BR>Registration of the Rohingya in line with international standards will enable to better target support, help ensure protection rights and facilitate return when conditions allow.<BR><BR>According to latest estimates, around 600,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh during the past two months, since the exodus began on 25 August following the latest spate of violence. This brings the total number of Rohingya in the Cox's Bazar area in Bangladesh to about 900,000.<BR><BR>Humanitarian aid projects, including EU-funded, are severely limited during the last weeks due to restricted humanitarian access in Myanmar's Rakhine State.<BR><BR>The European Union has been funding humanitarian programmes in Cox's Bazar since 1994 through international NGOs and the UN. Since 2007, the EU has allocated about EUR 157 million to Bangladesh; of which close to EUR38 million has been allocated for basic health care, water, sanitation, shelter, nutrition, protection and psychological support to the Rohingya.<BR><BR>In Myanmar the EU has provided since 2010 more than EUR76.5 million in humanitarian aid to vulnerable people in Rakhine state, including in the more isolated northern areas which Christos Stylianides became the first European Commissioner to ever visit, earlier this May. In 2017, the EU is funding projects throughout Myanmar's Rakhine State to address some of the most urgent needs, including food and nutrition, basic health services, water, sanitation, protection and shelter for affected communities displaced by outbreaks of violence in 2012 and 2016.<BR><BR>For More Information<BR><BR>Factsheet on Bangladesh<BR><BR>Factsheet on the Rohingya crisis<BR><BR>IP/17/4086<BR><BR>Press contacts:<BR><BR>Carlos MARTIN RUIZ DE GORDEJUELA (+32 2 296 53 22)<BR><BR>Daniel PUGLISI (+32 2 296 91 40)<BR><BR>Christina WUNDER (+32 2 299 22 56)<BR><BR>General public inquiries: Europe Direct by phone 00 800 67 89 10 11 or by email<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis has demanded that the international community take &quot;decisive measures&quot; to resolve the causes of the mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Burma, breaking his recent silence over what the United Nations has declared to be a textbook case of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving in Bangladesh from Burma, he said it also was &quot;imperative&quot; for world governments to immediately provide assistance to help the Bangladeshi government cope with Asia's worst refugee crisis in decades.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech in front of Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid, government officials and ambassadors from around the world, Francis praised Bangladesh's sacrifice and generosity in welcoming in so many refugees &quot;before the eyes of the whole world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not identify the Rohingya by name, ethnicity or faith, referring only to &quot;refugees from Rakhine state&quot; b ut his words were sharp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of us can fail to be aware of the gravity of the situation, the immense toll of human suffering involved, and the precarious living conditions of so many of our brothers and sisters, a majority of whom are women and children, crowded in the refugee camps,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is imperative that the international community take decisive measures to address this grave crisis, not only by working to resolve the political issues that have led to the mass displacement of people, but also by offering immediate material assistance to Bangladesh in its effort to respond effectively to urgent human needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis, a tireless and fearless advocate for refugees, outcasts and society's most marginal, had drawn criticism from human rights organisations and Rohingya themselves for having failed to speak out publicly about their plight while he was in Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had remained silent out of diplomatic deference to his hosts, who consider the Rohingya as having illegally migrated from Bangladesh and do not recognise them as one of Burma's ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 620,000 Rohingya have fled Burma and poured into Bangladesh refugee camps over the last few months amid a scorched earth campaign by the Burmese military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vatican defended the Pope's silence, saying he wanted to &quot;build bridges&quot; with the predominantly Buddhist nation, which only recently established diplomatic relations with the Holy See.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesman Greg Burke said Francis took seriously the advice given to him by the local Catholic Church, which urged him to toe a cautious line and not refer to the Rohingya by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya have faced persecution and discrimination in Burma for decades and are denied citizenship, even though many families have lived there for generations. The situation grew worse in August when the army began what it called clearance operations in Rakhine state following attacks on security positions by a group of Rohingya militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya living in camps in Bangladesh have described indiscriminate attacks by Burmese security forces and Buddhist mobs, including killings, rapes and the torching of entire villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh President Hamid accused Burma's military of having committed &quot;ruthless atrocities&quot; against the Muslims and, in his speech to Pope Francis, demanded international help to return them safely to Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our people welcomed them with open arms, sharing food, shelter and other basic needs,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, it is our shared responsibility to ensure for them a safe, sustainable and dignified return to their own home and integration with the social, economic and political life of Myanmar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya crisis loomed large over Francis's arrival in Dhaka, where huge banners with pictures of the Pope and Mr Hamid dotted billboards around town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security was tight and was of particular concern after a Christian priest went missing in northern Bangladesh on Tuesday, and his family reported they received calls demanding money. Police said they were looking for the man but would not confirm if it was a kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's leading English-language newspaper, The Daily Star, said in an editorial it felt &quot;slightly let down&quot; that the Pope did not mention the Rohingya crisis specifically while in Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We remain hopeful that given Pope Francis' legacy of standing up for the oppressed, he will speak out against the ongoing persecution of the Rohingya during this very important visit,&quot; the paper added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis will not visit the refugee camps while in Bangladesh but will host an interfaith peace meeting on Friday in the garden of the Dhaka archbishops' residence at which a small group of Rohingya are expected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">David&nbsp;Charter, Apolda</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">992 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whistling and shouting reached its climax when Angela Merkel insisted that Germany's strength lay in its diversity and thanked her audience for helping to cope with the influx of migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some politicians might shy away from mentioning the issue that has damaged them the most and has stirred up the greatest anger - especially when visiting the heartland of her most vociferous opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not Angela Merkel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-serving chancellor came to the former East Germany on the election trail this week and defended her refugee policy, despite the noise made by a small number of nationalists. From the summer of 2015 when she allowed in tens of thousands of asylum seekers stranded in Hungary, about a million more have come to Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know the past years were not easy,&quot; she began, as hecklers in the open-air venue in the town of Apolda chanted &quot;liar, liar&quot; and &quot;Merkel must go&quot;. From vantage points around the edge of the 2,000-strong crowd police kept watch through binoculars while other officers mingled with the two dozen people doing the heckling. Mrs Merkel likes to address rallies without protective screening and it makes the security services palpably nervous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2015, when so many refugees arrived, I often talked to district administrators about how we could manage all this,&quot; she said. &quot;I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many helpers and officials who worked so hard in a humanitarian emergency so that we managed this big challenge and provided protection for people who needed it. Thank you for your commitment. That showed the good side of Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even among her core supporters some doubt the wisdom of her refugee policy - but they still believe she is the best choice for chancellor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was perhaps her one mistake,&quot; said Ramona, a nurse, who travelled from the nearby city of Erfurt to hear Mrs Merkel speak. &quot;It is going to be tough in the next few years - it was just young men who came, and they have to find work. But we are standing by Merkel. It was the ethical thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winfried Moeller, 66, a car dealer, was angry with European countries for leaving the problem to Germany. &quot;We are a people of 80 million, we can take in a few refugees. No one has ever starved to death in Germany or was in misery because of these few refugees,&quot; he said. &quot;This is important. Merkel is a Christian, her father was a pastor. Naturally, she thinks like a Christian and acted accordingly. She could not have done otherwise. What she did was right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel is comfortably ahead in opinion polls for the election on September 24 and heading for a fourth four-year term. Most analysts believe the real question is her margin of victory, and which party will join her in a coalition. Her Christian Democratic Union (CDU/CSU) is fed up with the &quot;grand coalition&quot; with the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) led by Martin Schulz. The feeling is mutual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A combination of factors explain Mrs Merkel's enduring appeal, including luck. She reaped the benefit of difficult labour market reforms by Gerhard Schr&ouml;der, her SPD predecessor, which partly explain Germany's 3.8 per cent unemployment rate, the second-lowest in the EU. This masks a large class of working poor, with the bottom 40 per cent of Germans having almost no assets or bank savings. But since she saw off Mr Schr&ouml;der in 2005 she has not faced a popular rival, either within her own party or from the SPD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In eastern Germany the nationalist AfD has the highest support but nationally it is polling at barely 8 per cent. One of Mrs Merkel's hecklers, Erwin Schmidt, 70, said: &quot;She has divided the German people with her asylum policy. She let in illegal immigrants without passport or papers, she opened the doors for terrorism, for Islam, and we do not want her any longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born Angela Kasner, she excelled as a student in Russian and physics and spent her first 35 years behind the Iron Curtain. She married Ulrich Merkel at 23 and although the union lasted only five years she kept the name, even after remarrying in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her biographers draw parallels between her father's parsonage, a close-knit sanctuary from intrusive communist rule where one word out of place was sufficient to end careers, and her fiercely loyal chancellery &quot;family&quot; in Berlin. It also helps to explain the pathological care she takes to weigh her words and mull decisions, and the value she places on the discretion of her closest advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another lucky asset has been the political turmoil beyond Germany's borders. Poland is in the grip of a constitutional crisis after choosing the right-wing Law and Justice party, while to the east Turkey and Russia provide further warnings of the dangers of nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her election speech referred to &quot;shock&quot; at Brexit and &quot;worries&quot; that the far right could have won elections in France and the Netherlands. Amid the chaos, Germans feel they should stick with &quot;Mutti&quot; (mummy), as she is known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She stands for constancy, for security,&quot; said Gerret, 53, who works for a tiling company in Apolda. &quot;We are doing well in Germany. We don't like experiments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot;President Erdogan has told ethnic Turks in Germany not to vote for the two parties in Angela Merkel's ruling coalition in next month's elections. Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) were hostile to Turkey, he said. So were the opposition Greens. &quot;I tell all my kinsmen in Germany . . . not to vote for them. Neither the Christian Democrats nor the SPD nor the Greens. They are all enemies of Turkey,&quot; Mr Erdogan said in Istanbul. &quot;It is necessary to teach a lesson at the ballot box to these political parties, who have disrespected Turkey.&quot; He accused the SPD and CDU of abusing Turkey to gain greater popular support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany has criticised Turkey over the crackdown that followed last year's failed coup. Sigmar Gabriel, the foreign minster, called Mr Erdogan's comments an &quot;unprecedented act of interference&quot; in German sovereignty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty refugees and asylum seekers have graduated from in an innovative new programme, helping them to access higher education in the UK.<BR><BR>Organised by Cardiff University and the Welsh Refugee Council, the six week ASPIRE summer school has been designed to address some of the challenges that refugees, asylum seekers and forced migrants face when seeking to return to study.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many migrants arriving in the UK have left behind established careers. All too often, careers, education and aspirations for the future have been disrupted by the difficult and distressing circumstances - including war, persecution, and conflict - which force people to flee their home countries.<BR><BR>A plan for the future<BR><BR>Common barriers to study include a lack of guidance on how to access education and training, non-recognition of international qualifications, financial constraints, and a lack of access to English classes needed to gain the level of English language skills necessary for study at university level. The trauma of past experiences, coupled with insecurity about the right to remain in the UK, can also make it extremely difficult to have the confidence to plan for the future.<BR><BR>The ASPIRE school has helped the students to overcome some of these obstacles through providing intensive English classes and academic taster courses, inspirational trips and tours to help boost the confidence of those taking part, and expert advice on how to apply to university. Taster courses included Business Management, Peer Mentoring and Coaching, and Public Service Interpreting for Health.<BR><BR>Supported by their participation in the programme, a number of participants have secured opportunities to study at universities within the UK, including unconditional offers to study courses at postgraduate level.<BR><BR>Khalid, a 23 year old civil engineer from Khartoum, Sudan previously worked as a teaching assistant and site engineer before coming to the UK nine months ago. With aspirations to become a professional designer, he enrolled in the summer school in an effort to improve his academic English, and has several offers to study for an MSc in Structural Engineering.<BR><BR>An enormous help<BR><BR>Speaking ahead of the graduation ceremony, Khalid said: 'The Summer School has been an enormous help in allowing me to improve my English, and a huge boost to my confidence. Thanks to the friendly and accommodating tutors, I now feel comfortable working with academic material through the English language. I'm now looking forward to taking the next steps in my career as a designer, and building a new future for myself.'<BR><BR>Cardiff University's Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Karen Holford, said: 'The ASPIRE Summer School is yet another brilliant initiative as part of our commitment to support asylum seekers and refugees, and is an important element of our endeavour to recruit and retain the brightest students from all backgrounds...'<BR><BR>A source of pride<BR><BR>Salah Mohamed, Chief Executive of the Welsh Refugee Council added: 'Congratulations to all the learners graduating. Welsh Refugee Council is very proud of all the graduates and is happy to see the real difference the ASPIRE Summer School has made to sanctuary seekers in Wales. We are hopeful that students will use their new skills to reach their full potential. We are grateful to all funders and partners who worked very hard to achieve this amazing accomplishment.'<BR><BR>Welsh Government Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams said: 'I have been delighted to hear of the success of the ASPIRE summer school programme and offer my congratulations, and appreciation, to all involved...'<BR><BR>The ASPIRE Summer School has been made possible thanks to the support of a number of organisations, including funding generously provided by the Pears Foundation and Waterloo Foundation. Ede and Ravenscroft kindly donated academic ceremonial wear for use during the ceremony.<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first refugees I ever met were my parents. My father came to the UK as a refugee from Belgium in 1940. The day the Germans invaded, he and his father fled their home in Brussels. Walking and hitching rides, they made it to Ostend and got on the last boat out of Belgium. In Britain, my father flourished. He learnt English, went to secondary school in west London, qualified for the London School of Economics, and after a year of university joined the Royal Navy. He worked at sea on the &quot;cans&quot;- headphones used to listen to intercepts of German messaging. As a boy, I would feel great pride when he told me stories of the D-Day landings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My mother has her own refugee story; one that starts in Poland. She survived the war with her mother and sister, hiding first in a convent and then with an incredibly brave Warsaw family. In 1946, her mother sent her to the UK to start a new life. Her father, David, was killed in the www.war.No one really talked about him when I was young. However, recently a German history group wrote to say there was new confirmation that David had been sent from Auschwitz to Hailfingen concentration camp near Stuttgart towards the end of 1944. He died there in 1945.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My parents did what is most important to so many refugees: they gave their children the security they themselves never had. This personal backstory deeply aects how I see the refugee crisis. It makes real the idea that &quot;it could be me&quot;. I know that it was the decisions of individual citizens that saved the lives of my relatives 80 years ago, and that same spirit is what's needed today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1942, when my father's mother and sister were living in Brussels, they received a summons from the occupying German authorities to undergo registration. The venue was to be the main railway station. Immediately, my grandmother thought something was amiss - and of course feared being transported to a concentration camp. While some of her friends and relatives told her it was dangerous to refuse to obey instructions, she felt it was far more dangerous to do as she was told. So she packed her bags and made her way with her daughter (my aunt) to a small village south of Brussels where she had previously spent holidays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she arrived at the house of one of the local Catholic farmers, Mr Maurice, she asked him to take her in. For the rest of the war, at enormous risk to himself and his family, Mr Maurice hid these strangers. He would have been shot on the spot if his secret had been discovered - especially since by the end of the war there were 17 other Jews hiding in this village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a teenager I asked my aunt to take me to visit him. He was by then in his seventies, with white hair carefully parted. He was smartly dressed and spoke in soft, slow French that even with my schoolboy learning I could follow.We talked about family, memories, hopes. But there was something I wanted to know. Why did he take such a risk, for the sake of my family? His answer will always stick with me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On doit,&quot; he said. One must. It was innate in him to help someone in trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People often say charity should begin at home. I understand that feeling. But that doesn't mean charity should end at home. Define someone who you don't know as your brother or sister, and you set out one definition of human responsibility and kinship; define them as &quot;other&quot;, and you set out on a dierent and far less humane course. Show empathy for those we do not know, and turn that empathy into action, and we live out the most basic value of humankind. Fail, and we show we have no moral compass at all.</SPAN></P>

I think when people voted - and it was a slim majority - people weren't aware of the consequences, costs and red tape that wererequired. I can't see a solution to the Irish border, EU nationals in the UK, UK nationals in the EU, single market and payback costs. Please, Philip Hammond and Theresa May, reconsider this faux pas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU Referendum was held in order to resolve squabbling within the Conservative Party, but this backfired and they are still squabbling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a very slender majority voted to leave the EU. There was little information made available prior to the vote, but lies were told - notably on the side of buses - which were denied the day after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the vote, it has become clear that the Government had no plan for post-Brexit Britain and little understanding of how the EU actually works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The referendum was ill thought-through - in fact, not thought-through at all. Given the enormity of the decision being taken, a sizeable majority should have been required and in any case the referendum should have been accepted as 'advisory' to be followed up by debate and a vote in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our European friends were saddened by the result of the referendum, but we are now becoming a laughing stock as the ignorance and lack of preparation of our Government becomes apparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before we sign the 'divorce agreement', the people must be given a final say as to whether leaving the EU is indeed what they want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that point we will have the facts. And not on the side of buses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have just read your letter regarding stopping Brexit and I couldn't agree more. Everywhere I go, everyone I speak to, whether they voted Remain or Leave, they are all saying the same thing - we have to allowa change of mind in the light of what we now know. This is democracy. Blindly pressing on, ignoring the evidence is more like a dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In every step of our own lives we change our minds when faced with new evidence. We pull out of house purchases if the survey shows problems we had been unaware of when viewing; we resign from jobs we thought were perfect at interview if working conditions or the ethos changes; we divorce when relationships change - the list is endless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing our mind is a fundamental right in a democratic society. The will of the people is not set in stone. It is the duty of government to be honest and do the right thing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is right that the drowning of refugees in the Mediterranean should spur greater efficiency and moral acumen in harnessing the political will to deal with the refugee crisis. The refugee crisis has slipped down the agenda of domestic and global politics. The EU needs to stop dithering and assist refugees to resettle in host countries close to their homelands. Libya and Turkey are two sources of refugees sailing to Europe but there are other countries, such asJordan and Lebanon, who have received biblical numbers of global refugees in relation to their size and population ratio and get only scant coverage. Their generosity has caused social and economic problems to skyrocket in an already turbulent region. The UK has prided itself onbeing an oasis of tolerance, openness, compassion, justice, solidarity, fairness and diversity. It can rise to the challenge, embrace burden sharing solutions that respect human rights, life and dignity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But since the drowning of Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi in 2015, at least 8500 more refugees and migrants have died or vanished while trying to cross the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, on the second anniversary of his death, peace in Syria has yet to be achieved and those fleeing conflict and violence in that country, as well as Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq and others, are still living in makeshift camps in nations they are not entitled to call their own, such as Greece.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">READ MORE:&nbsp;Angela Constance: Scotland is ready to provide a safe haven for more refugees - when the UK Government allows us to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And only one third of the promised 20,000 Syrians that David Cameron's government promised to resettle in the UK from shelters in the Middle Easy have arrived so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron said the dedicated vulnerable persons resettlement scheme, which was set up in the wake of Alan's death, would provide a &quot;direct and safe&quot; route to Britain for displaced Syrians as an alternative to unofficial migration channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Home Office data, around 8500 people have been accepted and accommodated throughout more than 200 local authority areas. Commenting on the figures, which include more than 1200 arrivals between April and March, Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis said he was &quot;delighted with the significant progress&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, marking the second anniversary of three-year-old Alan's death, the UNHCR refugee agency urged the international community to take &quot;robust action&quot; to prevent more tragedies. This includes in the cases of lone youngsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 90 per cent of the 137,000 children who made it to Italy by sea during the first seven months of the year were not accompanied by adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the numbers attempting the route from Turkey to Greece have fallen, usage of the more dangerous North Africa-Italy route has changed little in a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR said: &quot;If people see no hope and live in fear, then they will continue to gamble their lives making desperate journeys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan was travelling with his older brother Galib, five, mother Rihan and father Abdullah when their boat went down en route to the Greek island of Kos. Abdullah, the only survivor, returned his family's bodies to Kobane in northern Syria for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, he told the BBC the first anniversary of their loss was esp- ecially painful, adding: &quot;At first the world was anxious to help refugees. But this did not even last a month. In fact the situation got worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as the deadly sea crossing, many hundreds, if not thousands, of people are understood to have perished or disappeared while attempting to cross the deserts of Libya and Niger. At an international summit in Paris on Monday, African and European leaders agreed new measures to try to curb migration, including commitments to strengthen border control in Niger and Chad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French President Emmanuel Macron also said an agreed &quot;short-term plan of action&quot; would tackle the people traffickers he said had transformed the Mediterranean into a &quot;cemetery&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura told the Today programme refugee returns to Syria could be on the horizon, predicting Daesh will lose its last remaining stronghold in the country by November, paving the way for new political accord, reconstruction and elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arguing that Syria has entered &quot;the beginning of the end of the war&quot;, he said: &quot;If the international community helps both the opposition and the government by pushing to accept a real negotiation, then within a year it would be a possibility of having a truly credible election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on: &quot;Only an inclusive, political, credible solution will allow that reconstruction and that will be through elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The company is also aspiring to help refugees all over.<BR><BR>Los Angeles, California -- Young travelers frustrated with costly baggage fees on budget flights can finally heave a sigh of relief. A California-based visionary startup is soon to launch a revolutionary backpack which is strategically designed to help travelers avoid the pricey baggage fees on budget airlines. Titled as Sham Bags, the brand is also on the mission to support refugees and displaced people worldwide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company will be donating 10% of the proceeds for the betterment of refugees and unfortunate victims of natural disasters.<BR><BR>&quot;The name 'Sham' is derived from the name of a region in Middle East where a huge number of refugees have gathered for shelter from all over the world. One of our principal missions is to make lives easier for refugees and displaced people in need of help and hence there cannot be a more appropriate name for our brand&quot;, stated Amir Zahlan, the co-founder of the company and the man behind the new inspiring backpack.<BR><BR>Sham Bags' signature travel backpacks are a smart hybrid between technical backpacks and duffel bags. It sports all the features you will find in any technical backpack but also stands out with its hip and strategic design. The backpack conveniently meets the maximum limit on personal items stated by all major domestic and international flights, including budget airlines.<BR><BR>Inside the bag, you will find a spacious main compartment to hold all the major belongings of a traveler and there are extra pockets for little things and trinkets. It's top flap opens up to offer a sneak peek on everything inside the bag.<BR><BR>While approached on the inspiration behind the revolutionary backpack, Mr. Zahlan mentioned of the problem of unavailability of a carry-on backpack for budget airlines in the market.<BR><BR>&quot;We are a team of budget travelers who are always on the spree of affordable traveling. But even though our flights were cheap, we had to end up with pricey baggage fees. The same thing happened in my recent trip to Europe and Jordan that I took to visit my family. With every flight, I was bombarded with baggage fees. It made me search for a functional carry-on backpack for budget airlines that would help to avoid baggage fees and would also sport a cool styling. And to my surprise, there was none. Moreover, I was deeply moved by the plight of Syrian refugees in Jordan. All these factors together inspired me to design a smart travel backpack that fits the requirements for budget airlines and would also help me to give back to the community.&quot;<BR><BR>Mr. Zahlan and his team have designed Sham Bags travel bags with a host of smart features:<BR><BR>*Separate compartment for shoes<BR><BR>*Quick-access padded laptop pocket<BR><BR>*Top-flap zipper<BR><BR>*Organizational pockets to keep all the accessories organized<BR><BR>*Detachable shoulder straps to help the traveler carry the backpack as a duffel bag.<BR><BR>The backpack is expandable as well to fit more for flying any airline.<BR><BR>For more information, please visit https://www.shambags.com<BR><BR>Media Contact<BR><BR>Company Name: Sham Bags<BR><BR>Contact Person: Amir Zahlan<BR><BR>Email: amir@shambags.com<BR><BR>Phone: 1-310-308-9145<BR><BR>Address:Los Angeles, California<BR><BR>Country: United States<BR><BR>Website: http://www.shambags.com<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea could face a refugee crisis if Kim and Trump come to blow </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un trading sabre-rattling threats and North Korea launching nuclear tests, North and South Korea could be faced with the prospect of a disastrous refugee crisis war does break out.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the US managed to wipe out the depraved regime overnight, experts have long said the painful process of a reunification between the North and South would begin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collapse of Kim's state, which has a population of 25 million people, could spark a devastating famine, with the prices of food sky rocketing as the wealthy try to keep food for themselves.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As millions face the prospect of living without their supreme leader, and a lack of money, food and shelter, they too could seek refuge in South Korea putting Seoul under huge pressure.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the North Koreans face the prospect of being treated as second class citizens once integrated into society after entering as poor, uneducated, brainwashed and cut off from the world.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Leonid Petrov, expert in Asian and African studies from the Australian National University, said: &quot;South Korea might use the opportunity to exploit North Koreans who have less education or experience in enterprise.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Millions of North Korean workers could become second class citizens, there could be widespread discrimination, even the border might be kept for years to stop mass immigration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Korea doesn't need its impoverished, aggressive, poorly educated brothers to inundate South Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Petrov told news.com.au the cost of a reunification would be &quot;$3trillion&quot; and an additional &quot;$7-8 trillion in the first decade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the economic burden of a reunification also poses a threat to the younger generations of South Korea who are wholly against it.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seoul resident Choi Wong-chul, 36, said: &quot;If I think of my own children, I don't want there to be reunification.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would just create economic problems that will be too much for my own son's generation too much of a burden.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much so, a push to convince the younger generation of the need for reunification of the two Koreas has seen one political action group Action for Korea United release a song in a desperate bid for unity.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moon Hyun-jin, the biggest sponsor of the campaign, told The Korea Times: &quot;I wanted to make sure unification is an issue that is accessible to young people and wanted them to begin to realise it is something they need to construct.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kakuma refugee camp in north-western Kenya is home to over 180,000 registered refugees and asylum-seekers.<BR><BR>Since 1992 the camp has taken in people fleeing insecurity and conflict from South Sudan, Ethiopia, Burundi, Congo and Somalia. This high population density coupled with the desert terrain presents a major water and sanitation challenge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his role as Technical Lead for a social enterprise organisation called Sanivation, Jack is currently working on a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to provide sustainable sanitation to the camp: 'The objective of the project is inspiring - to sustainably provide proper sanitation, reduce disease and have positive environmental impact, whilst also providing skills and livelihoods. Those impacts are really good motivators to get to work.'<BR><BR>Addressing environmental challenges with great design<BR><BR>Jack and the team have designed an innovative, container-based toilet that diverts away urine and stores faecal sludge in cartridges. These cartridges are collected twice a week by tuk-tuk and taken to a processing site where they are heat treated and mixed with charcoal dust to produce clean-burning charcoal briquettes. These are brought back to the camp and sold as fuel with the revenue used to cover the original cost of collection. The whole process is designed to be sustainable by using renewable energy and local waste products. In the long term, it is also cheaper than traditional pit latrines.<BR><BR>'Seeing something I've personally designed, built and commissioned being operated successfully in such a challenging location is very rewarding.<BR><BR>'The technical design skills I learned at Bath such as heat exchanger design, and pump and pipe sizing have been very useful for this project. As the chemical engineering course was quite broad, we had the opportunity to learn about things like budgeting and management, which I've also made extensive use of.<BR><BR>'Most important of all are the problem-solving skills you develop - the ability to collate information from many different sources and use it to find a way forward comes in useful every day. Materials and skills are very limited here in Kakuma, so when something breaks it's often difficult to think of a way of repairing it; however, with a bit of creativity and flexibility I've found that almost anything can be fixed, and it feels good when you get it working again.'<BR><BR>So far there are 250 households in the camp using the new toilets, but Sanivation hopes to help over 1 million people in East Africa enjoy more sustainable, safe and healthy sanitation by 2020.<BR><BR>The journey to Kakuma<BR><BR>After graduating in 2011 Jack spent a year travelling and volunteered as a Water and Sanitation Engineer for a non-governmental organisation in Orissa, India. He then worked as Process Engineer in South Australia for three years, designing water and wastewater treatment systems at remote mining camps.<BR><BR>Since 2015 he's been based in Kenya. First working as a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Program Manager for a non-governmental organisation and now for Sanivation. In this time he's overseen various programmes and taught water and sanitation courses to local communities.<BR><BR>'I'd like to continue managing projects and developing interesting, sustainable water, sanitation, and renewable energy technology and approaches. I'm looking forward to seeing what approaches and technologies develop in the future and where they can be creatively applied to achieve clean water, sanitation and energy for all.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya refugees from Burma packed into camps and makeshift settlements in Bangladesh have become desperate for scant basic resources and dwindling supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fights are erupting over food and water. Women and children are knocking on car windows or tugging at the clothes of passing reporters while rubbing their bellies and begging for food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN agencies estimate that more than a quarter of a million Rohingya Muslims have arrived in the Cox's Bazar region in just the last two weeks, joining at least 100,000 who were already there after fleeing earlier riots or persecution in Buddhist-majority Burma.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the newly arrived were initially stunned and traumatised after fleeing violence that erupted on August 25 in Burma's Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are now growing desperate as they search for food distribution points that appeared only in recent days, passing out packets of biscuits and 55lb bags of rice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One aid worker who asked not to be identified said &quot;stocks are running out&quot; with the refugees' needs far greater than what they had imagined. &quot;It is impossible to keep up,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one food distribution point, women were volunteering to help keep order by gently tapping people with bamboo sticks to urge them back in line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weary women carried infants in their arms while clutching other children to their sides, afraid of being separated in the crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One 40-year-old man, faint with hunger, collapsed while waiting and could not stand again by himself when others tried to help him up. They drizzled water between his lips in an attempt to revive him, to no avail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is hungry. Everyone has been waiting for hours,&quot; said another aid worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the crowds were becoming unmanageable, and that aid agencies may need to ask for a police presence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not prepared here for such a huge number,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN refugee agency said the number of Rohingya refugees is now estimated at roughly 290,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR spokeswoman Vivian Tan said the number of people arriving continued to grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said with camps already &quot;more than full&quot;, the new arrivals are setting up spontaneous settlements along roadsides or on any available patches of land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said there is an urgent need for more temporary shelters. &quot;We are seeing the mushrooming of these very flimsy shelters that will not be able to house people for too long.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exodus began after Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts in northern Rakhine state. The military responded with what it called &quot;clearance operations&quot; to root out any fighters it said might be hiding in villages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the northwestern Balikesir province's Ayvalik district, 39 Syrians, including 16 children, were held when they attempted to reach Greek islands, the Turkish Coast Guard Command said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coast guard held 60 more Syrians, including 27 children, from a boat off the Altinova district, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suspected human trafficker was also arrested.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the northwestern Edirne province, security forces held 232 migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Syria, Iraq, Algeria, Palestine, Nepal, and Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were reportedly trying to reach Europe through illegal routes. In the Aegean Mugla province's Bodrum district, 22 Syrians were held, while in the Mediterranean Fethiye district the coast guard stopped a boat full of 23 people from Syria and Palestine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 4,800 held in one week for terror, drugs in Turkey Nearly 5,000 suspects have been nabbed in one week across Turkey for terrorism, drug trafficking and smuggling, according to the Interior Ministry Monday.Security forces neutralized 38 terrorists last week in nationwide operations between Nov. 6 and Monday; 16 were killed, 14 detained while eight more surrendered, the ministry's weekly report said.In total, 1,456 operations were carried out against terrorist organisations; 1,167 suspects were arrested for alleged links with terrorist organisation such the PKK, Daesh, the Fetullah Terrorist Organisation (FETO) and far-left organisations.Also, 78 shelters and 21 improvised explosives were destroyed during the counter-terrorism operations in eastern and southeastern provinces of Bingol, Bitlis, Erzurum, Hakkari, Van and Mus.Turkish army shoots down bomb-laden PKK drone. More than 100 PKK terrorists killed in Turkey in one weekThe PKK -- listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the US and the EU -- resumed its armed campaign against Turkey in July 2015. Since then, it has been responsible for the deaths of more than 1,200 Turkish security personnel and civilians, including a number of women and children.Ankara accuses FETO and its US-based leader Fetullah Gulen of having orchestrated the defeated coup attempt of July 15, 2016, which left 250 people martyred and nearly 2,200 injured.Also, security forces seized drugs, smuggled tobacco and fuel during 2,796 anti-narcotics operations across 77 Turkish provinces; 3,682 suspects were also arrested during these operations, according to the statement.As part of cyber-security operations, legal action was also taken against 173 people.Over 80 illegal migrants held off Turkey's Aegean coast. In a crackdown on illegal migration, 6,890 undocumented migrants -- including 527 in Turkish waters -- were held while 110 suspects who allegedly aided them were arrested, the statement added.In a separate incident, early Monday a soldier was injured in a mine explosion in rural area of Bitlis province, according to the regional governor's statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 80 illegal migrants held off Turkey's Aegean coast At least 83 illegal migrants were held off the Aegean coast of Mugla and Aydin provinces while trying to reach Greece, security officials said Friday.In an operation against illegal migrants in Mugla, Turkish Coast Guard teams held 65 Syrian nationals off Gulluk Bay in Milas district, said a source, who asked not to be named due to restrictions on talking to the media.Three others, who are believed to be human traffickers, have also been taken in custody, the source added.In southwestern Aydin province, coast guards held 18 refugees, including Afghan and Syrian nationals, who were trying to reach the Greek islands illegally.In March 2016, Turkey and the EU signed a deal which aimed to discourage irregular migration through the Aegean Sea by taking stricter measures against human traffickers and improving the conditions of some 3 million Syrian refugees in Turkey.Since then, the number of refugees detained crossing the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece has fallen 85 per cent, according to the Turkish Coast Guard.Over 2,500 undocumented migrants held in TurkeyUN: 100 migrants die in Mediterranean Sea in 4 days</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Tamil asylum seeker has become the first person slated for deportation - without having his claim for protection even assessed - after falling foul of the ministerial deadline of 1 October to apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, who has been given the pseudonym Rajah because he remains at risk of being deported, was placed in handcuffs at Villawood detention centre on Wednesday morning and slated for removal in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed he will be flown back to Colombo via Singapore. Returned asylum seekers are, almost invariably, arrested at Bandaranaike airport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Sri Lankan man 'risks torture and rape' if deported from Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rajah arrived in Australia by boat in 2012 seeking asylum, having fled government persecution after Sri Lanka's brutal civil war. His lawyers say he has a credible claim of persecution, based on his Tamil ethnicity and family links to the now-defunct separatist military force the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, also known as the Tamil Tigers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, announced that all asylum seekers who had not yet lodged their claims for protection with the government must do so by 1 October or they would not be considered at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said some were &quot;fake refugees&quot; for whom &quot;the game is up&quot;. &quot;They need to provide the information, they need to answer the questions and then they can be determined to be a refugee or not,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of asylum seekers who had been living in Australia for years had only just had the &quot;bar&quot; to applying for asylum lifted, and the waiting list for legal assistance at refugee legal centres was more than a year in some cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the new applications were put through the so-called &quot;fast-track&quot; process, which removes many of the safeguards and appeals mechanisms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rajah struggled to fill out the 41-page application form in English unassisted, and was not able to access legal assistance before the deadline. Seven thousand asylum seekers were told they needed to meet the 1 October deadline. Rajah was one of 71 who failed to meet the cut-off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With assistance from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, he lodged an application for protection during October but was told he had missed the deadline and his claim would not be assessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His is the first case that has come to public notice of an asylum seeker being forcibly returned to their country of origin without their protection claim being considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Dale, principal solicitor with the Refugee Advice and Casework Service said Australia was setting a dangerous precedent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based on our experience of thousands of cases, this young man has a credible case for protection, an application has been submitted to the department and the department is ignoring that. Their response, in a nutshell, is he failed to meet their deadline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dale said the deadline was &quot;entirely arbitrary&quot; and without any justification. &quot;We told the government, repeatedly, that this would happen, that people, for a number of reasons, would not be able to meet the deadline, and now they risk being returned to a place where they face potential arrest or torture or harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is still legally bound by its non-refoulement obligations under the refugees convention. It cannot return a person to a place &quot; where [their] life or freedom would be threatened &quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The blanket deadline for a group of asylum seekers is unfair and dangerous | Anthea Vogl and Sara Dehm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return of Tamils to postwar Sri Lanka, by Australia and other countries, remains controversial. There has been widespread reportage of the mistreatment and torture of prisoners by Sri Lankan security forces, including the systematic use of rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July the UN's special rapporteur Ben Emmerson visited Sri Lanka and reported that &quot;the use of torture, has been, and remains today, endemic and routine, for those arrested and detained on national security grounds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Entire communities have been stigmatised and targeted for harassment and arbitrary arrest and detention, and any person suspected of association, however indirect, with the LTTE remains at immediate risk of detention and torture,&quot; Emmerson wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrest warrants issued over alleged links to the Tamil Tigers are often seen as highly politicised or based on limited, or no, evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's department of immigration declined to comment on Rajah's case, but has commented on the return of Tamils generally, and its non-refoulement obligations. &quot;Australia does not remove people to Sri Lanka who engage Australia's non-refoulement obligations,&quot; a spokesperson said last week. &quot;Australia takes its non-refoulement obligations seriously.&quot; </SPAN></P>

But film-makers from Michael Haneke to Ai Weiwei have struggled to represent this highly sensitive issue</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Rose</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FILM; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1745 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a moment near the (not particularly happy) ending of Michael Haneke's new film, Happy End, where a group of African refugees turns up uninvited at a posh, exclusively white restaurant in Calais, to the surprise and embarrassment of all concerned. It's the type of predicament Haneke enjoys: the bubble of European bourgeois smugness punctured by a sobering dose of reality. For cinema audiences in affluent parts of the world, it is an equally discomfiting experience. Aren't we just like those restaurant diners, trying to enjoy our leisure time and forget about what's going on outside? Happy End isn't specifically about Europe's migrant crisis, but as Haneke put it in a recent interview: &quot;Calais has become a catchword for all our ignorance about what is happening in the world... We focus so much on our own navels, what's going on all around us is only of peripheral interest.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For European cinema in particular, this is a challenge: how to faithfully represent the migrant situation to people who don't necessarily want to hear about it? The influx of refugees and migrants to the continent over the past five years is surely the biggest upheaval Europe has experienced since the second world war. It has altered the landscape in every way - politically, socially, demographically, even physically, when one thinks of the new borders and fences and refugee camps, such as Calais' notorious &quot;Jungle&quot;. Europe's film-makers have begun to respond, to the extent that a nod to the migrant crisis is almost becoming obligatory at the awards-friendly end of the business. On the face of it, the personal stories of immigrants and refugees are often highly dramatic and therefore ought to make great cinema, but new modes of cinema may be required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Haneke's case, Happy End largely remains within the director's white, bourgeois comfort zone, though that's often tainted by racial guilt (looking back to his 2005 film Hidden, especially). That's a bit of a cake-and-eat-it, for both Haneke - who satirises our indifference to justify his own - and for us, his audience, who can convince ourselves that we're &quot;engaging&quot; with the migrant crisis when we're really just watching a movie about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other film-makers have also been guilty of this, such as Luca Guadagnino, whose A Bigger Splash also interrupted the party of its moneyed, white hedonists with a few intrusions of migrants, who are clearly having a very different time of it on the Sicilian coast. It's telling that A Bigger Splash was a remake of a 1969 French film. Apart from the migrant scenes, the basic template of the original wasn't changed. Guadagnino dodged the issue entirely with his recent followup, Call Me By Your Name - which is set in the 1980s. The film's depiction of a summery, wealthy European idyll is beguiling, but it's an illusion that has become harder to maintain in the present day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter point has been hammered home by recent documentaries. Gianfranco Rosi's Fire at Sea is also set in Sicily, on the island of Lampedusa, many of whose natives have become accustomed to boatloads of migrants arriving on their shores. The final portion of the film is particularly shocking, with the film-maker boarding a boat full of traumatised, sick, dehydrated survivors, and many dead bodies. Up in the hills, meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes might be dancing around the pool in A Bigger Splash. Fire At Sea was praised for its empathic, non-judgmental observation, and won the Golden Bear at the 2016 Berlin film festival. Its humane focus was almost exclusively trained on the islanders, however. By contrast, the migrants are practically a faceless, nameless mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same is even more true of Ai Weiwei's new documentary, Human Flow, which chronicles our era of unprecedented human migration, visiting 23 countries around the world. Weiwei gets his hands dirty; we often see him filming the unfolding misery on his mobile phone. He can do little more than bear witness, and perhaps that's enough. His global celebrity as an artist will hopefully attract attention to the subject. &quot;I don't see myself as any different from them,&quot; he says. &quot;We may speak totally different languages and have totally different belief systems but I understand them. Like me, they are also afraid of the cold and don't like standing in the rain or being hungry. Like me, they need a sense of security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recurring theme of Human Flow is how displaced peoples are deprived not only of their homes, security and possessions, but also of their identity as individuals. In conveying the scale of the problem, Human Flow often has no choice but to exacerbate that. The film's most memorable images are often taken from the air or from elevated camera angles, uncomfortably reminiscent of wildlife programmes such as Blue Planet: a boatload of migrants dwarfed by the open sea; a vast Jordanian refugee &quot;city&quot; where people are reduced to ants; lines of people crossing rivers in rural Greece like a migrating herd, on their march to what will be a closed border. There are also harrowing individual testimonies - &quot;Where am I supposed to start my life?&quot; pleads a sick, weeping mother who has walked for 60 days with her son. The film challenges us to multiply one by the other. The maths is impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's an absence of a human element from most portrayals of migrants, argues Lily Parrott, co-founder of the London Migration film festival. &quot;Representations of migration groups is very binary: in extreme terms, usually as enemies or as victims. And we view these overly simplistic portrayals of peoples to be equally dehumanising in different ways. To reduce people to very simplistic categories is to take away the very things that make them human. We want to problematise and complicate this idea of migrations as something that happens separately from the human experience. Migration is the human experience.&quot;The festival, now in its second year, is one of a growing number of cultural events seeking to discuss, debate and give voice to different perspectives on the migration (the annual Refugee Week is another). The majority of migration is not from the global north to the global south, they point out, and 80% of migrants move to a neighbouring country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of what cinema can do, there's often value in conveying the point of view of the migrants themselves, rather than those affected by it. It wasn't that long ago that British cinema had a knack for this, when one thinks back to acclaimed films such as 2000's Last Resort (concerning a Russian, asylum-seeking single mother in Margate), or Michael Winterbottom's 2002 docudrama In This World (following two Afghan refugees from Pakistan to London), or Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things, which cleverly packaged the London immigrant experience into an &quot;underworld&quot; thriller. That tradition looks to be returning, judging by two very different recent hits: God's Own Country  and  Paddington.God's Own Country wasn't overtly about capturing the immigrant experience, which is perhaps why it did it so well. The sensual, image-led story is tightly focused on the growing passion between a closeted farmer's son and the Romanian hired hand, and barely touches on national politics, being set in a remote farmstead in the scenic Yorkshire Dales (its maker, Francis Lee, wrote the story before the Brexit referendum). Just a few xenophobic encounters left the overall impression that it's easier to be gay in modern-day Britain than to be an eastern European immigrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paddington and its sequel are a very different beast, but in their abstracted way, they successfully sweeten the pill of the immigrant experience to suit family palettes. To do that without diluting the principles of tolerance, empathy and civility is no small achievement. Fashioning migrant and refugee stories - which often entail suffering and misery - into mainstream entertainment is a difficult circle to square, but given the culture-clash potential, it's not impossible. The biggest German-language hit of last year was Wilkommen Bei Den Hartmanns, or Welcome To Germany. This broad farce followed a Nigerian refugee's entry into a wealthy, white Munich family, with an even-handed cast of characters ranging from liberal do-gooders to xenophobic conservatives, Pegida-style nationalists to Islamist sympathisers. The movie was well-timed, coming just after Angela Merkel's decision to admit some 1 million refugees into Germany, though its intentions were somewhat undermined by the omission of the Nigerian actor's name (Eric Kabongo) from the poster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there's one film-maker who has proved to be equipped to handle the migrant crisis on film, it is Finland's Aki Kaurismaki, whose last two films have dealt squarely with European refugees, and, crucially given them their humanity. This is all the more surprising given Kaurismaki's favoured mode of stylised deadpan comedy. His films are full of artful artificiality, dry absurdity and retro fashions - particularly from the 1950s. But the European heritage Kaurismaki evokes is not the nationalist fantasy of &quot;whites only&quot; and closed borders, but one of postwar optimism and civility and openness to outside influences. His 2011 film Le Havre evokes the humanist France of Jean Renoir or Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut in its tale of townsfolk conspiring to hide an African boy from the authorities - he could be a Jewish kid in a second world war film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's followup, The Other Side of Hope, was set in Finland but it feels like the same Kaurismaki country. The story involves a Syrian refugee this time, Khaled, who arrives in the country by accident and immediately checks in with the authorities, who listen sympathetically to his harrowing tale of persecution. But then Khaled is adopted and employed by a retired shirt salesman attempting to open a sushi restaurant. Neither of them know the first thing about sushi, but that's OK. If the African migrants from Happy End walked into The Other Side of Hope's sushi restaurant, you feel they would be offered a table straight away, or a job. Kaurismaki's films are possibly closer to Paddington than Ai Weiwei's documentary in terms of hard-hitting realism, but where other modes of cinema have failed, his eccentric, personal style is somehow robust enough to address the issues of the age, satisfy entertainment demands, and respect both its subjects and its audience. We all come out of it feeling more human. Perhaps that's the best cinema can hope to achieve.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1974 the parliament passed the Trade Practices Act which, by section 52, decreed that a corporation should not &quot;engage in conduct which is misleading or deceptive&quot;. But parliamentarians are not subject to similar restrictions. We accept without questioning that norms of conduct, which parliamentarians set for commerce, do not apply to them. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people expect politicians to lie. But few politicians have shown the capacity for dishonesty and hypocrisy which Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton have displayed in connection with people seeking asylum.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott, Morrison, Turnbull and Dutton claim to be Christians, along with most other members of the Australian parliament. For fear of being misunderstood, I should declare that I was brought up in the Christian tradition, but I no longer adhere to any religion. However, I do remember some of the fundamental tenets of Christian teaching: compassion for those in need; treat others as you would want to be treated ... </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These men lie to us, when they call boat people &quot;illegal&quot;. It is not an offence to arrive in Australia without a visa, seeking to be protected from persecution. And by their wilful mistreatment of people seeking asylum they betray the Christian values they pretend to hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bible tells the parable of the good Samaritan. A Jewish traveller on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho has been stripped and beaten and left helpless beside the road. A priest and a Levite both pass him by and avoid engaging with him. A Samaritan sees him and helps him, even though Jews and Samaritans were traditional enemies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott, who claims to be a Roman Catholic, once suggested that the parable of the good Samaritan might have been different if a number of travellers had been found beside the road. It takes someone like Abbott to claim that he can reconstruct Christs's teaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Tony Abbott needs to go back to Bible class if he quotes it on climate change | Geoff Thompson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott had earlier exposed his bankrupt version of Christianity when he gave the second Margaret Thatcher Lecture in London on 27 October 2015. Among other things he said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Implicitly or explicitly, the imperative to 'love your neighbour as you love yourself' is at the heart of every Western polity. It expresses itself in laws protecting workers, in strong social security safety nets, and in the readiness to take in refugees. It's what makes us decent and humane countries as well as prosperous ones, but - right now - this wholesome instinct is leading much of Europe into catastrophic error.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, a wholesome instinct is sidelined because of its consequences. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same speech, Abbott said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... no country or continent can open its borders to all comers without fundamentally weakening itself. This is the risk that the countries of Europe now run through misguided altruism. On a somewhat smaller scale, Australia has faced the same predicament and overcome it. The first wave of illegal arrivals to Australia peaked at 4,000 people a year, back in 2001, before the Howard government first stopped the boats: by processing illegal arrivals offshore; by denying them permanent residency; and in a handful of cases, by turning illegal immigrant boats back to Indonesia. The second wave of illegal boat people was running at the rate of 50,000 a year - and rising fast - by July 2013, when the Rudd government belatedly reversed its opposition to offshore processing; and then my government started turning boats around, even using orange lifeboats when people smugglers deliberately scuttled their vessels.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Incidentally, in addition to his lie about &quot;illegal boat people&quot;, his figures were false. The Australia Parliament House library shows that the largest number of boat people to come to Australia in a single year was just short of 25,000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull converted to Roman Catholicism. He has not tried to reinterpret Christ's teaching, but he has embraced Abbott's practical lessons in morality by embracing his policy of mistreating refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Pope Francis took a more principled stand on the need for compassion for the plight of asylum seekers: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biblical revelation urges us to welcome the stranger; it tells us that in so doing, we open our doors to God, and that in the faces of others we see the face of Christ himself.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, neither Abbott nor Turnbull appear to have listened to the Pope or understood the Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrison's maiden speech in parliament placed great emphasis on his Christian values. Among other things he said: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From my faith I derive the values of loving-kindness, justice and righteousness, to act with compassion and kindness, acknowledging our common humanity and to consider the welfare of others; to fight for a fair go for everyone to fulfil their human potential and to remove whatever unjust obstacles stand in their way, including diminishing their personal responsibility for their own wellbeing; and to do what is right, to respect the rule of law, the sanctity of human life and the moral integrity of marriage and the family. We must recognise an unchanging and absolute standard of what is good and what is evil.... These are my principles.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If those are Morrison's principles, he certainly doesn't seem to live by them. During his time as immigration minister he showed no trace of &quot;loving kindness&quot; or justice or compassion for refugees who came to Australia by boat looking for protection from persecution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton claims to be Christian, but he boycotted Kevin Rudd's apology to the stolen generations in February 2008. Like other members of Coalition governments during the past 16 years, he refers to boat people as &quot;illegal&quot;, and he administers a system of detention which shows astonishing cruelty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The leaked transcript of Turnbull's call with Trump shows him at his worst | Julian Burnside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the place to give details of Australia's mistreatment of refugees; the facts are known well enough. Equally well-known is the Coalition's message that a harsh refugee policy is essential to protect refugees from the risk of drowning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to suggest that they are worried about refugees drowning is a lie: a fig-leaf to make immoral mistreatment look compassionate. We're so worried that, if refugees don't drown, we call them &quot;illegal&quot; and punish them as if they were criminals. We do it explicitly as a deterrent so that others will not try to find safety in Australia. And these dishonest politicians, pretending to be motivated by compassion, overlook altogether that if persecuted people stand their ground and are killed by their persecutors, they are still dead - just as if they drowned; if they die in an attempt to escape to some other country, they are still dead - just as if they drowned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For politicians like Abbott, Turnbull, Morrison and Dutton to say they are worried about boat people drowning is a lie. For them to mistreat asylum seekers in the way they do is a betrayal of the Christian values they cherish. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are dishonest hypocrites.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voyage across the Ban al-Mandab, the narrow strait that separates Africa from the Arabian peninsula at the mouth of the Red Sea, takes little more than two hours in calm seas.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Salah al Alimi and Armani Sharabi, a married couple from Yemen's inland capital of Sanaa who clambered aboard a tiny fishing vessel late last Thursday afternoon, that was long enough.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a big swell. We both got sea sick,&quot; Mr Alimi, a 35-year-old-artist and interior decorator, said in an interview in the tent the family now call home. Saiga, their five month old daughter, slept blissfully through her parents' ordeal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at least they were safe. Days earlier, they had fled their home in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, following an eruption of fighting between Houthi rebels and followers of the former president Abdullah Ali Saleh.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djibouti is no land of milk and honey.&nbsp; Made up of stunning landscapes of sand and volcanic rock, the former French colony is poor, its capital paradoxically expensive to live in, and it's very hot, with temperatures here hitting 50&deg;C&nbsp;in summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However,&nbsp;it is the closest place of safety for many Yemenis made homeless by their country's ongoing war.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, estimates 38,000 people have made the journey across the straits since 2016, with about 20 people arriving each day.&nbsp; They come from across Yemen, but few hang around long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Markazi refugee camp, which all new arrivals come through and where the Alimi family are now living, can hold up to 5,000 people but was only half full when the Telegraph visited last week.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About four thousand more Yemenis are living outside the camp, mostly working or living with relatives and friends in Djibouti City, the capital.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN representatives in Obock, the remote northwestern province nearest to Yemen and the site of the camp, are now are revising contingency plans following a recent surge in violence.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Djibouti is not a place they are very keen to come. They find it a bit remote and poor compared to their country. That is why we think they will mostly relocate inside Yemen,&quot;&nbsp;said Abdoulaye Barry - UNHCR representative in Djibouti.&nbsp; &quot;Only those who have no option, or are in serious danger, will try to come,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A modestly well off urban family, the Alimis had until a few weeks ago opted to see out the war in Sanaa.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition were a constant threat, wages have not been paid in months, and soaring inflation and a creeping food shortages forced them to first sell Mrs Alimi's gold jewellery, and then everything else of value in the house, in order to survive.&nbsp; With no street fighting, it had seemed relatively safe compared to much of the rest of the country.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That all changed at the beginning of December, when Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former president of Yemen, split from his Houthi rebel allies and said he was ready to make terms with the internationally recognised government and its Saudi backers. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yemeni capital promptly erupted in violence as the Houthis and Saleh's Republican Guard turned on one another.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We lived very near to Saleh's house, so the fighting was close,&quot; said Mrs Sharabi, 23. &quot;We were stuck for two days. No one was allowed out because [the Houthis] assumed any movement in that area was linked to Saleh. When they fired RPGs at his house, the shrapnel would hit ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Photo dispatch: Yemeni refugees flee to Djibouti                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 48 terrifying hours trapped amid the fighting, the Houthis - who had taken the upper hand in the battle - ordered everyone in the area to evacuate.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They came round one afternoon with a megaphone saying everyone leave the area because everything here will be destroyed,&quot; said Mr Alimi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a five-month old daughter, so we decided to just go. We weren't waiting around to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They spent a small fortune on buses and taxis to cross the front lines and reach the coast, where a fisherman took pity on them and ferried them across the strait for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple is fairly sure their house in Sanaa has been destroyed.&nbsp; Home for now is the Markazi refugee camp - a windswept grid of tents and containers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Run by the Djiboutian government with assistance from the UNHCR, Markazi is a magnet for the largess of nations eager to be showing their bit to ease the crisis in Yemen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refugees sleep on union jack emblazoned blankets and eat from tins marked USAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the tents, and 250 new air conditioned, shipping-container style units, have been provided by Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; There is a playground, rudimentary but functioning sanitation, and a volunteer centre for the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   At a glance | Yemen                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite international donations, it is not an easy place to live.&nbsp; The plateau is arid, and Djibouti City, the centre of economic activity, is two-hour boat ride or gruelling four-hour drive through lava fields and mountains.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few Yemenis speak French, the local lingua franca, making employment difficult. &nbsp; The family's tent is bare. They sleep on the floor beneath a mosquito net and worry about scorpions - they've already killed three.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Life in Saana was so comfortable. So this is very different. It is so difficult now. Everything has changed,&quot; sighed Mr Alimi.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, some people have made themselves semi-permanent homes and many Yemeni refugees have integrated into Djiboutian society, opening restaurants and forming a tight-knit, community in Djibouti City.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hassan Abdu Hassan, a 65 year old baker who brought his wife and four of their children over the straits in 2015, has been in the camp for over two years.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Saleh timeline Yemen                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When coalition airstrikes began to pummel his home city of Taiz, he initially tried to stay in Yemen, moving his family to village on the Red Sea coast where they hoped to stay until the war ended.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after six months the war caught up with them.&nbsp;They crossed the strait with other refugees in the boat of a fisherman who agreed to ferry them over the free.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, he says, he has been living in limbo, relying on handouts at the refugee camp and unable to find work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would like to go home, but Taiz remains a battleground, and several relatives who stayed behind are dead. His brother in law and 12-year-old-nephew were killed by an artillery rocket, and two nieces in an airstrike.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were just walking down the street. The Saudis were bombing a Houthi position. They destroyed their target, the shrapnel killed the girls,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't even know who is right or wrong in this war anymore. I just want it to stop,&quot; he added. In their tent, the Alimis feel similarly helpless. &quot;Of course we'd like to go back. But it gets worse every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is a Rohingya Muslim from the Rahine province in the north of Myanmar. She sold everything she owns, even her tiny gold earrings, to fund her escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After walking for eight days, she gave birth at the border of neighbouring Bangladesh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She walked for two days more. On arrival at the chaotic, overcrowded mudbathrefugee camp, she collapsed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;She lost her flip flops along the way. She and the kids all arrived barefoot after walking through forests, jungles and rivers. She came here with nothing at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've never seen anything like it. She carried a newborn baby for another two days then slumped down in this horrendous camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are so many more stories like that. How did she manage to be so strong, to make it? People are tough when they are fleeing for their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zia, who was brought up in Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow, runs CARE International's operation  in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity response from Scotland has been resounding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charity Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (SCIAF) are sending &pound;50,000 to their sister agency Caritas Bangladesh, who are helping more than 160,000 people who have fled into the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alistair Dutton, director of SCIAF, said: &quot;The Rohingya people are going through hell and desperately need our help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than 480,000 people - roughly the population of Edinburgh - have fled for their lives into Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many have experienced horrific violence and the destruction of their homes and villages. They are traumatised, vulnerable and desperately need our help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charity bosses say the refugees are living in extremely difficult conditions, with a massive and immediate increase in humanitarian assistance needed to save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also an urgent need to get food and items such as pots, pans, soap and jerry cans to thousands in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen Disasters Emergency Committee member charities have come together to call for funds to respond to the needs of those affected by what the United Nations describe as&quot;textbook ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Rohingya insurgents attacked army posts in August, the state responded with terrifying force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have reported rape, infanticide, brutal beatings and people being burned alive. Satellite images show 200 villages have been burned to the ground. In this huge movement of terrified people, families have been split up. Zia estimates women and children make up 60 per cent of the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the camp, women are too scared to leave their makeshift shelters. Children walk around the sprawling camp, searching for their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zia said: &quot;Every day we see children wandering around endlessly. The community are trying to look after them but basically they've lost their folks, they can't find their mum and dad, they don't know if they're alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women stay at the back of the camp, they don't come out, they're traumatised and they're scared. They've lost their husband. They've been through horror to get to this place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a huge number of elderly people, lots of people with disabilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zia and his staff are picking their way through the mud, helping the refugees. The camp is enormous. Yesterday it took one medical worker two hours to walk from one end to another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;We are going shack to shack, tent to tent, plastic to plastic, to see just who's in there, talk to them and find out what their needs are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions have improved, slightly, sinceCAREand other aid agencies arrived. Zia said: &quot;Four weeks ago, we were on the roadside giving out umbrellas. Now we can go quite deep inside the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We started with cooked food. Now people have got a little tiny shelter and a little tiny stove we are giving them rice to cook for themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next stage in the relief effort is to improve the shacks and basic hygiene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rutherglen mosque raises thousands of pounds for refugees fleeing war zone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zia added: &quot;We need proper shelters, with high-quality plastic and bamboo. And we need to get a more balanced diet, most people are just getting rice and they can't survive on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so many vulnerable people crammed into a tiny space, Zia fears an epidemic could break out at any time. He said: &quot;There are hardly any toilets at all - two or three for a thousand people. So people don't use them, they go outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children who were born here have not been vaccinated and we don't know how many were vaccinated in Myanmar. We're worried about the outbreak of disease so we are trying to vaccinate children fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his 20 years of humanitarian work, these are the worst scenes Zia has seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the sheer number of people in such a small space. At times you feel like you're in a football crowd, there are so many people crammed together round the aid distribution points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then you go into the camp and it's tent after tent after tent, you can't walk between them they're so tightly packed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This would stretch any country and Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very rarely movements of people on this scale. In 20 years of working with refugees I've never seen anything like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The childhad reportedly been struggling to help care for his six siblings at the camp in Baden, south of Vienna, where they had lived since last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He died a day after being taken to hospital in the capital, police said. They did not reveal how he had taken his life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austrian ombudsman Guenther Kraeuter announced an inquiry into the boy's death following claims, reported by public broadcaster Oe1, that authorities had been aware of the family's difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austrian media reported that the boy had been left in charge of his siblings by his 23-year-old brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities said they noticed &quot;nothing unusual&quot;.The boy's death appeared to be the latest in a wave of suicides among young refugees in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's children agency Unicef has denounced &quot;the lack of protective measures for migrant children in Europe&quot;, accusing EU member states of doing &quot;much too little&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watchwarned in July that a deal struck by the EU to slow refugee boat crossings to Greece was driving levels of suicide and self-harm upwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum seekers detained on islands in the Aegean Sea described how they saw people setting themselves on fire, hanging themselves and cutting their wrists in desperation at their squalid living, according to a report by the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of asylum seekers, including children, reported rising anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental illnesses as they were forced to wait months on end in &quot;horrific conditions&quot; to see if they would be granted passage to the Greek mainland or deported to Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There havebeen reports that Afghan refugees are sometimes treated as &quot;second class&quot; in comparison to Syrians by Western governments, with the asylum process for Afghans reportedly taking much longer due to a belief that many Afghans are not forced to leave their homes but rather are economic migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1979, Afghanistan has ranked between four and five out of five on the political terror scale, a measurement developed by political scientist Mark Gibney. Level five is the highest and is defined as a condition where: &quot;Terror has expanded to the whole population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, there were around 2.7 million Afghan refugees - the world's second-largest group after Syrians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suicide rates among Afghan teens in Sweden are reported to have soared following the implementation of tougher suicide rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a two week period in January and February this year, seven unaccompanied minors were reported to have attempted suicide in different housing centres across the Scandinavian country - with three of them dying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austria has received almost 150,000 asylum claims since 2015, making the wealthy nation of 8.75 million one of the highest recipients per capita in Europe's migration crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The far-right Freedom Party is expected to enter Austria's government in coalition with the centre-rightPeople's Party (OVP) following the recent election where the electorate lurched decisively to the right following concerns over immigration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Nina Grunfeld</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince William recently visited the Imperial War Museum to discuss the launch of the next phase of its privately funded Second World War and Holocaust galleries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe this news didn't reach the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation, which yesterday announced the winner of a competition to build its own education centre and memorial just half a mile away from the museum in Victoria Tower Gardens by the Houses of Parliament - and funded to a cost of &pound;50 million by us, the unsuspecting taxpayers .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you suggest a new Holocaust memorial and learning centre ought not to be built, you don't feel very popular. And when the likes of Natasha Kaplinsky, Alex Salmond and the Chief Rabbi are the powers behind the project, you don't feel you have a chance to stop it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this story is not as black-and-white as it might appear and, as the daughter of German Jewish refugees, I don't believe the memorial or the learning centre belong in their proposed location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course a Holocaust memorial is an admirable idea, but the decision to build it in a park so close to the Imperial War Museum is ludicrous. The museum already has an unbelievably moving Holocaust exhibition and has its own plans for a stunning new exhibition centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It bid to be the location of the memorial, and its&nbsp;Foster-and-Partners-designed plans, including an incredibly moving wall of remembrance inscribed with the names of Holocaust victims, were reminiscent of Rachel Whiteread's Holocaust Memorial in Vienna. The museum has artefacts and content. This new scheme has nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The holocaust memorial in ViennaCredit:      Herwig Prammer/Reuters     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poorly conceived project was decided upon a couple of years ago by David Cameron when, one can only presume, he wanted to emphasise his party's diversity. There is no public record of the research that decided on Victoria Tower Gardens as the perfect site, no record of the decision-making process at all. All we know is that Peter Bazalgette was handed &pound;50 million and they decided to build over and under a park next to Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relevance of the proximity to Parliament is apparently that the Holocaust and treatment of refugees is a subject close to the hearts of British politicians. But how true is that? Think for a moment about the British relationship with the Holocaust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain took in refugees to shelter them from Nazi atrocities. But not only were the British very late to open their doors to Jewish refugees, they were also quick to close them - my uncle and aunt were too late and ended up in Colombia. Plus, after the war, I had to live through an era (is it really over?) when my school had a Jewish quota, as did many of the clubs I might normally have belonged to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other problems, too. Living almost next to Parliament, as I do, you are not only part of a community as local and friendly as any around the world but you are far more aware than most of pollution, traffic accidents, guns, terrorism and road blocks. So close to Parliament and Westminster Abbey, this is not a part of London that needs another potential target. And will we not mourn the unnecessary removal of a much-loved park?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another proposed design for the memorialCredit:      Ron Arad Architects/Adjaye Associates&nbsp;     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The park has many memorials in it already: one commemorating the abolition of slavery, another the Suffragettes, and yet another a stunning statue by Rodin of the Burghers of Calais. All illustrate the good that can come out of evil. No positives came out of the Holocaust - there is still hatred in the world and genocide is still going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This memorial will cost &pound;50 million that could have been put towards a good cause: rescuing a few more refugees or, if we want to stick to the Holocaust theme, commemorating British people who took in refugee Jews. The amazing Stolpersteine - brass cubes inscribed with the names and lives of victims of Nazi persecution - that we see on streets all over Europe could be used to thank Britons for taking in Jews like my parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For obvious reasons, I am aware of anti-Semitism and the effects of prejudice. But I am not convinced that a memorial and learning centre right next to Parliament is going to give Jews a good name. On the contrary, it links Jews with the destruction of a precious park, and with taking &pound;50 million for a project that could have been used to help others instead. The Imperial War Museum is already building a home for memories of Jewish suffering. Don't diffuse that focus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD; Version:2</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">541 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union is taking the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to court for failing to accommodate their fair share of refugees under a plan agreed to by the 28-country bloc two years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU nations agreed in September 2015 to relocate 160,000 refugees from Italy and Greece as the countries buckled under the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the plan, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic were supposed to take in a combined 10,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Hungary and Poland have taken none at all, while the Czech Republic has accepted 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's executive commission sought reasons why but said it was given no satisfactory explanations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission said the three &quot;remain in breach of their legal obligations&quot; and &quot;have given no indication that they will contribute to the implementation of the relocation decision&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their cases are being referred to Europe's top tribunal, the Court of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee relocation plan was adopted in a legally binding vote by a majority of EU member states, but not the three refusing to take part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan never worked well and, as of last week, only around 32,000 refugees had been relocated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute has highlighted the deep divisions among Europeans over how best to handle the migrant wave, which saw more than one million people enter Europe in 2015, mostly from Turkey to the Greek islands and across the Mediterranean to Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also undermined trust among EU partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's second in command, vice-president Frans Timmermans, said he did his utmost to avoid legal action and that the three could still do something about it as a few thousand people in the Greek islands remain eligible to be distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Going to court is always the instrument of last resort. That's not what we want,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope we still find a way out through an act of participation by these three countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Poland is intransigent, with foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski saying the government is not changing its policy on migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing has changed. Our position is clear: we do not agree with the solution that the European Union proposed two years ago,&quot; he told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Czech Republic seemed more conciliatory, with newly appointed Prime Minister Andrej Babis telling the local CTK news agency that he wants to negotiate with the commission to get the legal action lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate move, the commission also referred Hungary to the Court of Justice over two other laws, one on higher education and the other on non-governmental institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both cases, Hungary has failed to address EU concerns about the laws or amend the legislation to bring it in line with EU standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the core of both laws are the Hungarian government's efforts to curtail the influence of Hungarian-American financier George Soros in Hungary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Viktor Orban considers Mr Soros a key political foe, mainly because of their diverging views on migration.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of said risks, donor and multilateral capital has and will continue to bridge Lebanon's infrastructure funding gap. Underscoring the scale of the country's infrastructure investment needs, the Lebanese government announced in April 2017 that it is seeking USD10 - 12bn in infrastructure investment over the next seven years. In this vein, we highlight various infrastructure-focused initiatives announced in the past year backed by multi-lateral institutions and international donors:  The World Bank has earmarked USD200mn to upgrade the road network in Lebanon. The funds will be used to renovate about 500km of roads in the first phase of the government's larger plan to rehabilitate the road sector.   The United States has pledged USD140mn to help Syrian refugees and the communities hosting them, with much of these funds slated to target the construction of new water and waste-water treatment infrastructure.   Lebanon, in collaboration with the EU, has launched two five-year programmes, dubbed SWAM I and SWAM II, to create and improve waste management infrastructure throughout the country. The EU will fund both programmes, which involve a total cost of USD38.14mn.   Lebanon became a shareholding member of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in May 2017, which should open the door for additional infrastructure funding in the coming years. According to the EBRD, projects focusing on delivering a sustainable, reliable source of electricity and those promoting the more efficient delivery of public services will be an investment priority.   </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Private Finance A Limited Factor</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are less optimistic that the private sector will be able to replicate the impact of donor funding. We note that Lebanon-based </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FFA Private Bank</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announced in June 2017 that it intends to launch a structured investment vehicle to channel roughly USD1bn into the country's water, waste-to-energy, and renewable infrastructure segments; however, without the appropriate avenues to deploy this capital into viable projects, we do not expect that capital raised will necessarily translate into tangible project activity. Embodying the regulatory difficulties the private sector will face in investing in infrastructure, a comprehensive Public Private Partnership (PPP) law that would allow for the Higher Council for Privatization to develop and procure projects has remained in limbo since 2007. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2015 agreement ended a 12-year, international diplomatic crisis over Iran's nuclear weapons programme. After 20 months of deliberations, the country agreed to get rid of their uranium stockpile, and allow international observers oversee their nuclear programme. Awarding the Peace Prize to the deal's authors would reward these effortswhile sendinga strong message to Mr Trump, who is reportedly planning to decertify the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Committee is serious about reaching Mr Trump, however, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has suggested awarding the prize to the American Civil Liberties Union. The nonprofit advocacy group has mounted some of the most effective legal challenges to Mr Trump's policies since he took office, and have seen a surge in donations in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Chelsea Manning poses with an ACLU sign ACLU/Twitter)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee may choose to target to another world leader, however, by awarding the prize to Turkish journalist Can D&uuml;ndar. Mr D&uuml;ndar, the former editor of Turkey's Cumhuriyet newspaper, was convicted of espionage and aiding a terrorist group due tohis groundbreaking reporting. He currently lives in exile in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen of Mr D&uuml;ndar's former Cumhuriyet co-workers have also been put on trial for aiding a terrorist organisation. Awarding the prize to Mr D&uuml;ndar, or Cumhuriyet as a whole, would be a strong rebuke of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's media crack-down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another journalist floated for the prize is Raif Badawi, a Saudi writer who was arrested in June 2012 for &quot;insulting Islam&quot; online and on television. He was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes, of which he has received 50. The award would send a similar message to the Saudi government about the importance of press freedoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rounding out listis one of last year's top contenders, the Syrian Civil Defence (better known as the White Hats). The group, nicknamed the for helmets they wear to protect themselves, rescues civilians in Syria from bombed-out buildings. They claim to have saved 99,000 people over course of the country's six-year civil war. While they were passed over for the prize last year, they've since had a poignant - and very convincing - documentary made about their work.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divisions over migration marred a show of unity at an EU summit on Thursday, after Germany and Italy hit back at plans that could spell the end of mandatory refugee quotas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have led criticism of a proposal from the European council president Donald Tusk, who has described refugee quotas as &quot;divisive and ineffective&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, whose country has struggled to manage large numbers of refugees and migrants, criticised Tusk's comments as &quot;aimless, ill-timed and pointless&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving at the EU summit in Brussels, German chancellor Angela Merkel said there &quot;cannot be selective solidarity&quot; among EU member states.&quot; Germany gave refuge to more than 1m asylum seekers in 2015 and has been championing the policy of sharing refugees through quotas, when numbers could overwhelm over other countries. &quot;We need solidarity not just in regulating and steering migration,&quot; Merkel said, &quot;but we also need internal solidarity&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The row threatens to overshadow an EU summit that insiders hoped would be a show of unity, as leaders launch landmark plans for greater military cooperation and bask in a common position on the first phase of Brexit talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only three countries - Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic - came out in favour of Tusk's plan ahead of the summit. Slovakia, the other member of the Visegr&aacute;d quartet, which recently held the EU's rotating presidency, did not side with its neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Czech Republic's new prime minister Andrej Babis said any attempt to impose &quot;nonsensical&quot; quotas in a majority vote would only widen the divisions in the EU. &quot;It won't happen.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poland's new prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he was happy that Poland's opposition to allowing refugees into Europe seemed to be gaining more acceptance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poland, along with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, pledged (EURO)35m (&pound;30m) for Italian-led projects to protect the border at Libya, as part of EU efforts to stem the flow of people attempting the dangerous journey to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni welcomed the financial contribution but said the four countries still needed to accept refugees. &quot;We will continue to insist that a commitment on the relocation of refugees is needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials have been even blunter in private: one European diplomat told his counterparts that Tusk's paper should be put in the bin. Another diplomatic source said it was very badly written and &quot;much too unbalanced in favour&quot; of central Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, another EU diplomat, from a country supporting quotas, said it was &quot;time to attack the issue&quot;, which was &quot;starting to poison&quot; other debates. &quot;At this point in time, what I am expecting is a good old bust up and in a later phase we will narrow the field of possible outcomes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU is not aiming to reach conclusions on this thorny issue at the summit. &quot;Divisions are accompanied by emotions which make it hard to find even a common language and rational arguments for this debate,&quot; Tusk said, referring to the chasm of opinion on migration, but also the future of the single currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU leaders agreed on compulsory quotas at the height of the migration crisis in 2015, despite opposition from four central and eastern european countries. The bloc is discussing whether to make quotas a permanent feature of the EU's asylum system, but the proposals have been making slow progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tusk plan, reported by the Guardian earlier this week, took countries by surprise and is seen as out of step with months of work done by EU home affairs ministers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European commission, backed by several member states, has also been infuriated by what it sees as a march onto its turf of proposing EU laws and policies. In his letter to leaders, Tusk said he would present &quot;a way forward for consideration by leaders&quot; after June 2018 if there was no consensus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The European council [that Tusk leads] is not a legislative body,&quot; said an EU diplomat. &quot;I don't think he can mean we should bypass our normal procedures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has also been irritated by Tusk's claim that the 2015 quota system was a failure. &quot;The commission firmly disagrees with the statement that relocation as an emergency response has been 'ineffective',&quot; a spokeswoman said. &quot;Over 32,000 people have been relocated - over 90% of all those eligible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission said member states should be working towards a European approach. &quot;Returning to a pre-crisis mode of isolated, uncoordinated, national action is not an option and would betray years' worth of collective work to better the collective European response to managing migration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK, which has an opt-out from this part of EU asylum policy, has been sitting on the sidelines of the debate and has never taken part in mandatory refugee relocation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dangerous new route for refugees trying to reach Europe is thought to have opened up in the Black Sea, which coastguards in Romania are warning could prove more deadly than the current Mediterranean crossings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As neighbouring countries struggle with the refugee crisis that has seen millions flee conflicts in the Middle East, Romania has largely been bypassed. However the past few days suggest its waters are being eyed by smugglers keen to avoid crackdowns elsewhere. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, the Romanian coastguard intercepted a fishing boat in the Black Sea with 97 migrants on board, 36 of them children. Border police said that they were Iranian and Iraqi nationals, picked up close to the Romanian-Bulgarian sea border. The evening before, coastguards had spotted another boat heading for Romanian territorial waters. The fishing boat, carrying around 120 people, was intercepted by border police and handed over to Turkish coastguards. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 3 September, a fishing boat carrying 87 migrants, was stopped as it sailed towards the Romanian coast on the Black Sea. That boat is believed to have set out from the northern coast of Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Facebook removes posts made by people smugglers aiming to lure migrants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coastguard had also intercepted a boat with 68 asylum seekers off the Romanian coast on 21 August and a few days later, 150 Syrian refugees were discovered boarding a fishing boat in Turkey heading for Romania. On 13 August the coastguard had found 69 Iraqi migrants in a boat in Romanian waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these are still small numbers compared with the hundreds of thousands who have made the perilous crossing between Turkey and Greece, it could still be a significant development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romania's interior minister, Carmen Dan, visited the Black Sea border police last week. &quot;We treat migrants as people who need help, not criminals,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krzysztof Borowski, a spokesperson for the EU border protection agency Frontex, said it was too early to discuss the incidents as a change in trend, pointing to the limited number of incidents over a short period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said Frontex was viewing the incident as an attempt by smugglers in Turkey to reactivate the Black Sea route. &quot;In the past it has been used. In 2014 we had 430 people arrive by the Black Sea to Romania and Bulgaria. In 2015 it was 68. In 2016 it was one. Perhaps there is a move to reactivate, for smugglers to put people through there and test it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Borowski, weather conditions on the Black Sea are often worse than in the Mediterranean, with stronger winds. &quot;Migrants are in bigger danger, especially if they take smaller vessels. It is a rough sea and a difficult one to cross,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabriela Leu, a spokesperson for UNHCR Romania, says that while it was difficult to draw a conclusion from a handful of incidents, &quot;what is clear is that when legal avenues are closed, people fleeing war and persecution take desperate measures to find safety&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that the agency was very concerned about all refugees and migrants who take to the sea in unseaworthy boats, and especially about people who entrust their safety to human smugglers. &quot;The likelihood of dying while trying to reach Europe along people-smuggling routes is alarmingly high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romanian authorities have so far taken into custody six individuals on suspicion of human trafficking related to the incidents, including two Turks, a Bulgarian, a Syrian, an Iraqi and a Cyprian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea routes are notoriously dangerous. Between January and July 2017, 2,224 migrants died trying to cross the Med, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Border police say no one has died trying to cross into Romania in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Migrant crisis triggers heightened risk of slavery in EU supply chains, say analysts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romania, which is outside the Schengen zone, has largely escaped the refugee crisis; few migrants have targeted Romania as an end destination and most have chosen more well-trodden routes to western Europe. However, the number of people trying to cross Romania's land borders illegally has also been on the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to data from the Romanian border police, in the first seven months of 2017, 2,800 people were caught trying to illegally cross Romania's borders, up from 1,624 in the whole of 2016. The majority, 1,370 people, were from Iraq, followed by 525 from Syria and 319 from Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions remain over Romania's preparedness to handle an influx of refugees. The country was one of the nations that initially resisted the setting up of an EU-wide quota in 2015 to redistribute refugees among member states. However, it later agreed to take in around 4,200 asylum seekers. As of the end of August, 727 people had been relocated to Romania, though there are suggestions that many are choosing not to stay in the country due to the limited opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't want to come to Romania to stay, they just want to get into the EU and then move on,&quot; said Razvan Samoila, executive director at Arca, an NGO in Bucharest that offers assistance to refugees and migrants. &quot;It is the same thing with the resettlement procedure,&quot; he said. &quot;Already, we've had four groups coming to Romania and none of them are now in Romania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samoila said these latest incidents on the Black Sea are test runs by smugglers, although he believes that the water and weather conditions are against them. &quot;The Mediterranean is not like the Black Sea. In the Black Sea, you don't know what will happen in 20 minutes' time,&quot; he said. &quot;These migrants who took this route on the Black Sea must have experienced a very hard journey.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Bangladeshi privately-owned, English-language newspaper The Daily Star on 29 November</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest agreement on repatriation of the Rohingyas may not be as effective as the two previous deals signed between Bangladesh and Myanmar in 1978 and 1992 respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A thorough examination of the latest deal signed between the two countries also signals Myanmar's reluctance to take back their nationals who have taken shelter in Bangladesh fleeing the military violence in their homeland.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal was signed on 23 November amid concerns by rights bodies over the absence of an atmosphere conducive to repatriation. Myanmar has tightened both the criteria for eligibility for the Rohingya's return and the verification process, making the prospect of repatriation this time almost impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in 1978 was not so harsh for the Rohingyas. They had citizenships in Myanmar. The then deal had made the criteria simple for their return. Presentation of national registration cards or any documents issued in Myanmar indicating their residence in Myanmar were enough for them to go back to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They even did not need to go through any verification process. The deal also stipulated a six month time frame for completion of the repatriation process. About 200,000 Rohingyas who took shelter in camps in Bangladesh fleeing violence in Myanmar were repatriated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingyas who had to cross the border again into Bangladesh in 1991-1992 fleeing fresh military violence in Myanmar, however, had to face difficulty to return to their homes due to introduction of the verification process in the 1992 deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingyas who lost their citizenships due to a draconian law in 1982 were required to submit documents like Myanmar citizenship identity cards or other documents to pass  scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee registration cards issued by Bangladesh government were, however, considered as documents in the verification process run by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, that set up a sub-office to process the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this process, around 200,000 Rohingya refugees were able to return. Yet, around 30,000 were left behind in Bangladesh as they were unable to present sufficient documentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Myanmar has tightened the noose this time. According to the new agreement, Myanmar authorities, not UNHCR, will conduct the verification process and the Rohingyas will have to submit documents like copies of expired citizenship identity cards or national registration cards or other relevant documents to prove their past residency in Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is something many Rohingyas will find hard to do as whatever   documents they had were either burned with their houses or destroyed in their flight through the monsoon rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike 1992, refugee registration cards issued by the Bangladesh government will not be considered this time for their repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, separated family members and orphans left behind will require to be certified by a Bangladesh court to be eligible for repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR will have a back seat in the process this time. Additionally, Myanmar authorities will also verify the refugee documents issued by UNHCR.  In the end it will be Myanmar's discretion whether to take assistance of UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal does not specify any timeframe for completion of the verification process. What Myanmar's Minister of Social Welfare and Resettlement, Win Myat Aye, said recently about the verification is more alarming. He said Myanmar government could verify 300 potential returnees a day. This means at that rate the process of verifying around 700,000 Rohingyas refugees since October last year will take years to complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are more things for the Rohingyas to be concerned about. After the repatriation in 1978 and 1992, the Rohingyas were able to return to their homes. But this time, many of them will not be able to go back as their houses were burned and razed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the new agreement, they will be settled in temporary places at Dar Gyi Zar village, about 20 kilometers from Maungdaw near the Bangladesh border. It is one of the areas hit hard by the violence that began on 25 August that developed into a full-blown refugee and humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the agreement, the Myanmar government, however, promised not to keep them at temporary holdings for long time. But the fate of more than one lakh Rohingya living in inhuman condition in the camps inside Myanmar after they were displaced in the violence of 2012 is testimony enough of the Myanmar government's hostile attitude towards the Rohingya. International human rights organisations and leaders labelled the camps as modern day Nazi concentration camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new agreement is only for the repatriation of those who entered Bangladesh after the violence in October last year and August this year. Rohingyas who crossed into Bangladesh earlier will be considered for repatriation after conclusion of the current agreement. This means they will have to wait for an indefinite period in the camps in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the above difficulties, Dhaka did not agree in early October to Myanmar's proposal of following the criteria of the 1992 deal to take back the Rohingyas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons were clear as explained by Foreign Minster AH Mahmood Ali in a diplomatic briefing on October 9: the 1992 criteria is not &quot;realistic&quot; and the &quot;situation of 1992 and current situation are entirely different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dhaka clarified its position a week after Myanmar Union Minister Kyaw Tint Swe during his visit to Dhaka proposed to follow the criteria of the 1992 deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one and a half months down the line, Mahmood Ali agreed with Myanmar's proposal and signed an agreement during his recent visit to Naypyidaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This development came within a week after the Chinese foreign minister's visit to Dhaka and Naypyidaw. China has been protecting Myanmar from the international community's pressure and action and it is also backing a bilateral resolution of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signing the agreement made China's efforts successful and made it easy for Myanmar to buy more time to breathe and to ease international pressure on it. But for the Rohingyas, the coming days may appear more uncertain and the burden on Bangladesh will grow heavier.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">894 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by leading English-language Pakistani daily Dawn website on 24 September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD: An observation mission that monitored the recently-held population and housing census has described the sharing of census data with a 'third-party institution' as &quot;a breach of confidentiality of the collected data&quot; according to census practices and procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission, deployed by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) at the request of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, also observed that &quot;the participation of the military in the census process is not at all a recommended international practice.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Pakistan, though, observers noted that it was essential for two reasons: to ensure the security and to avoid any mishandling of the data. However, &quot;data collection by the military... amounts to a parallel census and this is not internationally acceptable,&quot; the mission report says. Age records were mainly obtained from CNIC data and most often verified by the accompanying army officer through SMS to the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA). This, the report said, &quot;breached confidentiality&quot;.The UNFPA had developed the terms of reference of the mission and contracted national and international observers, in consultation with a sub-committee of the PBS governing council. The purpose of the mission was to ensure that the census conducted was in line with internationally-accepted practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army also administered a questionnaire, which had information on the total number of household members and the detailed nationality of the head of household. &quot;This is very unusual and questionable especially given the fact that the main questionnaire had no provision for detailed nationality,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also pointed out irregularities in the way enumerators and their army escorts collected information. For example, most observers noted that it was the civilian enumerator who provided the information about nationality to the army enumerator if the information was not seen on the identity card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from completing their own questionnaire, army enumerators were equipped with mobile phones through which they specifically verified the identity card numbers of respondents, either to be sure of their authenticity or to obtain information about the nationality and age of the identity card holders and other linked family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most cases, the report said, army enumerators completed their own questionnaires by looking at the questionnaire of the civilian enumerator. In some cases, where he was not able to do so, it was done later in the evening at the end of the day's work, by copying the information from the civilian questionnaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is of course very unusual for soldiers to not only collect information in a population census but also to embark upon verification of (the) respondent's demographic information. In doing this, collected census data was shared with two other parties (the army and Nadra), which might further compromise the data quality, and which constitutes a breach of census data secrecy,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The exclusion of the residents (refugees or non-refugees) living in refugee villages from the census also breached the principle of universality. These issues need to be addressed urgently by the concerned offices if the census is to be considered in line with national legislation and basic census principles including international standards,&quot; the mission report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says the army provided much-needed logistics for the census, but noted that soldiers were also playing the role of enumerators, collecting information about respondents through the civilian enumerator, but not directly speaking to the respondents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army officers that accompanied the enumerators were considered cooperative and rather open regarding their participation in the census exercise. They were very willing to share their own census forms and explained why they sent CNIC numbers to Nadra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers based in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa reported that they were not allowed to observe enumeration in refugee villages because no census was taking place there. According to their report, the district administrator of the area where refugee villages were located informed the team that no counting exercise would take place in any of the refugee villages because of a government directive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, if a refugee resided in the city, he/she would be counted or enumerated under the category &quot;other nationality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This posture is however surprising because according to the United Nation Revised Census Principles and Recommendations, &quot;population census is the total process of collecting, compiling, evaluating, analysing and publishing or otherwise disseminating demographic, economic and social data pertaining, at a specified time, to all persons in a country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monitors in all provinces also reported problems with the enumeration of transgender individuals, and persons with disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report recommended that enumerators should be better trained to interpret responses related to literacy. Many of them confused education with literacy, so that people who were literate but had not attended school were considered illiterate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all the provinces, observers reported that outdated maps constituted a major problem in the census.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report headlined &quot;Border tightened to stop Rohingya: Will deport those staying from beginning: home minister&quot; by privately-owned Nepalese newspaper Annapurna Post on 17 September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For fear that the Muslim Rohingya could enter Nepal through Bangladesh and India the government has taken precautions along the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathmandu - The Nepal Government is tightening its border with India to stop Muslim Rohingya from entering into Nepal. Following consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Home Affairs has stepped up security precautions on the suspicion of Rohingya getting into the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar security forces on 25 August attacked the minority Muslim Rohingya community in the state of Rakhine, triggering violence. The military regime in Myanmar considers Rohingya not as Myanmar nationals but Rohingya have been claiming that they have been living in Rakhine state for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ethnic violence between the state and Rohingyas has left more than 1,000 Mulsims dead in the three weeks of violence, according to international media reports. The number of Rohingya, who have entered the bordering Bangladesh since the outbreak of violence, has crossed 400,000, according to the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of Rohingya seeking refuge in India is 40,000 at present. A few days ago India said it would deport Rohingya. The Nepal Government, which also hosts Rohingya, has not yet taken a formal decision on whether to deport them or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For fear that the Muslim Rohingya could enter Nepal through Bangladesh and India the government has taken precautions along the border. &quot;As soon as the issue of Rohingya Muslims began to expand, to prevent their possible entry into Nepal we have instructed security agencies and administration to take precautionary measures along the border,&quot; Ministry of Home Affairs Spokesman Ram Krishna Subedi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subedi said as of now no Rohingya had entered Nepal through Bangladesh and India. &quot;All Rohingya in Kathmandu at present had arrived before 2012. There is no new arrival of Rohingya,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a function in the Nepalese capital on Saturday [16 September], Home Minister Janardan Sharma said the Nepal Government was informed on the Muslim Rohingya community that had taken refuge in Nepal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Home Administration is fully aware on this. We have also information that they have taken private land and constructed houses,&quot; he said. Necessary instructions had also been issued to relevant agencies to study these matters, he said. &quot;We would not allow any more Rohingya to come from Myanmar to Nepal, even those that are there will be deported,&quot; Sharma said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Secretary Shankar Das Bairagi said Rohingya were in Nepal and discussions had continued with the Ministry of Home Affairs on the prospects of more arrivals. &quot;The Ministry of Home Affairs says the border would be tightened,&quot; he said. Following fresh outbreak of violence in 2012, Muslim Rohingya had entered into Nepal through Bangladesh and India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking advantage of the open border between Nepal and India, they were successful to enter into Nepal. There are 147 Rohingya taking refuge in Kathmandu, according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees. In addition, hundred more have applied for the refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 312 Rohingya refugees are living in makeshift camps in the Baluwakhani area in Kapan in Kathmandu. Some of them are looking for jobs while others are working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nepal is not a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention but on humanitarian grounds Nepal has been providing refuge to Bhutanese and Tibetan refugees. They have been treated as illegal immigrants. The United States and European Union have repeatedly requested Nepal to sign the convention as well as its protocol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been growing voices that it was time Nepal should formulate a concrete policy on refugees but the government has been deferring the matter. During the term of Baburam Bhattarai government, then Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha began a debate on a concrete refugee policy at the government level but the government was able to take no decision at all on the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's immigration system is broken. If you want to know just how badly, here's a question for you. Until recently, how do you think the Home Office worked out the number of people who came to the UK from outside the European Union?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might reasonably assume that this important calculation was done digitally - perhaps by cross-checking airline databases, or by crunching the data collected by the computer terminals when your passport gets checked. Unfortunately, you'd be wrong.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the immigration system is so antiquated, piles of visa entry forms - the slip of paper you fill in when you arrive in the UK - were collected in boxes. These were then sent off to be weighed, in an attempt to estimate how many people were coming through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine that. In the 21st century, at a time when technology is more affordable and powerful than ever, the most important statistic in the entire immigration system was calculated using an old-fashioned weighing scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what about working out how many non-EU nationals were leaving the UK each year? Well, that was beyond the abilities of the immigration authorities - maybe there were no piles of paper to weigh - so that statistic wasn't even collected at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be funny if it wasn't so serious. The Prime Minister's controversial clampdown on the number of skilled migrants coming to the UK is entirely informed by Home Office statistics - numbers that have been shown to be wildly unreliable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take foreign students. The Home Office has been steadily making it harder for foreign people to study in the UK - all because it estimated that 100,000 students were overstaying their visa every year. Last week the Office for National Statistics revealed the real number: 4,600. That means the Home Office's calculation was totally inaccurate - the true figure is 20 times lower than the one they were using to make immigration policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migration figures show students leave UK after studies finish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Lib-Dem leader Vince Cable puts it: &quot;We spent five years trying to persuade the Home Office that the figures they were using were bogus, but they persisted nonetheless on the basis of these phoney numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic cost of this policy error has been dramatic. The clampdown on foreign students means that our share of the international market for higher education is actually declining - and the number of Indian students who came to the UK, for example, fell every year that Theresa May was Home Secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in stark contrast to Australia, Canada and the US, where students are classed as temporary migrants and are excluded from immigration targets. So while the UK is busy making it harder for foreign students to come here, those other countries are pulling out all the stops to attract more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just foreign students who are being locked out by the immigration system - skilled migrants are being turned away too, with the Prime Minister rejecting an Australian-style points system and instead proposing to cut net migration from the current level of 273,000 a year to &quot;tens of thousands&quot;. As business leaders have pointed out, this arbitrary cap will negatively affect every industry in the UK, with dire consequences for the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the words of Theresa May's chief of staff Gavin Barwell, fewer skilled migrants &quot;means lower growth, fewer jobs and a heavier burden on British nationals struggling to pay down the deficit built up by the last government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's right. Hopefully the next Prime Minister will be able to get our immigration system back on track. We can't afford to keep heading in the wrong direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A job is the greatest gift for a refugee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week we hosted a dinner at my business, Second Home, with Help Refugees, an organisation set up by young Londoners determined to make a difference. (You might have seen the Help Refugees &quot;Choose Love&quot; T-shirts being worn by Lily Cole,Benedict Cumberbatch and other celebs.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a lovely evening - refugees ate with us for free, while the food was prepared by a brilliant London start-up called Welcome Kitchen, run by refugee women who celebrate their cultures by cooking delicious dishes from across the Middle East and Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome Kitchen is just one of many refugee businesses popping up across London right now - another of my favourites is Bread &amp; Roses, a social enterprise that trains and employs refugees to create beautiful bouquets of flowers that can be bought online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if you ever need catering or flowers, be sure to think of these refugee start-ups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the ancient Jewish philosopher Maimonides wrote, the highest form of charity is to create a job. That's the kind of charity we can all help with.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMENT; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">777 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's immigration system is broken. If you want to know just how badly, here's a question for you. Until recently, how do you think the Home Office worked out the number of people who came to the UK from outside the European Union?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might reasonably assume that this important calculation was done digitally - perhaps by cross-checking airline databases, or by crunching the data collected by the computer terminals when your passport gets checked. Unfortunately, you'd be wrong.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the immigration system is so antiquated, piles of visa entry forms - the slip of paper you fill in when you arrive in the UK - were collected in boxes. These were then sent off to be weighed, in an attempt to estimate how many people were coming through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine that. In the 21st century, at a time when technology is more affordable and powerful than ever, the most important statistic in the entire immigration system was calculated using an old-fashioned weighing scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what about working out how many non-EU nationals were leaving the UK each year? Well, that was beyond the abilities of the immigration authorities - maybe there were no piles of paper to weigh - so that statistic wasn't even collected at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be funny if it wasn't so serious. The Prime Minister's controversial clampdown on the number of skilled migrants coming to the UK is entirely informed by Home Office statistics - numbers that have been shown to be wildly unreliable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take foreign students. The Home Office has been steadily making it harder for foreign people to study in the UK - all because it estimated that 100,000 students were overstaying their visa every year. Last week the Office for National Statistics revealed the real number: 4,600. That means the Home Office's calculation was totally inaccurate - the true figure is 20 times lower than the one they were using to make immigration policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migration figures show students leave UK after studies finish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Lib-Dem leader Vince Cable puts it: &quot;We spent five years trying to persuade the Home Office that the figures they were using were bogus, but they persisted nonetheless on the basis of these phoney numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic cost of this policy error has been dramatic. The clampdown on foreign students means that our share of the international market for higher education is actually declining - and the number of Indian students who came to the UK, for example, fell every year that Theresa May was Home Secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in stark contrast to Australia, Canada and the US, where students are classed as temporary migrants and are excluded from immigration targets. So while the UK is busy making it harder for foreign students to come here, those other countries are pulling out all the stops to attract more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just foreign students who are being locked out by the immigration system - skilled migrants are being turned away too, with the Prime Minister rejecting an Australian-style points system and instead proposing to cut net migration from the current level of 273,000 a year to &quot;tens of thousands&quot;. As business leaders have pointed out, this arbitrary cap will negatively affect every industry in the UK, with dire consequences for the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the words of Theresa May's chief of staff Gavin Barwell, fewer skilled migrants &quot;means lower growth, fewer jobs and a heavier burden on British nationals struggling to pay down the deficit built up by the last government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's right. Hopefully the next Prime Minister will be able to get our immigration system back on track. We can't afford to keep heading in the wrong direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A job is the greatest gift for a refugee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week we hosted a dinner at my business, Second Home, with Help Refugees, an organisation set up by young Londoners determined to make a difference. (You might have seen the Help Refugees &quot;Choose Love&quot; T-shirts being worn by Lily Cole,Benedict Cumberbatch and other celebs.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a lovely evening - refugees ate with us for free, while the food was prepared by a brilliant London start-up called Welcome Kitchen, run by refugee women who celebrate their cultures by cooking delicious dishes from across the Middle East and Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome Kitchen is just one of many refugee businesses popping up across London right now - another of my favourites is Bread &amp; Roses, a social enterprise that trains and employs refugees to create beautiful bouquets of flowers that can be bought online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if you ever need catering or flowers, be sure to think of these refugee start-ups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the ancient Jewish philosopher Maimonides wrote, the highest form of charity is to create a job. That's the kind of charity we can all help with.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMENT; Version:2</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">633 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horrific stories of children burned alive, women raped and men beheaded are emerging from the Rohingya Muslims crammed into the refugee camps of southern Bangladesh. They are among the 620,000 victims of Burma's brutal ethnic cleansing campaign and their plight demands the urgent attention of the country's neighbours, the wider international community and everyone with a shred of humanity. The unfolding tragedy shames us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the murders and mass expulsion are described in this newspaper today. At first victims died at the hands of machete gangs on motorbikes. Soon it became clear, as whole villages were set ablaze, that the Burmese military was running a vicious campaign in Rakhine state. Trapped on the Burmese side of the border with Bangladesh, desperate mothers tried to escape by improvising a raft made up of plastic bottles and bamboo. Children were swept into the rivers.The Times Christmas Appeal is backing an experienced charity, Children on the Edge, which already has a strong network on the ground in Bangladesh. Set up by the late Dame Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop, it has been working with the Rohingya Muslims for seven years. Successive Burmese governments have refused to accept the existence of the Rohingya as an ethnic group, claiming they were illegal migrants from Bangladesh. In fact, the overwhelming majority of Muslims living in Rakhine state were born in Burma and are denied citizenship.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children on the Edge has correctly identified the young as the most vulnerable in this exodus. It has in the past set up classrooms for refugee children in the Kutupalong camp in Bangladesh. Now it must scale up its activities. The breakneck pace of the expulsions, worse than anything since the Rwanda genocide, has left the usual aid infrastructure reeling. John Littleton, who works for the charity, has seen nothing to compare with this emergency in terms of &quot;the scale and the overwhelming sheer amount of human need&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The priorities are clear and urgent: to provide food, rehydration tablets, clean water in the camps, solar lighting and proper sanitation. The charity is mobilising partners in the field to expand all these basic services. The Kutupalong camp population is home to 325,000, a number likely to rise to 400,000. It is easy for children to get lost in this heaving multitude, so Children on the Edge intends to set up 100 learning centres, educating 10,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This and other aid efforts depend on the continuing goodwill of Bangladesh. Governments across the world should be helping what is already one of the world's poorest nations to support the Rohingya. Few of the refugees are ready to return. There is no guarantee of their safety, no homes to return to, no rights of citizenship and every likelihood that the whole miserable cycle of murder, rape and expulsion will begin again as soon as they are out of the international spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many, including Pope Francis, have urged Burma to change its ways. Those responsible for atrocities should be identified and sanctioned, especially senior military commanders. This is unlikely, however, to change the attitudes of generals who have ruled the country for so long in conditions of almost complete isolation. Pressure has to come above all from China, Burma's chief trading partner. If the misery of the Rohingya Muslims stokes the anger of a future generation of jihadists, China and other Asian neighbours will sooner or later be the targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the time being the goal must be to protect and educate those in the camps, and to conjure out of their dismal situation a glimmer of hope. Children on the Edge understands the scope of the problem. It is a deserving charity on the front line of tragedy.You can donate online at thetimes.co.uk/timesappeal or call 0151 284 2336</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan holds 80,000 people, making it bigger than some British cities but without their urban infrastructure or even the simplest technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life is hard for the Syrian people displaced here in the desert. My eyes were first opened to the complexity of refugee life in July 2016, when I was invited to visit Zaatari by the UNHCR. Now I'm part of an international team of experts - varying from engineers to fashion designers - trying to come up with practical solutions to help the people of Zaatari fend for themselves despite the restrictions placed on them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitations improve creativity and we think up solutions we would never have thought of in a lab: we've made windmills, wheelchairs and recycling trucks out of old bikes, even grown tomatoes without soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as homeless engineers, teachers and doctors, Zaatari is full of farmers; the majority of refugees here come from the Dara'a region of their homeland, known for its fertile soil. Yet under Jordanian law they can't plant anything in the ground here in the camp. Their legal status as refugees means they can't do anything that looks like it might lead to permanence. And water is very limited here and the soil is very salty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in the UK I had a couple of horticulture projects on the go using hydroponics - a way of growing plants without soil, using just a nutrient solution, keeping the roots supported in an inert medium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had been using specialised polyurethane foam as synthetic soil for plants, with the added benefit that it has lower water requirements, so I adopted the science of this technique to use foam mattresses from the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tubs into pots and the polyurethane foam as the substitute soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We introduced the principles of hydroponics at a workshop with Zaatari residents (who, in many cases, knew more than us) and attendees quickly set up a production line - cutting raw materials, making up nutrient solutions, planting seedlings and cuttings in the pots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team of seven scientists and engineers also went to Zaatari for a week of &quot;scrapyard challenges&quot; to come up with solutions for water heating and electricity generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Fairclough, a professor in mechanical engineering, led a project aiming to produce energy from windmills; he is familiar with running pumps and generators from windmills thanks to his childhood in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are plenty of materials to hand: sheet steel and angle bar, wood, canvas and poles from tents, even a stock of recovered bicycles donated by the Amsterdam Police. After building prototypes, we are now looking at how to deploy our windmill design.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I learned the expression &quot;necessity is the mother of invention&quot; as a child and here I have seen it play out in front of me. The refugees' eagerness to put a plan into action has been astounding. It is incredible to see their resilience.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United States of America -- Children account for over half of the 12 million West and Central African people on the move each year, with some 75 per cent of them remaining in sub-Saharan Africa, and less than one in five heading to Europe -- UNICEF announced today as part of a new report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Search of Opportunities: Voices of children on the move in West and Central Africa looks at the main drivers behind regional child migration and displacement, as well as longer-term implications for the region if these large scale population movements intensify as projected with current trends in population growth.<BR><BR>&quot;Children in West and Central Africa are moving in greater numbers than ever before, many in search of safety or a better life,&quot; said UNICEF Regional Director Marie-Pierre Poirier. &quot;Yet the majority of these children are moving within Africa, not to Europe or elsewhere. We must broaden the discussion on migration to encompass the vulnerabilities of all children on the move and expand systems to protect them, in all their intended destinations.&quot;<BR><BR>The report, which is based on a series of interviews with migrants and their families from several countries, reveals a complex set of drivers for migration beyond poverty. It suggests that migration involving children and young people from West and Central Africa is likely to increase due to a confluence of factors including rapid population growth and urbanization, unequitable economic development, persistent conflict, weak governance and limited institutional capacity to support the most vulnerable populations.<BR><BR>Climate change is also a major factor driving migration in West and Central Africa. The region is projected to experience a three to four degree rise in temperature this century -- more than one and a half times higher than anywhere else in the world. Severe flooding and drought is already causing the loss of livelihoods and displacement, while changing climate patterns are making some forms of agriculture increasingly unsustainable. Tensions over access to scarce resources for cattle and livestock are leading to hostilities in some rural areas, pushing greater numbers of people towards cities.<BR><BR>The report finds that the region lacks sufficient protection systems -- both within and across borders - to ensure the safety and wellbeing of refugee and migrant children, a gap which will become more pronounced with the projected increase in both national populations and migration. The report recommends that policy makers put children at the centre of any response to migration. This can be done by strengthening the chain of protection for children between countries of origin, transit and destination. The close cooperation of governments, UN, and non-governmental partners is critical in to ensure children's access to healthcare, education and other essential services, regardless of their migration status.<BR><BR>UNICEF continues to urge all governments, in West and Central Africa, in Europe and elsewhere to adopt the six-point Agenda for Action for the protection of refugee and migrant children:<BR><BR>1. Protect child refugees and migrants, particularly unaccompanied children, from exploitation and violence;<BR><BR>2. End the detention of children seeking refugee status or migrating, by introducing a range of practical alternatives;<BR><BR>3.

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All remaining refugees and asylum seekers at the Manus Island detention facility have been moved out.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration Minister Peter Dutton on Friday confirmed all those who had refused to leave the centre are now in alternative accommodation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Australian government welcomes this development,' he said in a statement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papua New Guinea police and immigration officers bearing metal batons entered the centre on Friday morning to complete the task of clearing it, three weeks after the facility was officially closed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video footage shows local police hitting and threatening refugees, and photographs appeared to confirm injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, PNG police said no one was forced or handcuffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre, set up by Australia to process asylum seeker boat arrivals, was officially closed on October 31. However, the men refused to leave, saying the new facilities were unsafe and lacked proper health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN High Commission for Refugees received reports of force being used.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Dutton accused advocates in Australia of making inaccurate and exaggerated claims of violence and injuries on Manus.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What is clear is that there has been an organised attempt to provoke trouble and disrupt the new facilities,' he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government has been told that some equipment at the alternative accommodation centres has been 'sabotaged' - including backup generators and water infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The equipment is being repaired or replaced and the government understands these matters are under investigation,' Mr Dutton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Advocates should now desist from holding out false hope to these men that they will ever be brought to Australia.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, pictures emerged of the brand new accommodation arranged for 600 asylum seekers formerly detained on Manus Island.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papua New Guinea police and army stormed the detention centre on Thursday to evict 400 male asylum seekers who refused to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immigration &nbsp;Minister Peter Dutton slammed the holdouts, calling their behaviour outrageous.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think it's outrageous that people are still there and they have trashed the facility, they're living in squalor,' he told 2GB radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Australian taxpayers have paid about $10 million for a new facility and we want people to move.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Dutton again reiterated the men will never be coming to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's like the tenant that won't move out of the house when you build a new house for them to move into,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brand new sleeping, cooking and dining facilities are shown in the photos of the&nbsp;East Lorengau Transit Refugee Centre, the West Lorengau Haus and Hillside Haus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facilities shown in the photos are a far cry from the destroyed Manus Island centre where the detainees had been housed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buildings two storeys high can be seen in one of the photographs, surrounded by well-landscaped grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New air-conditioning units are installed outside the barred windows of the detention centre dormitories, painted navy and cream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sleeping quarters contain two single beds each, with a shared dressing table and a large window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large dining facilities and an open cafeteria-style kitchen are shown in another photograph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a picture appearing to show kitchen facilities containing a stove, a fridge, sinks and counter space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A laundry room is pictured, with washing machines, a hot water heater and large stainless steel sinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photographs stand in stark contrast to others taken after the last asylum seekers were removed from the Manus Island facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trashed rooms, rubbish strewn everywhere and crumbling infrastructure can be seen in photographs taken during Thursday's police operation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     WHAT ARE THE KEY DATES IN MANUS ISLAND HISTORY? &nbsp;                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has come under sharp criticism from the United Nations and human rights groups for its policy of holding asylum-seekers in offshore detention camps in the Pacific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was forced to close one camp, on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, on October 31, but hundreds of refugees have refused to leave it for new, PNG-run transit centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a timeline of key dates in the history of the Manus camp leading up to PNG police beginning to forcibly remove refugees from the centre on Thursday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- In 2001, the conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard opens the Manus camp as part of a strict policy of 'offshore detention' of asylum-seekers caught trying to get to Australia by boat. The government defends the policy as needed to halt drownings of boatpeople.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- In 2008, Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd closes the camp to fulfil an election pledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- In November 2012, Rudd's Labor successor Julia Gillard reopens the detention centre under public pressure following a sharp increase in the number of boatpeople trying to reach Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- In July 2013, after returning to office, Rudd significantly toughens the refugee policy by announcing that anyone who seeks asylum by boat will never be settled in Australia, with all sent to Manus or a second centre in the Pacific nation of Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- In February 2014, a riot by Manus detainees leaves around 70 men injured, including by gunshots fired by police. One refugee, Iranian Reza Barati, was beaten to death by PNG camp staff during the unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- In September 2014, another Iranian refugee, Hamid Kehazaei, dies after delayed treatment for a bacterial infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- In January 2015, more than 500 men hold a two-week hunger strike to protest conditions in the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On April 26, 2016, the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court rules the detention centre violates constitutional guarantees of liberty and must be closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On August 17, 2016, Australia announces the Manus camp will be closed, but insists the detainees must be moved to other island camps or be resettled in third countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On June 14, 2017, Australia agrees to pay compensation of Aus$70 million (US$53 million) to asylum-seekers detained on Manus Island between 2012 and 2016, avoiding a court case that alleged it breached a duty of care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On August 7, 2017, Iranian detainee Hamed Shamshiripour is found dead, apparently after committing suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On September 26, 2017, a first group of 24 men leave Manus for the United States under a resettlement deal reached with the administration of former President Barack Obama but sharply criticised by his successor Donal Trump. The total number to be transferred under the initial deal is still uncertain, with the US under no obligation to take a set number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On October 11, 2017, Australia offers to move Manus detainees to family camps on Nauru. Few accept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On October 31, 2017, Australia declares the Manus camp closed and halts electricity, water and food supplies to the remaining 600 detainees who refuse to leave, fearing for their safety in the PNG-run transit camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On November 2, 2017, the UNHCR calls on Australia to stop what it describes as a 'humanitarian emergency' in the Manus camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On November 5, 2017, new Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern renews a New Zealand offer to resettle 150 of the men from Manus, but her Australian counterpart, Malcolm Turnbull, brushes aside the offer, saying US resettlement remains the priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On November 7, 2017, A PNG court rejects a detainee appeal to restore water, electricity and food supplies to Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On November 9, 2017, PNG authorities threaten to use force and police in following days begin entering the camp to destroy shelters and water containers in bid to force departures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several dozen detainees move voluntarily to the transit centres, but reports begin emerging that they are not completed, with inadequate water and electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On November 23, 2017, PNG police raid the camp, destroying belongings and forcing around 40 refugees onto buses bound for the transit centres.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report headlined &quot;Nepal's constitution exemplary in world: Deuba&quot; by privately-owned Nepalese newspaper Kantipur on 24 September; subheadings as published</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has said that Nepal's peace process, successful landing of the armed conflict, and the Constitution promulgated through the Constituent Assembly remain exemplary in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said despite numerous challenges Nepal concluded the armed conflict through negotiations, which remains inspiring for the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a matter which he had been raising in various international forums, he told a reception held by the Permanent Mission of Nepal to the United Nations to celebrate the second anniversary of the promulgation of the Constitution here on Friday [22 September].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The right of the people provided in a democracy cannot be taken away by anyone. The world is witness to Nepal's achievements,&quot; he said. Deuba also officially urged the international community for Nepal's candidature to the United Nations Human Rights Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Nepal's Constitution was one of the best in the world in terms of the fundamental rights of the people and inclusion. &quot;Several of the rights provided by the people in the Constitution have not been provided by many countries in the world to their people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another beauty of Nepal's Constitution was its best arrangement for the checks and balances between the three arms of the government. An independent judiciary was the pillar of Nepal's democracy, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An important aspect of the implementation of the Constitution was the peaceful and successful holding of local elections, Deuba said, and expressed the confidence that the provincial and federal elections will also be held with the maximum participation of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Within the next three months both the elections will be completed for the country to move forward to political stability,&quot; he said. He said Nepal was moving forward solving all problems on its own way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Request to take back remaining Bhutanese refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Deuba has requested his Bhutanese counterpart Tshering Tobgay to take back the remaining Bhutanese refugees. During the meeting at the UN Headquarters, Deuba requested him to take back the remaining Bhutanese refugees as others were resettled in third countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobgay responded by saying that his government was prepared to solve the problem of refugees through talks. The mutual interest and relations between the two countries were also discussed during the meeting, Prime Minister's Foreign Affairs Adviser Dr. Dinesh Bhattarai said. He did not categorically mention the Bhutanese refugees but said all pending matters were discussed. Prime Minister Deuba also urged Tobgay to support Nepal in the UN Human Rights Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister's instructions to ambassadors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Deuba instructed Nepal's Ambassadors in the United States and neighbouring countries to be &quot;proactive for visible works.&quot; He asked the kind of works Nepal's Embassies in Brazil and Canada were doing and asked questions on their progress reports and prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ambassadors raised the matter on lack of personnel, the Prime Minister instructed them to work for the interest of the country and the people within the available personnel and resources. He said, &quot;Work in the interest of the country and the people, explore possibilities. Do not relax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister for Foreign Affairs Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Adviser Bhattarai, Ambasaador Arjun Karki, Ambassador to Brazil Tara Prasad Pokhrel, Nepal Permanent Representative to UN Durga Prasad Bhattarai, Ambassador to Canada Kali Pokharel, and Consul General in New York Madhu Kumar Marasini participated in the meeting. The Consul General attended the meeting at the level of Ambassador.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">742 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeing the world from the perspective of her mother and grandparents instilled in Tanya Ward a strong sense of social justice from a very young age. &quot;My mum was a lone parent and was the first of her generation to keep her baby. That meant we lived with my grandparents for 10 years before she married my stepdad. I saw the struggles she went through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other thing that was very impactful was that my grandparents were deaf. I saw the world through their eyes and their experiences.&quot; And some of those experiences made Ward really think about discrimination and equality issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that her father was Lebanese was also important in shaping her geographical imagination and how she thought about the wider world. &quot;He had no role in my upbringing but it did make me much more attuned to the situation of refugees and migrants and people of difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would say they were the big influences on me and why I was very motivated around social change and trying to make a difference for other people around me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, Ward joined the Children's Rights Alliance as chief executive, having previously worked for the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Refugee Council, the Centre for Migration Studies and City of Dublin VEC, where she had carried out research on the education needs of refugees and refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children's referendum was a key attraction of the Children's Rights Alliance job. &quot;There are few opportunities in your life when you get to try to shape what's happening in the country, and it will have an amazing impact for children and young people for years to come,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the fact that the Children's Rights Alliance has over 100 member organisations - including children's charities, housing agencies, education unions and various interest groups - also appealed to her. &quot;What's really exciting about that is we have the opportunity to work with groups and sectors of society across the board on different campaigns for children and young people. That makes the job different every day and makes us much more impactful because we can work through these sector-leading organisations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as the referendum, the Children's Rights Alliance played a key role in influencing the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. &quot;I happened to come into the Children's Right Alliance at a time when lots of big reforms were planned and we had a chance to shape them,&quot; says Ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other important priorities for Ward have been around child poverty and the rights and protection of refugee children in direct provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the recent gains have included lone parents being able to earn more before losing their benefits, an expansion of the school meals programme and an increase in the back to school allowance, as well as an increase in the direct provision payment for children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Changes have happened through being really focused and working with the members, and then very closely with government, trying to find out what the obstacles are and what we can do to overcome them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as being very focused on specific issues, building up ongoing relationships with decision makers is central to Ward's approach. &quot;You have to recognise when they do something positive for children and young people. We always try to give credit where credit is due.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we do have serious issues, I go directly to the people responsible and say 'this is what we're discovering, what can you do about it?' If they can't address it, we go onto the airwaves, let the public know and put the public pressure on. These different things have worked for us over the years and it's why we've been successful in getting key changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals also have an important role to play in influencing the political and social agenda, she says. &quot;It was really fantastic in the last general election that members of the public were telling politicians on the doorstep that they were very worried about the housing crisis and the homeless crisis. And that had a direct effect on the decisions ministers made when they went into government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to get active. You have to be passionate about your issue. And you have to look at what your channel of influence is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN BRIEF: TANYA WARD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanya Ward, 42, has been chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance - a membership group of over 100 organisations working towards improving the lives of children - since 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have to get active. And you have to look at what your channel of influence is</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeing the world from the perspective of her mother and grandparents instilled in Tanya Ward a strong sense of social justice from a very young age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mum was a lone parent and was the first of her generation to keep her baby. That meant we lived with my grandparents for 10 years before she married my stepdad. I saw the struggles she went through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other thing that was very impactful was that my grandparents were deaf. I saw the world through their eyes and their experiences.&quot; And some of those experiences made Ward really think about discrimination and equality issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that her father was Lebanese was also important in shaping her geographical imagination and how she thought about the wider world. &quot;He had no role in my upbringing but it did make me much more attuned to the situation of refugees and migrants and people of difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would say they were the big influences on me and why I was very motivated around social change and trying to make a difference for other people around me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, Ward joined the Children's Rights Alliance as chief executive, having previously worked for the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Refugee Council, the Centre for Migration Studies and City of Dublin VEC, where she had carried out research on the education needs of refugees and refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children's referendum was a key attraction of the Children's Rights Alliance job. &quot;There are few opportunities in your life when you get to try to shape what's happening in the country, and it will have an amazing impact for children and young people for years to come,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the fact that the Children's Rights Alliance has over 100 member organisations - including children's charities, housing agencies, education unions and various interest groups - also appealed to her. &quot;What's really exciting about that is we have the opportunity to work with groups and sectors of society across the board on different campaigns for children and young people. That makes the job different every day and makes us much more impactful because we can work through these sector-leading organisations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as the referendum, the Children's Rights Alliance played a key role in influencing the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. &quot;I happened to come into the Children's Right Alliance at a time when lots of big reforms were planned and we had a chance to shape them,&quot; says Ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other important priorities for Ward have been around child poverty and the rights and protection of refugee children in direct provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the recent gains have included lone parents being able to earn more before losing their benefits, an expansion of the school meals programme and an increase in the back to school allowance, as well as an increase in the direct provision payment for children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Changes have happened through being really focused and working with the members, and then very closely with government, trying to find out what the obstacles are and what we can do to overcome them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as being very focused on specific issues, building up ongoing relationships with decision makers is central to Ward's approach. &quot;You have to recognise when they do something positive for children and young people. We always try to give credit where credit is due.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we do have serious issues, I go directly to the people responsible and say 'this is what we're discovering, what can you do about it?' If they can't address it, we go onto the airwaves, let the public know and put the public pressure on. These different things have worked for us over the years and it's why we've been successful in getting key changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals also have an important role to play in influencing the political and social agenda, she says. &quot;It was really fantastic in the last general election that members of the public were telling politicians on the doorstep that they were very worried about the housing crisis and the homeless crisis. And that had a direct effect on the decisions ministers made when they went into government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to get active. You have to be passionate about your issue. And you have to look at what your channel of influence is.&quot;In brief: Tanya Ward Tanya Ward (42) has been chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance - a membership group of over 100 organisations working towards improving the lives of children - since 2012.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are all shocked by the dramatic escalation of sectarian tensions in Myanmar's Rakhine state,&quot; Mr. Guterres remarked today in his address to the opening of the General Assembly's high-level debate. &quot;A vicious cycle of persecution, discrimination, radicalization and violent repression has led more than 400,000 desperate people to flee, putting regional stability at risk.&quot;<BR><BR>He stressed that the authorities in Myanmar must end the military operations, allow unhindered humanitarian access and recognize the right of refugees to return in safety and dignity. They must also address the grievances of the Rohingya, whose status has been left unresolved for far too long, he added.<BR><BR>Marzuki Darusman, the Chairperson of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva that it is clear that there is &quot;a grave humanitarian crisis&quot; underway that requires urgent attention.<BR><BR>In addition to the over 400,000 people who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since 25 August, Mr. Darusman noted that there are reports that nearly 200 Rohingya villages in the affected area have been emptied.<BR><BR>&quot;It is important for us to see with our own eyes the sites of these alleged violations and abuses and to speak directly with the affected people and with the authorities,&quot; he stated, noting that the Commission has requested the Government of Myanmar for unfettered access to the country. UN aid agencies scaling up assistance<BR><BR>As the number of those crossing the border into Bangladesh increases, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is ramping up its operations, including moving new arrivals into family tents and temporary communal shelters at a new extension site next to the Kutupalong camp near Cox's Bazar.<BR><BR>Spokesperson Duniya Aslam Khan told a news conference in Geneva that refugees have told UNHCR staff that they suffered from cold and rain during their treks from Myanmar.<BR><BR>&quot;Many had fallen ill, particularly small children. There is urgent need for more latrines, not least to reduce risks of a spread of disease with so many people living in close quarters. Many also complained of hunger and said they had eaten little on their journeys, which took up to 10 days on foot,&quot; she stated.<BR><BR>With an estimated 415,000 refugees having arrived since late August the humanitarian challenges have become immense, according to UNHCR, which noted the &quot;remarkable generosity&quot; by many individual Bangladeshis, with people trucking food and clothes to the refugees in the camps and others camping along the single main road.<BR><BR>However, the Government needs more support, and UNHCR will be issuing an appeal this week for the emergency humanitarian response in Bangladesh till the end of year.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) is providing critical support to step-up health services delivery in Cox's Bazar.<BR><BR>&quot;Vulnerable populations require access to health services, including emergency and basic health care. Access for women to reproductive health services is especially important,&quot; noted Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director for WHO South-East Asia.<BR><BR>The agency added in a news release that poor nutrition, communicable diseases (including vaccine-preventable and water-borne diseases), injuries and other concerns such as mental health provide immense public health challenges that the Bangladeshi Ministry of Health, WHO and other health partners are working to address.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK will be expected to hand asylum to potentially thousands of refugees to ease the 'unprecedented' migration  crisis in Italy, Brussels chiefs said yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a fierce diplomatic row broke out between European countries over how to deal with the situation, the EU  said Britain was expected to open its doors to help the bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement came as Austria prepared to deploy troops in a bid to block migrants trying to cross its border with Italy and EU officials warned that the crisis could last for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday it emerged that the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe this year has passed 100,000 and nearly 2,250 have died making the journey. Italy has taken in nearly 85 per cent of the arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calls for the UK to accept refugees will raise questions about whether Theresa May is willing to depart from her hard-line approach on immigration amid pressure from fellow EU leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the voluntary scheme, the Prime Minister will be asked to give refuge to an unspecified number of refugees fleeing war-torn African countries such as Libya, Sudan, Niger and Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain has previously distanced itself from immigration rules set by Brussels and instead focussed on its own schemes, such as David Cameron's 2015 pledge for Britain to take 20,000 Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the European Commission's deputy head Frans Timmermans yesterday said that Theresa May would be pushed to take part in the new programme due to the strain on Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing towards his hope of British support, the Brussels boss said the scheme would 'meet the requirements which the British government in the past have always set'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's an exercise we need to do at the European level and we count on solidarity from all member states including the United Kingdom,' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Home Secretary Mrs May is understood to have resisted calls to widen her predecessor's offer of asylum to Syrians and has lobbied for toughening the definition of who is deemed a refugee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's EU proposal was amongst a range of measures announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as bolstering the ability of the Libyan coastguard to prevent packed dinghies from leaving, Mr Timmermans said the EU needed significantly stronger powers to deport those denied asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: 'We know that many of the people arriving in Italy, when scrutinised, do not have the right to international protection because they don't flee from war of persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They seek a better life, which is a noble pursuit, but it does not grant them the right to stay in the European Union.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutch official said deportation rules made the process 'excruciatingly difficult' and said people were abusing rights offered to refugees under the Geneva Convention for 'economic reasons'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing to further problems ahead, he said: 'I will tell you this this migration issue will not go away, not today, not tomorrow, not next year, not for a decade, not for two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is a global phenomenon that will be with us for generations.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervention, which also included more financial support to Italy, followed days of concern and threats from officials in Rome to block charity boats carrying rescued migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid fears that requests for EU countries to provide more assistance to Italy could lead to clashes, a diplomatic row already broke out with Austria yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austrian foreign minister Sebastian Kurz said his country was ready to 'protect our border if necesssary' by sending up to 750 troops to the border with Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said that four armoured vehicles had already been sent close to Brenner Pass, the Alps route that forms the border between the countries, should migrants try to flee from Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austria also promised to increase border controls to 'avoid a situation comparable to summer 2015' when Europe's migration crisis was at its most intense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move prompted a furious response from Italy who summoned Austria's ambassador to explain the developments in Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis also intervened by calling for a 'a renewed commitment for an authentic culture of welcome and solidarity'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics however said that the aggressive move by Austria was an attempt to prevent an upsurge in support for the country's far-right Freedom Party ahead of an election in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said there was 'no emergency' at the Brenner Pass, adding: 'I am frankly surprised by the comments [by Austrian officials].'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: 'This is an unjustified and unprecedented initiative which, if not immediately corrected, will inevitably create repercussions on security cooperation.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for Austria's Freedom Party flared during the peak of the migration in 2015 and 2016 when the country took in more than 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But HRW said the authority was &quot;failing to meet its responsibilities&quot; and sometimes &quot;arbitrarily&quot; recording ages above those given, sometimes using controversial dental examinations without any other evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those classified as adults are left to fend for themselves at heightened risk of exploitation, trafficking and other abuse, including prostitution, aid workers have warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They live in official and unofficial sites with unrelated adult single men; are exposed to inhumane living conditions, including overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and frequent incidents of violence; and are unable to go to school or otherwise access education,&quot; HRW said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its staff interviewed 20 asylum seekers who said they had been wrongly registered as adults by Greek authorities on Lesbos, with most reporting teeth examinations but not the interviews with psychologists and social workers required for full assessments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are among at least 60 people registered as adults who claim to be children according to other charities active on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eva Coss&eacute;, a HRW researcher for Greece, said: &quot;The misidentification of unaccompanied migrant kids on Lesbos as adults leads to real problems, including lumping them together with unrelated adults and denying them the care they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greek authorities need to take responsibility for properly identifying unaccompanied children and providing them the protection and care every child needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, HRW said children had themselves pretended to be adults in the belief they could avoid detention, before realising their mistake and attempting to correct the record - a process that can take so long they pass the age of 18 and lose rights including that of family reunification before it is resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid a lack of information and understanding among migrants arriving on boats, some have also been caught falsely claiming to be minors while over the age of 18 in attempts to secure help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of the trend last year sparked huge debate in the UK, including calls for dental checks from David Davis, although experts have warned the method is unreliable and can be wrong by up to three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Denmark's immigration servicesaid three quarters of asylum seekers claiming to be under 18 tested were found to be adults last year, while the Home Office said two thirds of refugees disputing their classification were shown to be adultsby examinations of their &quot;physical appearance and demeanour&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrival of almost onemillion asylum seekers in flimsy boats over the Aegean Sea since the start of 2015 has left Greece with a chronic shortage of space, which has worsened since the EU-Turkey deal came into force in March last year to see all new arrivals held in island camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When there is no space in safe shelters for unaccompanied children, authorities frequently detain them in police stations, immigration detention facilities and asylum processing centres, with 1,149 unaccompanied minors currently awaiting places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncertainty and distress provoked by the process is worsening anongoing mental health crisis in Greek camps, aid workers said, having already warned of increasing rates of suicide and self-harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samil, an Afghan boy who said he was 14 when he reached Lesbos, spent nine months living in a tent among adults before being transferred to the children's section in Moria with his brother.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vulnerable kids in Greece who have endured dangerous journeys far from their families should not have to fight for months just to prove they are children,&quot; Ms Coss&eacute; said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greece should do a better job identifying these children so they get the care they need and deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU-Turkey deal has dramatically cut the number of refugees arriving on Greekislands as deaths on the longer and more treacherous Central Mediterranean route pass the 2,300 mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But arrivals over the Aegean continue, with more than 1,800 unaccompanied child asylum seekers formally registered in Greece in the first five months of 2017, from countries including Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 13,000 asylum seekers are currently being held on Greek islands, where 10,000 more have arrived so far this year despite the threat of deportation to Turkey under the country's controversial deal with the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research by Save the Children previously found the agreement had dramatically reduced the number of refugees journeying to Greece but had given people smugglers &quot;a firmer grip on a hugely profitable business&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study by Harvard Universityfound girls as young as four had been rapedin an Athens refugee camp, while asylum seekers elsewhere in the country were selling sex to raise money to be smuggled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a House of Lords report found the Operation Sophia, the EU'santi-smuggling mission, has &quot;failed&quot;and may have contributed to rising deaths in the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 110,500 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year by sea, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, Bangladesh and Syria, with more than 2,300 dying in the attempt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest immigration statistics from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show nearly half (49 per cent) of people waiting for a decision on their asylum claim are waiting longer than six months - up from 39 per cent in the same quarter last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 10,552 people were waiting for more than six months in the months from July to September this year - an increase of 27 per cent on the same period in 2016.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in the number of people waiting longer than the six-month customer service target comes despite the new statistics also showing a sharp drop in the number of asylum applications of 21 per cent in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners have said the figures are &quot;disgraceful&quot; and serve as evidence that the Home Office is failing to make prompt and fair asylum decisions, urging that delays have a &quot;hugely damaging&quot; impact on people's mental health and chance to properly rebuild their lives in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes after research earlier this year showed asylum seekers werebeing wrongly denied emergency support they are legally entitled to from the Home Office while they wait for their claims to be processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by charity Refugee Action revealed individuals and families at risk of homelessness and with no means of supporting themselves are waiting an average of nearly two months for housing and the small amount of money they are entitled to (&pound;5.28 a day).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said: &quot;These figures are appalling evidence of the Home Office's failure to make prompt and fair asylum decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Incredibly, despite a fall in applications, nearly half of people are now waiting longer than the Government's six-month target for a decision on their asylum claim. During this time, people are left unable to work or integrate, struggling to survive on just &pound;5.28 a day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poor decision-making and delays are leaving families facing years of uncertainty, taking a tremendous toll on the wellbeing of people who have fled conflict and persecution. This has to change, and fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judith Dennis, policy manager at the Refugee Council, echoed his concerns, saying: &quot;It is disgraceful that the numbers of people having to wait for unbearably long periods for the Home Office to decide their fate has risen so drastically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This means more and more lives spent in limbo and fear, which can have a hugely damaging impact on people's mental health and chance to properly rebuild their lives here. These delays are indicative of an asylum system this is inefficient and needs urgent attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mammoth backlogs and overstretched capacity mean that the Home Office seems to lose sight of that fact that they are dealing with the lives of real people. The Home Office must address this issue immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Office immigration statistics released today alongside the ONS figures show that grants of asylum to main applicants and dependants have fallen by 9 per cent in the year to September 2017, while the number of people granted permission to stay permanently was down 5 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people provided with protection and support under a resettlement scheme is meanwhile up 30 per cent. A total of 6,348 refugees have been resettled in Britain over the past year, including 4,980 refugees welcomed through the Government's Syrian resettlement programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hale added: &quot;It's positive news that the Government is on track to meet its target of welcoming 20,000 refugees affected by the Syrian conflict to Britain by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But all refugees in Britain should have the same opportunity to rebuild their lives - starting with access to a fair and effective asylum system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said:&quot;The Home Office continues to meet its target to make an initial decision on 98% of straightforward asylum claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are committed to improving efficiency in this area and have plans in place to transform the asylum system. For example, in Spring this year, we opened a new office which will focus on the more complex cases and make sure that they are decided faster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An asylum case that does not get decided within sixmonths is usually classed as a &quot;non-straightforward&quot; asylum case, which the Home Office sayscases not possible to decide within sixmonths for reasons outside of theircontrol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS you read this, I am flying home from the most distressing visit in my many travels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With seven MPs and two other Peers, I travelled with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to witness the plight of the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in the sprawling camp in Bangladesh that is now their home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of our guides, Catherine Mahoney, of the International Rescue Committee, who has worked in refugee camps in Rwanda, Congo and Yemen, told us it is the worst she has ever seen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more than 600,000 men, women and children, it is like a city the size of Manchester or Glasgow without a hospital, a school or sanitary disposal. It is a living hell. As we stood on a hill in the centre, tents stretched in every direction as far as the eye could see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tide of humanity fleeing ethnic cleansing, brutal murder and sexual violence is nothing less than genocide - and it continues apace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were five thousand new arrivals in the few days before our visit and in the middle of one of our meetings, the refugee coordinator was told 50 more had just arrived by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the women were pregnant and gave birth almost as soon as they arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others were taken to &quot;stabilisation centres&quot; at which the coordinator said they were &quot;taken back to life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya people had been just coping until August 25 when the huge purge by the Burmese military resulted in the current tsunami of people fleeing their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the greatest movement of people since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A people expelled from their homeland by a vicious military government because of their religion or, some are suggesting, because the authorities of Myanmar want their land for more lucrative use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We spoke to a 25-year-old who feels he is imprisoned there, even though it has no walls. He is stateless and cannot leave unless he is accepted in a third country and there is no hope of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most upsetting of all was seeing two families living under a tarpaulin by the side of a busy road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They eat, sleep and just barely exist. Speaking to them, I could not hold back my tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What hope is there for those children when we, the rest of the world, have turned our backs on them? And yet they are a resilient, intelligent and innovative people. I found even among the desolation and misery of their lives they were welcoming and I could raise a smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What can we and should we be doing? The immediate problem is malnutrition. They need food desperately and it is in short supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More needs to be done by governments through the World Food Programme and by all of us supporting charities such as Save the Children, who are doing all they can to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the camp needs to be made safe. Dysentery and other diseases, along with fire or floods, could kill hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitals, sanitation and clean water, as parts of a restructuring of the camp, must follow soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheik Hasina, who is described here as &quot;The Mother of Humanity&quot; and who has ultimate responsibility for the refugee camps, also needs to make them a much higher priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above all, we need to demand that the UN, our government and others, insist that the Myanmar military stop the genocide now or the flow of frightened people will continue and the total number of refugees could reach a staggering million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To compound the tragedy, this appalling disaster has not received the worldwide media coverage it deserves, perhaps because of all the crazy things competing with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our group are returning with a determination to raise its profile at Westminster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priti Patel would have been wiser to come with us to see the desperate plight and urgent needs of these refugees than visiting Israel and offering development assistance to the Israeli military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs will raise it at every opportunity in the Commons, as will Peers in the Lords, starting with a parliamentary question I have already tabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to try to let the Rohingyas know they have not been forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What hope is there for those children when we, the rest of the world, turn our backs? GEORGE FOULKES</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frightened Rabbit have just headlined their first festival - but they're equally excited to be playing in a Glasgow house next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Selkirk outfit are to play their smallest show in many years as part of Amnesty International's Give A Home campaign on September 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They'll be joined by the Fratellis and We Were Promised Jetpacks for the unique gig, which will take place inside a lucky local's home and is to raise awareness of the ongoing refugee crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 200 shows are taking place across the world to mark the event, and for Frightened Rabbit singer Scott Hutchison it was an easy decision to say yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's such an amazing worldwide event,&quot; says Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that it's a house with no PA system so it is as acoustic as you can get, and we're stripping back our gear for it, so it'll be a quiet, intimate show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't the first time that the band have tried to help refugees. The singer believes that it's important that bands do what they can to help those less fortunate, and take advantage of their position. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've released money on tour in the past for the Scottish Refugee Council by auctioning off drum-heads and things like that. We should always welcome those who are trying to make a better life for themselves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The creative arts can be quite a selfish existence and it's important to remind ourselves that there's more that we can do than just writing albums and playing shows. We can use the voice that we have to raise awareness, and cash as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a viewpoint that not everyone will share, with online debate about refugees often falling into mud-slinging and arguments. Scott has been caught up in that before, but won't let it affect his views.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did post once about raising money for the Scottish Refugee Council and there were vitriolic comments underneath that, which surprised me,&quot; he says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought our audience was a bit more open-minded. But although we're not necessarily going to change people's minds we're taking the stance that we'll keep doing our thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's an added bonus for Scott, as the gig might be quite near his own flat. After spending time living in Los Angeles, he returned to Glasgow last year and is enjoying being back in the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really enjoyed my time in LA, but coming home feels all the better after being in an alien place for the past 18 months,&quot; he says. &quot;It's good to be closer to the band, I'm 15 minutes away from the studio and that's made progress on the next album a lot quicker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new album suggests a bright future for the group, but the past year had both highs and lows. The band's future looked uncertain after Scott talked critically about both himself and the band on Twitter last year, saying that people shouldn't buy his music. He regrets taking to social media to talk so publicly, but feels there were some silver linings in the public support he received. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I turned to Twitter rather than doing the sensible thing and turning to family and friends, which I would recommend to anyone going through a turbulent time mentally,&quot; he reflects. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mental health issues can come even at what are outwardly perceived as the highest points. We were touring the world, celebrating releasing an album and all those things meant I should be happy, but it's not always the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now I feel much more stable. I guess part of being a creative person is that you have a masochistic tendency to tap into those feelings, and it can overwhelm you if they take hold. It's a balancing act and I haven't mastered it yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However since then there's been several highs for the lads, including a three night stint at the Barrowland last December, and a headline slot at the Electric Fields festival in Dumfries a few weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was their run of gigs at the Barras that carried a special emotion for Scott, though, coming after such a tough year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's something about the Barras that brings out a nutty edge in people and I enjoy that,&quot; he says.  &quot;It was a celebration because it's amazing to overcome obstacles and come out  stronger.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'pimps' roam the camps looking for easy prey, and once a woman or child has been convinced to enter prostitution, they are sold to brothels in nearby cities for &pound;5.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They round up young widows with children who have lost their husbands during the fighting in Myanmar, or look for families with unmarried girls which they cannot afford a dowry for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/930118260632064000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human trafficking, especially luring women and children into the sex trade is on the rise in the huge refugee camps in Bangladesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One pimp, a man in his mid-20s revealed the atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar has been 'good for business'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he and other pimps target women but that there is a demand for young children of both sexes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'People who end up alone, maybe who have had family members killed or who are in a very bad condition,' he told Sky News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They come into the business because the aid from the Government doesn't last for a long time and to earn money they go into prostitution.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For women who have two or three children they need money for their children's medicine, or the people who are poor and have four or five girls in the house, maybe they may have got one girl married and couldn't afford to get the other girls married because they need a large dowry.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women and children lured into the sex trade are transported from the refugee camps to nearby cities such as Cox's Bazar and Chittagong, but some are then taken abroad to India and Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the women are taken in groups of ten to 15, and that he is paid &pound;5 for each girl.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations said this week that they are aware of trafficking networks already in existence in southern Bangladesh's sprawling camps.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 618,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh after systematic killings, arson and rape by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since August 25&nbsp;in response to coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six out of ten of the new arrivals in the Bangladesh camps are children, providing a fertile hunting ground for traffickers looking for young girls to recruit as prostitutes, or as household staff for Bangladeshi families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of children have, at some point, been separated from their families amid the chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is a major, major risk,' said Jean Lieby, head of child protection at the U.N. children's agency (UNICEF) in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Young girls might enter into this type of trafficking and then end up in one of the big cities.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kateryna Ardanyan, an anti-trafficking specialist with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), said exploitation had become 'normalised' in the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Human traffickers usually adapt faster to the situation than any other response mechanism can. It's very important we try to do prevention.' Ardanyan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Funding dedicated to protecting Rohingya men, women and children from exploitation and abuse is urgently needed.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A  CHARITY which repairs second-hand bikes to give them to refugees and teaches asylum seekers how to cycle has opened a hub in Croydon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called The Bike Project, the charity has 16 London hubs where volunteers take donations of second-hand bikes, fix them and then donate them to asylum-seeking refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also run workshops teaching refugees how to ride, maintain and fix their bikes from the hubs with the aim of helping them learn vital skills and build long-term friendships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Run by volunteers Sarah Morpurgo and Nicola Hill, the Croydon hub, on Willis Road, was officially opened on August 7, with the first teaching class taking place on August 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah, who lives in Peckham and has been teaching female refugees between the ages of 15 and 19 to cycle for four years, said: &quot;For me, it's an amazing opportunity to see the girls I've been working with try something new, or continue to expand their range of skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of our girls are going through complex issues at the moment surrounding all sorts of things, from age assessments and legal issues to problems with foster placements, to missing home and re-adapting to a new environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Watching the girls cycle around, laughing, feeling a sense of ownership over their bikes and helmets and high-viz vests and putting themselves up to the challenge of learning something new made me really happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded in 2013, The Bike Project relies almost entirely on donations and volunteers, but does occasionally sell some of the bikes it refurbishes in order to generate more funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also runs a separate initiative which involves teaching women and girls how to ride a bike in an effort to encourage more of them to feel safe in the saddle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers at the project's hubs teach cycling proficiency, in an all-female environment, to complete beginners of all ages. The lessons run once a week, for 10 weeks, and all participants are given a bike at the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah, who led the first session in the borough on Tuesday, said it was &quot;exciting&quot; to see how many people were interested in taking part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our girls in Croydon were so excited about it and we had an amazing turn-out for our first session.&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had 12 participants, with five more set to join us next week,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the girls had ridden before, but not since they were six years old, so it was a real dream for them to get back on a bike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were racing around in no time, learning how to emergency brake, look behind themselves while riding and indicate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the other girls that were completely new to riding, they were matching up with their new bikes, and the girls got off to a brilliant start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Sarah and Nicola spread their time across the charity's 15 other London locations, they are only opening the Croydon centre on Mondays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the summer holidays, Sarah will also be running a cycling club for female refugees over the age of 15 at Croydon Sports Arena, off Albert Road, in South Norwood, as part of her involvement with Young Roots, a group which supports refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first session was on Monday, July 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;We started this girls group [at Young Roots] in September 2016, in response to [there being] more unaccompanied girls arriving in Croydon - lots of them trafficked. Another big factor was a real need for a safe, all-female space for the girls to meet other girls and bond, sing, dance, relax and talk about female-specific issues - particularly around health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The group has been thriving ever since, and we now have over 30 girls coming from a whole range of different countries including Vietnam,  Ethiopia, the Ivory Coast, the Congo, Albania and Somalia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more information about the new hub and the other Bike Project locations, or about Sarah's cycling club, visit: http://thebikeproject.co.uk/ or contact Sarah at sarah@youngroots.org.uk</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ice-addicted Afghan refugee accused of mowing down 17 pedestrians outside&nbsp; Melbourne 's Flinders Street Station has rambled about Muslims from his hospital bed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said Saeed Noori made comments while at St Vincent's under police guard, only hours after the horrific rampage on Thursday afternoon.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I don't know the exact detail, to do with Allah and some ramblings about ASIO (the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation),' Mr Patton said according to The Herald Sun.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Patton told The Project Noori made utterances about voices, dreams and about why he drove the Suzuki SUV through the busy crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Others are about that he did this act because of perceived harms committed on Muslims around the world,' he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There's a range of issues there.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noori has since been transferred from hospital to a holding centre to be interrogated by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 32-year-old tried to hide his face with his cuffed hands while sitting between two detectives as he left Melbourne Police Station heading for the&nbsp;Custody Centre below the Magistrates Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Afghan immigrant spent the previous 24 hours under police guard in hospital after crashing the white Suzuki Vitara into a tram stop bollard at the corner of Flinders and Elizabeth Streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives were not able to interview him due to his injuries from the crash and a struggle with an off-duty police sergeant who heroically wrestled him from the car before other officers arrested him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Patton said there were no signs in Noori's online activity that he planned the attack in advance, and that counter-terrorism specialists did not believe it was a terrorist attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We haven't excluded [him being motivated by terrorism]. We haven't seen any warning signs that there was any threat of violence,' he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Noori had a history of drug use and mental illness, stressing that investigators had not yet found any extremist or terrorist links to the horror rampage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators were still searching for a motive for Noori's alleged 'evil act' and it was hoped a formal interview, likely followed by criminal charges, would shed some light on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said it did not appear to be a terrorist attack but raided two homes in Heidelberg West - where Noori lives - and Oak Park in Melbourne's north on Thursday night, hours after the terrifying incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family members present were reportedly cooperatives as forensics teams seized electronic items from the homes that police will comb through for clues about Noori's motives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At this stage nothing has been found to indicate a linkage to extremism, a terrorist organisation or anything of a terrorist nature,' police told Daily Mail Australia on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noori&nbsp;arrived in Australia as a refugee in 2004 through a resettlement program, and had several run-ins with the law between 2008 and earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He came to Australia as a refugee. He did not come with a people smuggler, he came through the appropriate refugee, the normal refugee programs,' Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At this stage, because investigations are continuing, apart from that statement, there are no known links to any political issues or any, certainly any links to extremist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Therefore, the position I am advised off at the moment is that no terrorism link has been identified at this stage. I want to stress, there is a mass of material that is being investigated and nothing should be ruled out, nothing should be ruled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Now, whatever the motivation, this was a despicable and cowardly act, but I want to reassure all Australians that this is an isolated incident.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noori's legal issues started with a minor assault charge in 2010 that was dropped after he pleaded guilty to recklessly causing injury and was fined $800.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in June this year he was convicted and fined $1000 after pleading guilty to driving while unlicensed, using a mobile phone while driving, and failing to answer bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missing bail charges was from when he missed a court date for the driving offences, which occurred either early this year or late last year, and which he also faced court for in February.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nineteen people were injured in the incident, including the driver and an off-duty policeman who heroic wrestled him from the car where other officers arrested him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE teenager suspected of planting the Parsons Green Tube bomb is a refugee from Iraq who came to the UK after his parents were killed, it was claimed last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCTV footage released yesterday shows a man with a Lidl bag like the one containing the bomb which exploded on the train, injuring 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With dark collarlength hair, in a maroon cap, he was pictured near the home of the suspect's elderly foster parents at 6.50am, just 90 minutes before a fireball ripped through the packed carriage on Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At The footage, obtained by ITV, was captured in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, which is just a 37-minute train ride from Wimbledon station, where the Tube that was bombed began its journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed police evacuated homes within 100 metres of the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sped to the house after an 18-year-old was arrested at 7.50am in Dover port on Saturday as he attempted to board a ferry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second suspect, aged 21 and from Syria, is believed to have been fostered previously by the same couple. He was held at a takeaway near Heathrow Airport. Police have not named him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the home of 21-year-old Yahyah Farroukh in nearby Stanwell was later searched. The modern mid-terrace house stands opposite the cargo bay at Heathrow Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his Facebook profile, Farroukh says he attended West Thames College in London in December 2015 and is originally from Damascus. In another profile, he says he came to Europe from Egypt to Italy on a migrant boat in 2014. It says he works as a nightclub promoter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suspect's home It is understood the first suspect had come to Britain as a 15-year-old after spending months attempting to smuggle himself into the UK, while living in the notorious makeshift Calais refugee camp known as The Jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee charity is believed to have helped his passage into Britain in 2014 and placed him in foster care with at least two families in Kent, before he moved in with the couple in South West London in the past few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative leader of Spelthorne Borough Council Ian Harvey - whose ward Sunbury East is close by - said last night: &quot;One thing I understand is that he was an Iraqi refugee who came here aged 15. His parents died in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foster parents Penelope and Ronald Jones, aged 71 and 88, received MBEs from the Queen in 2010 for services to children and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They took the teen into their home after nearly 40 years devoted to caring for vulnerable children. But neighbours said yesterday that the pair - who have looked after up to 300 children, including eight refugees - were &quot;at their wits' end&quot; with the teenager who had only been with them a short while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect, in custody on suspicion of planting the homemade bucket bomb on the London Underground, is said to have had a bust-up with them two weeks ago after being brought back to the house in a police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood he had been picked up at Parsons Green station - where the device combusted on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second suspect was being interrogated in connection with the attack last night. Anti-terror police seized him at a restaurant in Hounslow, West London, at midnight on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intelligence agencies are probing a theory that the pair could have been targeting the airport as well as the London transport network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed the second suspect was an asylum seeker, also taken in by Mr and Mrs Jones after arriving in the UK from war-torn Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland Yard forensics officers wearing protective overalls, hoods and face masks were inside the Stanwell flat throughout yesterday. It is believed no explosive materials were found there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Steven Griffiths, who lives across from Penny and Ron, told how police said the couple's home would be examined by forensics officers for &quot;at least a week&quot; after &quot;significant materials&quot; were found in the loft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I think that while Penny and Ron have been away, the lads were in the loft taking bit by bit down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was only yesterday when they said the guy had been making bombs in there that I thought: 'What?' This is all just crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Builder Dave Solway, 44, who also lives opposite the elderly couple, told of a row between the 18-year-old suspect and Ron outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lad was out the front shouting and swearing at Ron, telling him he was leaving. I know the couple were at their wits' end, I think they were told he was a lot younger than he is which is why they agreed to take him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poor Ron was trying to get the lad to go in the house but he just kept saying he wanted to leave for London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe this has happened to such nice people, I really feel for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family friend Jim Adaway, 37, said the Joneses had only recently returned to foster caring to help resettle youngsters from overseas, after requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I think Penny was getting in touch with the council and telling them she couldn't handle the teenager as he was out of control. I don't know if they felt it was the right decision to start taking kids on again which is such a shame after everything they've done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other neighbours told how terror police recovered explosives from the Joneses' house. A mum - who identified herself as Carrie and lives on the evacuated road - said police told her they had found 15 firearms at the house and a bomb in the garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police refused to comment on speculation about what was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary Amber Rudd yesterday said the UK's threat level has been lowered from critical to severe. She added: &quot;It still means an attack is highly likely, so I would urge everybody to continue to be vigilant but not alarmed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the country's top counterterrorism officer, said police were gaining a &quot;greater understanding of the preparation of the device&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security services are trying to find how the Iraqi teen entered the country and who he had associated with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just one person was last night still being treated in hospital following the bomb attempt - for serious wounds to their lower body.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Anita Roddick arrived at a Romanian orphanage in 1990 she was confronted with scenes of unimaginable horror. Listless toddlers, deprived of physical contact, were confined to their cots 24 hours a day and fed through the bars. The place was cold and stank of urine. In place of children's voices, an eerie silence reigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Body Shop founder had been so moved by the pictures of starved and shaven-headed orphans that ricocheted around the world after the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu's communist government in 1989 that she mobilised her company to send a small band of volunteers to help three orphanages in the village of Halaucesti. It is a mark of the character of a woman who left her fortune to charity when she died ten years ago that she took along her two daughters, Justine and Sam, then aged 20 and 18 respectively, so they could learn the importance of helping others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another volunteer was Rachel Bentley, a 22-year-old fresh out of law school. With the help of Roddick and the experience of working with institutionalised children gained in Romania, Ms Bentley went on to co-found the charity Children on the Edge, which is a beneficiary of this year's The Times Christmas appeal. It provides specialist help for vulnerable children in refugee camps in remote and strife-torn areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once you have seen those Romanian orphanages, you can't turn away. I told Anita that we either needed to leave or make a longer-term commitment, which is what we did,&quot; Ms Bentley says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then Children on the Edge has mobilised its considerable expertise, helping to integrate institutionalised and marginalised children back into society in Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Lebanon, India, Burma and India. For the past seven years it has been working to help the Rohingya refugee community in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are victims of a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign led by Burma, where the government refuses to accept the existence of the Rohingya as an ethnic group. An estimated 700,000 have fled murder, torture and rape, leaving the traditional aid infrastructure unable to cope. Working with local partners, Children on the Edge is providing primary education for Rohingya children in refugee camps, offering stable, safe spaces for them to learn, play and recover from the trauma they have been through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The atrocity has been going on for years and years, but for so long no one was interested. How much worse can it get than genocide?&quot; Ms Bentley says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity is small, with just 15 members of staff and an income of about &pound;1 million a year from grants and donations. Its approach of working with local partners to develop bespoke models of good practice for solving problems in each location allows it to punch above its weight. Because of this approach and its contacts with local agencies, it can often fill gaps left by international aid agencies and go to places where they do not feel safe or sufficiently knowledgeable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children on the Edge operates on a three to five-year timeframe and does not plan to dig in for ever but rather to hand over to its local partners for the long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we enter a situation, we always have an exit strategy,&quot; Ms Bentley says. &quot;We are not about building our brand or our organisation. We are about solving problems one at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donations to Children on the Edge will be matched by a donor who wishes to remain anonymous, up to the value of &pound;100,000.Children on the Edge is one of three charities supported by this year's Times Christmas appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One in four Rohingya children who recently fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar is now suffering from life-threatening malnutrition, with aid workers warning that refugees are &quot;essentially starving&quot; before they have even crossed the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preliminary findings of a joint nutrition assessment conducted in late October at Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar show that severe acute malnutrition rates among child refugees under five have doubled since May, while nearly half of young children are also underweight and suffering from anaemia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures - already above international emergency levels - are likely to increase, warned aid agencies, since the assessment surveyed only 10% of the population in need, and included families who had arrived before as well as after violence erupted in Rakhine state in August. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Up to 150 children under five die each day in Aung San Suu Kyi's Myanmar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once data is taken solely from new arrivals, malnutrition - and with it the risk of diarrhoea, dysentery, respiratory infections and measles - is expected to increase. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conditions we are seeing in Cox's Bazar create a perfect storm for a public health crisis on an unimaginable scale,&quot; said Cat Mahony, emergency response director in Cox's Bazar for the International Rescue Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These shocking figures substantiate the IRC's own findings on worrying food insecurity: three in four do not have enough food, and 95% of the population are drinking contaminated water. This is especially serious, as agencies report that two-thirds of the water in Cox's Bazar is contaminated with faeces.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malnutrition rates among children in northern Rakhine state were above emergency thresholds even before the recent exodus. But severe acute malnutrition has increased tenfold since last year, according to the joint assessment by Save the Children, IRC partner Action Against Hunger and Unicef. Conditions have worsened due to acute food and water shortages and unsanitary living quarters in Kutupalong camp, which is home to roughly 26,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     More than 600,000 Rohingya men, women, and children have crossed the border from Myanmar to Cox's Bazaar since August. These families joined an estimated 212,000 Rohingya previously living in Bangladesh. The IRC expects an additional 200,000 new arrivals in the weeks ahead, pushing the total refugee population to more than 1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Severe acute malnutrition can affect anyone but, if left untreated, children under five are up to nine times more likely to die than a well-nourished child. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New arrivals are often forced to set up camp far from the main road where food and medical distribution centres are located, said Save the Children's Rik Goverde, leaving many refugees facing a long walk simply to get one meal a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Malnutrition is rampant here, absolutely rampant, even among the adults,&quot; said Goverde, speaking by phone from Kutupalong camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two men just came into the clinic weighing 32kg and 34kg. This hasn't happened overnight - they have been hungry for a very long time and they are exhausted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New arrivals are required to register for an identity card in order to qualify for food distribution, Goverde said, which can take a few days to arrive. Many adults and children are consequently obliged to walk for hours into the forest, where they cut firewood in order to sell it and buy food. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are problems here on every sector - this isn't just about food and malnutrition,&quot; said Goverde. &quot;We're sure there are children suffering from mental health issues because they've suffered terrible things, they've lost their parents in the chaos, or seen their parents being shot. It's truly grim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef and other humanitarian agencies are currently treating more than 2,700 acutely malnourished children at 15 treatment centres. But the agencies are overstretched and underfunded, prompting the IRC to launch an emergency response on both sides of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, which the agency says will require $12m (&pound;9m) over the next year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response will include four 24-hour care centres to treat severe acute malnutrition, as well as six &quot;one stop shops&quot; that will deliver critical assistance and child protection. The aim will be to reach 80,000 refugees within the first six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two more nutrition evaluations are planned for this month, including one at a makeshift settlement. The findings from the three assessments will help update the projected number of children expected to suffer severe acute malnutrition over the next few months, guiding the emergency response, said Unicef's Jean-Jacques Simon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is an is an urgent need to prioritise families with malnourished children and come up with a minimum package of effective interventions to safeguard the health and wellbeing of these children,&quot; said Simon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Jemma Crew, Press Association</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Syrian refugee who was brought to the UK from Calais a year ago under the scheme lobbied for by Lord Alf Dubs has thanked the Government for his new start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ishmael Hamoud, who fled Syria in 2015 aged 15, spent more than a year in the Jungle migrant camp across the Channel, along with thousands of others hoping for a new start in the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He estimates he made more than a hundred attempts to get into the country by lorry and boat, before becoming one of 200 vulnerable children to be transferred in October last year when the camp was demolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost a year to the day that he arrived in England, the 18-year-old has thanked British authorities for their support and urged them to continue providing a safe haven for others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: ``My message is just to be thankful for the British Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The help they provide us is like...we cannot imagine, it's really important for us, so I want them to do this same experience with other people, to look after other people, because they built our lives again so that's really important for me to say thanks for them and to try the same experience again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The-then 17-year-old was bussed to the UK on October 25 along with hundreds of other children under the so-called Dubs Amendment aimed at helping vulnerable lone child refugees on mainland Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he is living with a foster family in north London and doing a foundation year at Birkbeck, University of London, to prepare for undergraduate studies in politics and international relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is excited about working for a career in politics, even joking that he is aiming to hold high office as the president of Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year on from his life-changing journey, he will be reunited with some of the other teenagers who were taken to safety from the camp, for a public thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hamoud and other refugees, accompanied by campaigners from Safe Passage and Help Refugees, will present a plaque to Parliament on Tuesday, which will be accepted by Lord Dubs, the scheme's architect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inscription reads: ``We thank the British people and Parliament for giving us peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We found a beautiful life in the UK, so different to the life we fled. We were suffering, but now we are safe.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hamoud said: ``For Syrian people, we lost our country, we lost our safety, we lost everything, and it's really important for the UK Government to try to give us a home, a safe life, it's really important for these people to try to help bring people here because they have nothing, the Syrian people, to do now, without any country and they need someone to look after them after all that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year it emerged that the Dubs scheme would close once 480 unaccompanied minors were brought to the UK - well below the 3,000 campaigners had called for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than half (approximately 200) have so far been resettled in the UK under the scheme, and charities are urging the Government to commit to bringing over the remainder by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities estimate between 700 and 800 refugees and migrants are gathered in Calais and the surrounding area - of which around 200 are unaccompanied minors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how he felt about this, Mr Hamoud said: ``It's really difficult because they are alone now without anyone looking after them, they cannot do anything, they just look around all the place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``So it's really important there's someone behind them and trying to support them to bring them here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokeswoman said: ``We continue to work closely with the French authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely under the Dublin Regulation and the Dubs Amendment.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Satellite photographs have revealed that Muslim Rohingya villages in Burma were destroyed after the country's government reached an agreement supposed to allow refugees to return home peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 40 villages were attacked in October and November, according to analysis of the images by Human Rights Watch (HRW), based in New York. This brings to 354 the number of settlements partially or completely razed in the campaign of arson, murder and rape by the Burmese security forces that followed an attack by Rohingya militants at the end of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close to 700,000 people are understood to have fled since then to Bangladesh, the largest so far in a wave of mass emigrations by the Rohingya, who have been persecuted and denied citizenship in Burma for decades.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total number of refugees in Bangladesh - close to one million - is now greater than the number who remain in their Burmese homeland, Rakhine state. The problem is putting intense pressure on the Bangladeshi government, which last month reached an agreement to begin returning refugees to Burma early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights groups and aid organisations, as well as many Rohingya, have expressed scepticism about the sincerity of Burma, which has been accused by the UN of ethnic cleansing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Burmese army's destruction of Rohingya villages within days of signing a refugee repatriation agreement with Bangladesh shows that commitments to safe returns were just a public relations stunt,&quot; said Brad Adams of HRW. &quot;Burmese government pledges to ensure the safety of returning Rohingya cannot be taken seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial satellite images analysed by HRW disprove a claim by Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto Burmese leader, that conflicts in Rakhine ended on September 5. At least 118 villages have been at least partially destroyed since that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 23 Bangladesh and Burma agreed to return refugees to Rakhine. The satellite photographs show that between November 25 and December 2 at least four villages in Maungdaw township were burnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bimal Chandra Dey Sarker of the Bangladeshi aid organisation Mukti, said that between 60,000 and 70,000 more Rohingya had crossed into Bangladesh this month. &quot;The recent arrivals say that even if their villages are intact, they can't buy essentials in the markets,&quot; he said. &quot;The vendors have been told not to sell food to Rohingya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crackdown followed attacks by members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army on August 25 that killed a few dozen people. The response was described by Zeid Raad al-Hussein, UN human rights chief, as &quot;a textbook example of ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the BBC shown last night he hinted that Ms Suu Kyi could face future charges of genocide. He said that he telephoned the Nobel peace prize winner last January to beg her personally to bring an end to persecution of the Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I appealed to her emotional standing to do whatever she could to bring this to a close,&quot; he told BBC's Panorama. &quot;To my great regret this didn't seem to happen. The elements suggest you cannot rule out the possibility that acts of genocide have been committed. Given the scale of the military operation, clearly these would have to be decisions taken at a high level. If it came to your knowledge that this was being committed and you did nothing to stop them then you could be culpable as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 19, 2017<BR><BR>As the number of Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh surpasses 400,000, United Nations agencies are scaling up their efforts to assist the displaced and Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres renewed his call on the authorities in Myanmar to take steps to address the crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are all shocked by the dramatic escalation of sectarian tensions in Myanmar's Rakhine state,&quot; Mr. Guterres remarked today in his address to the opening of the General Assembly's high-level debate. &quot;A vicious cycle of persecution, discrimination, radicalization and violent repression has led more than 400,000 desperate people to flee, putting regional stability at risk.&quot;<BR><BR>He stressed that the authorities in Myanmar must end the military operations, allow unhindered humanitarian access and recognize the right of refugees to return in safety and dignity. They must also address the grievances of the Rohingya, whose status has been left unresolved for far too long, he added.<BR><BR>Marzuki Darusman, the Chairperson of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva that it is clear that there is &quot;a grave humanitarian crisis&quot; underway that requires urgent attention.<BR><BR>In addition to the over 400,000 people who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since 25 August, Mr. Darusman noted that there are reports that nearly 200 Rohingya villages in the affected area have been emptied.<BR><BR>&quot;It is important for us to see with our own eyes the sites of these alleged violations and abuses and to speak directly with the affected people and with the authorities,&quot; he stated, noting that the Commission has requested the Government of Myanmar for unfettered access to the country. UN aid agencies scaling up assistance<BR><BR>As the number of those crossing the border into Bangladesh increases, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is ramping up its operations, including moving new arrivals into family tents and temporary communal shelters at a new extension site next to the Kutupalong camp near Cox's Bazar.<BR><BR>Spokesperson Duniya Aslam Khan told a news conference in Geneva that refugees have told UNHCR staff that they suffered from cold and rain during their treks from Myanmar.<BR><BR>&quot;Many had fallen ill, particularly small children. There is urgent need for more latrines, not least to reduce risks of a spread of disease with so many people living in close quarters. Many also complained of hunger and said they had eaten little on their journeys, which took up to 10 days on foot,&quot; she stated.<BR><BR>With an estimated 415,000 refugees having arrived since late August the humanitarian challenges have become immense, according to UNHCR, which noted the &quot;remarkable generosity&quot; by many individual Bangladeshis, with people trucking food and clothes to the refugees in the camps and others camping along the single main road.<BR><BR>However, the Government needs more support, and UNHCR will be issuing an appeal this week for the emergency humanitarian response in Bangladesh till the end of year.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) is providing critical support to step-up health services delivery in Cox's Bazar.<BR><BR>&quot;Vulnerable populations require access to health services, including emergency and basic health care. Access for women to reproductive health services is especially important,&quot; noted Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director for WHO South-East Asia.<BR><BR>The agency added in a news release that poor nutrition, communicable diseases (including vaccine-preventable and water-borne diseases), injuries and other concerns such as mental health provide immense public health challenges that the Bangladeshi Ministry of Health, WHO and other health partners are working to address.         </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pope Francis ended a diplomatically tricky trip to Asia on Saturday by seeking the forgiveness of Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh after his controversial decision to not directly refer to their plight when he visited their homeland, Myanmar.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the last day of his three-day visit to Bangladesh, which came after meetings in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, the pope went to a home in Dhaka founded by Mother Teresa for orphans, unwed mothers and destitute elderly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in a speech to an audience of around 7,000 young Catholics, Muslims and followers of other religions, the pope spoke about welcoming and accepting those who 'act and think differently than ourselves'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'When a people, a religion or a society turns into a 'little world', they lose the best that they have and plunge into a self-righteous mentality of 'I am good and you are bad',' Francis said at the Notre Dame College, founded by Catholic priests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also asked his young listeners to 'not spend the whole day playing with your phone and ignoring the world around you!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis said he was very pleased by an inter-religious meeting on Friday night, where he had an emotional meeting with refugees from Myanmar and then used the word Rohingya for the first time on his current trip, saying they had God within them and should be respected. He also sought their forgiveness in the name of all who persecuted them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously, in Myanmar, he followed the advice of Myanmar Church officials who said his use of the word could prompt a backlash against Christians and hurt that country's fragile path to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That had disappointed rights groups such as Amnesty International, which has said Myanmar's 'security forces were carrying out a systematic, organized and ruthless campaign of violence against the Rohingya population.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar's military has denied the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country does not recognise the stateless Rohingya as an ethnic group with its own identity and considers them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pope had faced criticism from some rights activists and refugees for failing to address the issue publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not visit the refugee camps, where only a handful were aware that one of the world's most high-profile leaders was championing their cause just 300 miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One refugee expressed gratitude that the pope had finally uttered the word Rohingya, and said he believed the meeting would have a big impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is the first time that a great world leader has listened to us,' 29-year-old Rohingya teacher Mohammad Zubair said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This meeting will send a clear message to global leaders.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Yangon-based analyst David Mathieson said the tour would 'do nothing dramatically to alter the humanitarian disaster of Rakhine' in Myanmar, where the violence against the Rohingya has unfolded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think the Pope's strategy for his visit to Bangladesh was to keep international attention focused on the immense humanitarian crisis... and provide some inspiration for the Christians of Myanmar,' he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 10-year-old refugee, who has attracted global attention and the nickname of &quot;the little Picasso&quot; for his artistic talent, is holding his first exhibition - and donating all the money raised at the event to a sick Serbian boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhad Nouri has been living in a refugee camp with his parents and two younger brothers in Belgrade's Krnja?a neighbourhood for the past eight months. The family was forced to flee conflict and poverty in their home country of Afghanistan two years ago, travelling through Greece and Turkey before arriving in Serbia. They hope to eventually start a peaceful new life somewhere in Western Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhad describes childhood in his temporary home as &quot;very difficult&quot; but says he tries to use art as a release from the suffering because when he draws he can think of nothing else. &quot;Only people here could really understand [how life is]. It's so bad for me,&quot; he told The Independent. &quot;If you spent one week in this camp you would be crazy but I feel very good when I'm drawing. I feel better and I don't think about how it was in Afghanistan. When I'm drawing I'm relaxed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spirited 10-year-old, who learned to speak English in just a year, began drawing at six years old after growing up watching his father create arabesque art in Afghanistan. He discovered he had a flair for drawing and has since sold artwork in Greece and Serbia. Farhad continues to hone his technique and spends his days sketching the people who inspire him, including Novak Djokovic, Cristiano Ronaldo, Angela Merkel, Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso - his hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I started to paint at six years old I could not draw like I do now back then,&quot; he said. &quot;Now my favourite thing I like to paint is faces and portraits. I feel very good when I draw these people. Especially Picasso because he is my favourite artist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Farhad, the exhibition is more than just a means of sharing his photographs, drawings and paintings with the world. He wants to use it to change the way people think and that, he says, is why choosing the name of the show was so important to him. He eventually decided to call it We Need Kindness - The Dream of a Ten-Year-Old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I'm very happy. When I found out I was having the exhibition I didn't know what to do [because of the excitement]. I spent all day thinking about what the name of it should be. I was talking to my father about being a refugee. He told me how difficult he finds it and I thought, 'do you know what we need? We need kindness'. So I remembered that name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But beyond this noble act, Farhad also wants to use the art show to make a difference to the life of a seven-year-old Serbian boy, whose family are fundraising to help pay for lifesaving treatment at a specialist clinic in Paris. When he heard about his story he knew he had to do something to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want any children in the world to be afraid of anything,&quot; he said. &quot;Because of that I decided I won't sell my paintings for lots of money but instead I will put a box out and anyone who wants to donate can give for the sick boy. We need that kindness. I want to help him and to show other people how they can help him and show their kindness. I can understand people and I think we all need kindness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition, which opens at the Slow Caf&eacute; in Belgrade tomorrow, has been organised in collaboration with Help Refugees and Serbian photography school Fabrika Fotografa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sian Pilkington, a field representative at Help Refugees said: &quot;Farhad is an intelligent boy with extraordinary talent, we are very happy to celebrate his artwork. It's a fantastic opportunity to reflect on a positive story rather than the negative stories of the refugee crisis that are in the media. We hope that Farhad is given all the opportunities that any 10-year-old deserves to achieve his dreams in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A  charity which repairs second-hand bikes to give them to refugees and teaches asylum seekers how to cycle has opened a hub in Croydon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called The Bike Project, the charity has 16 London hubs where volunteers take donations of second-hand bikes, fix them and then donate them to asylum-seeking refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also run workshops teaching refugees how to ride, maintain and fix their bikes from the hubs with the aim of helping them learn &quot;vital&quot; skills and build &quot;long-term&quot; friendships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Run by volunteers Sarah Morpurgo and Nicola Hill, the Croydon hub, on Willis Road, was officially opened on Monday, August 7, with the first teaching class taking place on August 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah, who lives in Peckham and has been teaching female refugees between the ages of 15 and 19 to cycle for four years, said: &quot;For me, it's an amazing opportunity to see the girls I've been working with try something new, or continue to expand their range of skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of our girls are going through complex issues at the moment surrounding all sorts of things, from age assessments and legal issues to problems with foster placements, to missing home and re-adapting to a new environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Watching the girls cycle around, laughing, feeling a sense of ownership over their bikes and helmets and high-viz vests and putting themselves up to the challenge of learning something new made me really happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded in 2013, The Bike Project relies almost entirely on donations and volunteers, but does occasionally sell some of the bikes it refurbishes in order to generate more funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also runs a separate initiative which involves teaching women and girls how to ride a bike in an effort to encourage more of them to feel safe in the saddle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers at the project's hubs teach cycling proficiency, in an all-female environment, to complete beginners of all ages. The lessons run once a week, for 10 weeks, and all participants are given a bike at the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah, who led the first session in the borough on Tuesday, said it was &quot;exciting&quot; to see how many people were interested in taking part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our girls in Croydon were so excited about it and we had an amazing turn-out for our first session.&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had 12 participants, with five more set to join us next week,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the girls had ridden before, but not since they were six years old, so it was a real dream for them to get back on a bike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were racing around in no time, learning how to emergency brake, look behind themselves while riding and indicate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the other girls that were completely new to riding, they were matching up with their new bikes, and the girls got off to a brilliant start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Sarah and Nicola spread their time across the charity's 15 other London locations, they are only opening the Croydon centre on Mondays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the summer holidays, Sarah will also be running a cycling club for female refugees over the age of 15 at Croydon Sports Arena, off Albert Road, in South Norwood, as part of her involvement with Young Roots, a group which supports refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first session was on Monday, July 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;We started this girls group [at Young Roots] in September 2016, in response to [there being] more unaccompanied girls arriving in Croydon - lots of them trafficked. Another big factor was a real need for a safe, all-female space for the girls to meet other girls and bond, sing, dance, relax and talk about female-specific issues - particularly around health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The group has been thriving ever since, and we now have over 30 girls coming from a whole range of different countries including Vietnam,  Ethiopia, the Ivory Coast, the Congo, Albania and Somalia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more information about the new hub and the other Bike Project locations, or about Sarah's cycling club, visit http://thebikeproject.co.uk/ or contact Sarah at sarah@youngroots.org.uk</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;APPALLING conditions&quot; have been uncovered at houses used for some of society's most vulnerable people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now one councillor has called for its residents to be rehomed and a full investigation into how the issue was allowed to develop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-for-profit Palm Cove Society is paid by public bodies to provide shelter to victims of modern slavery, refugees, asylum seekers and people fleeing violence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But broken beds, missing fire alarms, doors and windows off their hinges and defective cookers were just some of the problems clearly visible when the Telegraph &amp; Argus visited some of its 32 homes in the Bradford district. At one house, an Iraqi refugee described making many complaints to Palm Cove Society staff, such as being left without hot water or heating for weeks, but said nothing ever seemed to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In broken English, he described the conditions as &quot;awful&quot;, adding: &quot;I'm a refugee, but I wasn't born in mud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another house, an Iranian refugee described how he had been forced to sleep on blankets on the floor for more than a year, because his bed was broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new oven had been delivered several months ago to replace the current faulty one, he said, but had never been fitted and had just been left in the living room. The T&amp;A has withheld the exact location of the homes and the names of the tenants for their own protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned councillor Zafar Iqbal (Lab, Bradford Moor) said he was calling on Bradford Council's housing standards team to inspect the properties and serve improvement notices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;It was shocking and disappointing to see vulnerable people who have fled from war zones to be living in such appalling conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will be speaking to Council officers to inspect each property and identify defects and serve notices to the landlord for immediate repairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the situation was &quot;shocking&quot; and the homes were &quot;not suitable for living conditions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Palm Cove Society's founders, husband-and-wife team Gerard Stocks and Yvonne Hall, have said they themselves had been shocked to uncover the problems when they held their annual inspection last month, and have since started a major renovation programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair said they had got into the business precisely because Ms Hall had seen vulnerable people in bad housing conditions in her previous work as a midwife and had wanted to do something to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they said in recent months they had been giving in-depth support to a woman raised in a Brixton cult and had entrusted their staff to keep the houses in good condition. Ms Hall said when they went to do their annual inspection last month, they were&nbsp;&quot;horrified&quot; by what they found. She said: &quot;I couldn't believe what I was seeing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Stocks said: &quot;We feel totally and utterly disappointed. I think I can be guilty sometimes of putting too much faith in people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they had since started a major programme of repairs, which had cost them &pound;15,000 in the first 20 days alone, and had taken on four new maintenance staff. He said they hoped to finish the work in the next few months and would likely face a bill of a further &pound;60,000 to &pound;70,000. The couple showed the T&amp;A around some of the homes currently under refurbishment. Mr Stocks said the company was not making any money from its tenants and made a loss of &pound;20,000 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities and other agencies can refer people to Palm Cove Society properties. Bradford Council is one of those who uses its services and is also listed as a sponsor on its website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bradford Council spokesman said: &quot;When the standard of these three properties was raised with us we sought an urgent meeting with Palm Cove, which we have now had. One of our officers visited the properties to inspect. It is obvious some repairs and renovations are required. We have been assured by the Palm Cove directors that all repairs and maintenance will be attended at these three properties and management concerns are addressed. We are in the process of agreeing a timetable for the identified actions with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone in Bradford has a right to a decent home to live in and we expect all housing providers to measure up to that. Any that we find not doing so will be enforced against by our Housing Standards team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman said Bradford Council currently had 19 people placed in other Palm Cove-owned properties but have none in the ones visited by the T&amp;A. The Council said those 19 people had not raised concerns with it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A truck filled with aid for Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh veered off a road and fell into a ditch onThursday morning, killing at least nine aid workers, hours after another aid shipment in the refugees' violence-wracked home state in Burmawas attacked by a Buddhist mob.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both shipments were from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Aid groups face different challenges on either side of the border: An influx of more than 420,000 refugees in less than a month in Bangladesh, and in Burma, government resistance and angry allegations from majority Buddhists that international organisations are favouring the long-persecuted Rohingya minority.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bangladeshi medical administrator, Aung Swi Prue, said six people died instantly in the truck crash near the border in southeastern Bandarban district. Three people died after reaching a hospital, and 10 others were injured and are receiving treatment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ICRC spokeswoman Misada Saif said all of those killed were Bangladeshi workers hired to distribute food packages to 500 Rohingya families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saif said the truck belongs to the ICRC and Bangladesh Red Crescent Society and was operated by a supplier who has been working for the two agencies for last couple of weeks. She said agency officials are &quot;very shocked and sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our thoughts are with the families of the dead. They were there to help the people who desperately need help,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya exodus began 25August, after Rohingya insurgent attacks on police set off a military crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands of homes have been burned in what many Rohingya have described as a systematic effort by Burma'smilitary to drive them out. The government has blamed the Rohingya, even saying they set fire to their own homes, but the UN and others accuse it of ethnic cleansing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most refugees have ended up in camps in the Bangladeshi district of Cox's Bazar, which already had hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who had fled prior rounds of violence. Bandarban is a neighbouring district where thousands of Rohingya also have fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence in Burmaoccurred just across the border in Rakhine state, where police said a Buddhist mob threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers Wednesday night as they tried to block Red Cross supplies from being loaded onto a boat. The vessel was headed to an area where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have chased from their homes. No injuries were reported and police detained eight of the attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of people arrived at a jetty in the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe, as a boat was being loaded bottled water, blankets, mosquito nets, food and other supplies. As the crowd swelled to 300, they started throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at the officers, who responded by firing into the air, said police officer Phyo Wai Kyaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of the predominantly Buddhist nation of 60 million said police and several monks showed up to try to defuse tensions. The shipment ultimately was loaded and sent to northern Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Burma'sleader, Aung San Suu Kyi, told diplomats this week humanitarian assistance was being sent to those who remain in northern Rakhine, the government has blocked all UNassistance to the area, granting access to only the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are explaining to the community members who approached the boats about the activities of the Red Cross,&quot; said Maria Cecilia Goin, a communications officer at the ICRC in Yangon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important for them to understand that we are working in neutral and impartial way,&quot; she said, adding that the work is being done &quot;with full transparency with the Burmaauthorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suu Kyi's speech this week in Naypyitaw, the capital, defended her government's conduct in Rahkine state and avoided criticism of the military. The country's top general went a step further, travelling to northern Rakhine on Thursday to praise security forces for their &quot;gallant&quot; efforts to defend Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting with military officials and their families in Buthiduang township, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Min Aung Hlaing said that more than a century ago when the area was a British colony, Rohingya - whom he referred to as &quot;Bengalis&quot; - were allowed to settle without restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Later, the Bengali population exploded and the aliens tried to seize the land of local ethnics,&quot; Min Aung Hlaing said, according to his office's Facebook page. He described repeated army efforts since Burmaindependence in 1948 to &quot;to crush the mujahedeen insurgents,&quot; including in 2012 and last fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Race cannot be swallowed by the ground, but only by another race,&quot; he said. &quot;All must be loyal to the state in serving their duties, so that such cases will never happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Vivian Nouri was born into a Syrian refugee camp, her family's immediate priority was replacing their home which had been destroyed by a bomb.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollywood seemed a long, long way away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fast forward to 2017, and now it looks like Tinseltown could become Vivian's second home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A life-changing moment for the New Zealand songstress came in the form of a recent call from the music supervisor at Paramount Pictures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was asked if she could get to the studio in one hour and record a song that had a shot at getting on the soundtrack the sequel to a hit feature film.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She dropped everything.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nouri knew it isn't everyday that an opportunity to record a song for a major motion picture comes along.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stunning 24-year-old told Daily Mail Australia she was delighted just to be given a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I was at the gym and the next I get a call from the music supervisor at Paramount Pictures to sing a Christmas song for one of the scenes in the movie,' she said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Grammy season and she had been approached by Jason Richmond who she had been introduced to earlier in the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I had met him at a pre-Grammy party and we've been friends since then.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He called me one morning and knew my vocal range but asked my if I could sing this Christmas song for a movie. I wasn't going to say no whether I knew how to sing it or not.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The catch was that she had to get to the studio in an hour and do the song immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I dropped everything and left to the studio. I learned the song on the spot and sang it within an hour and a half.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The song was recorded at the same studio where Michael Jackson and Lionel Ritchie recorded 'We Are The World'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A week later I got an email saying that the song was locked in the movie, and I was in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I messaged my mum straight away along with the rest of my family and they were over the moon.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been a long road for the Syrian-born beauty whose life began in a refugee camp in 1993.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her family had fled a civil war in Kurdistan after their home was destroyed by a bomb in 1991.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of her older sisters needed urgent medical attention and they were granted refugee status in New Zealand.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nouri and her family arrived to their new home in 1995 and she's called the country 'home' ever since.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'One of my older sisters needed urgent medical attention and we were granted refugee status in New Zealand. She's actually a lawyer now. We are all proud kiwis.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She began singing at the age of nine and her family began to recognise her potential when she received a standing ovation in primary school for her performance of 'When You Believe' by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the age of 10 she was singing at&nbsp;variety of local events and contests.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009 she won a Five Minutes of Fame competition held in Albany, on Auckland's North Shore. The organiser invited her to perform for former Prime Minister John Key and other members of parliament at the Style Pasifika Fashion Show.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then she has persistently showcased her talent, uploading videos to her YouTube channel and her&nbsp; Facebook  page and her Instagram.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'I have been working with Grammy award winning producer, Brian Kennedy and Davix Foreman - a multi platinum producer/vocal engineer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Fortunately I was able to record a number of songs at well known studios in LA meeting a number of big names in the industry such as Fifth Harmony, Skrillex and G-Eazy.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in LA she has attended a number of events and met influential people who took her under their wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What I love about music is the power of it to inspire and bring people together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Emotionally connecting with people all over world is a feeling I will never get used to.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">christmas appeal When Anita Roddick arrived at a Romanian orphanage in 1990 she was confronted with scenes of unimaginable horror. Listless toddlers, deprived of physical contact, were confined to their cots 24 hours a day and fed through the bars. The place was cold and stank of urine. In place of children's voices, an eerie silence reigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Body Shop founder had been so moved by the pictures of starved and shaven-headed orphans that ricocheted around the world after the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu's communist government in 1989 that she mobilised her company to send a small band of volunteers to help three orphanages in the village of Halaucesti. It is a mark of the character of a woman who left her fortune to charity when she died ten years ago that she took along her two daughters, Justine and Sam, then aged 20 and 18 respectively, so they could learn the importance of helping others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another volunteer was Rachel Bentley, a 22-year-old fresh out of law school. With the help of Roddick and the experience of working with institutionalised children gained in Romania, Ms Bentley went on to co-found the charity Children on the Edge, which is a beneficiary of this year's The Times Christmas appeal. It provides specialist help for vulnerable children in refugee camps in remote and strife-torn areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once you have seen those Romanian orphanages, you can't turn away. I told Anita that we either needed to leave or make a longer-term commitment, which is what we did,&quot; Ms Bentley says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then Children on the Edge has mobilised its considerable expertise, helping to integrate institutionalised and marginalised children back into society in Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Lebanon, India, Burma and India. For the past seven years it has been working to help the Rohingya refugee community in Bangladesh. The refugees are victims of a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign led by Burma, where the government refuses to accept the existence of the Rohingya as an ethnic group. An estimated 700,000 have fled murder, torture and rape, leaving the traditional aid infrastructure unable to cope. Working with local partners, Children on the Edge is providing primary education for Rohingya children in refugee camps, offering stable, safe spaces for them to learn, play and recover from the trauma they have been through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The atrocity has been going on for years and years, but for so long no one was interested. How much worse can it get than genocide?&quot; Ms Bentley says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity is small, with just 15 members of staff and an income of about &pound;1 million a year from grants and donations. Its approach of working with local partners to develop bespoke models of good practice for solving problems in each location allows it to punch above its weight. Because of this approach and its contacts with local agencies, it can often fill gaps left by international aid agencies and go to places where they do not feel safe or sufficiently knowledgeable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children on the Edge operates on a three to five-year timeframe and does not plan to dig in for ever but rather to hand over to its local partners for the long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we enter a situation, we always have an exit strategy,&quot; Ms Bentley says. &quot;We are not about building our brand or our organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are about solving problems one at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But does this image show the Parsons Green bomber on his way to carry out the Tube attack? The footage was taken just 90 minutes before the blast on a packed District Line train. The man was captured on film near the home of Ronald and Penny Jones - the foster parents of an 18-year-old Iraqi refugee who is being questioned by police over the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shopping bag he is carrying matches the one that held the Parsons Green bomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primed with an explosive known as 'Mother of Satan', a timer and fairy lights, the device could have killed dozens. It failed to detonate properly, however, injuring 29.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, it emerged that the home of a second refugee, who is believed to have family in Scotland, is also being Turn to Page 4 Continued from Page One investigated over the attack. Police spent yesterday searching the Heathrow home of Yahya Faroukh, a 21-year-old Syrian refugee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments: ? Neighbours claimed the 18-yearold was a tearaway who was held by police just two weeks ago at the same Parsons Green station and had been spoken to by officers 'several times'; ? It emerged that he had been arrested by chance at Dover; ? There were questions over the child refugee foster system amid concerns about the 18-year-old's behaviour; ? Defence Secretary Michael Fallon demanded that internet giants do more to take down extremist material; ? The terror threat level was lowered from 'critical' to 'severe'. Although the threat level was lowered, sources claimed last night that police and MI5 were still hunticant', ing another Syrian suspected of being involved in the plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a dramatic 48 hours following the attack in West London, the 18-year-old who is suspected of planting the powerful device on a rush hour Tube train was arrested by chance as he attempted to flee the country on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police pounced on the 18-yearold, who has yet to be identified, when two unarmed officers from Kent Police spotted him at the Port of Dover at 7.50am as he tried to buy a ferry ticket to Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that as many eight SAS soldiers were part of the operation in Dover. Witnesses described seeing the teenager being spoken to calmly by two officers, before armed police and special forces moved in to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after his arrest, which Scotland Yard described as 'signif-a second suspect was detained at a takeaway shop in Hounslow, west London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The identity of the 21-year-old was not released, but police were yesterday searching the home of Syrian refugee Faroukh, in the shadow of Heathrow. He also previously lived in Sunbury with the Joneses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the arrests Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced that the terror threat level had been reduced from its highest level of critical to severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country had been warned that a terrorist attack could be 'imminent' after the Parsons Green suspect went on the run, but yesterday the immediate danger appeared to be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the 18-year-old suspect and Faroukh are thought to have arrived in Britain several years ago as refugees, having travelled across Europe to get to the so-called Jungle camp at Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an unaccompanied child the teenager was allowed entry to the UK and after being processed through a migrant centre in Kent, was found a home with the Joneses. The family are also thought to have taken in Faroukh who had travelled from his native Syria for a better life here in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police swooped at the home of their foster parents on Saturday, where bomb disposal experts were brought in. Neighbours were evacuated from surrounding homes amid fears of a second bomb being hidden at the suburban property, which was still being searched last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday neighbours described the 18-year-old living there as a teenage tearaway and it was claimed that he had been spoken to by police many times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation sparked speculation that US President Donald Trump was right when he tweeted about the suspected bomber being 'in the sights' of Scotland Yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This caused a diplomatic row because Theresa May and police both condemned his 'unhelpful' intervention. Yesterday it emerged that Mr and Mrs Jones, who took the 18-year-old in after he arrived in Dover three years ago, were 'at the end of their tether' with the youngster after a series of run-ins with the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carers have raised 268 foster children over three decades - including eight refugees. They were awarded MBEs by the Queen for their services to children and families. But friends said they had been unable to cope with the 'problematic foster child' who was said to be out of control. Questions were being asked yesterday about why he was placed with the Christian family after concerns from the 18-year-old's Muslim's relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of their former foster children said the Joneses had taken on 'difficult teenagers recently' including an Iraqi refugee who fled Baghdad arriving in Dover three years ago and a Somalian boy, both of whom were placed with the couple from a refugee centre in Dover. Last night a close family friend said the foster parents, who are now staying with friends, were distraught at his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'To say they are gutted is an understatement,' the friend said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For this to happen, after all the thousands of kids they have fostered and for it to ruin everything. Aaron Nye, a former foster child of the couple, said: 'It's shocking. I really feel for the Penny and Ron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's dreadful for them and it has made me quite emotional - they never asked for any of this and they have been so good to so many kids.' His mother, Tracy Nye, said the 18-year-old had been trouble for the couple. Neighbours on the quiet street said one of the teenagers living at the property had been arrested at Parsons Green station two weeks ago but was later returned home. Serena Barber, 47, said: 'They have two boys at the moment, both are foreign. One is very quiet and polite, the other, who is 18, is awful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I know about two weeks ago he was arrested by police at Parsons Green, for what I don't know and returned back to Penny and Ron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'After that Penny said she was going to have to stop caring for him, she couldn't handle him.' Stephen Griffiths, 28, who lives across the road, said: 'Police have been at this address a few times in the last couple of weeks. At the time we just put it down to it being foster kids that needed to be spoken to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Why couldn't something be done sooner to stop this happening? Why couldn't the police have questioned him? 'Three or four officers would turn up and would speak to the foster parents on the doorstep.' Another neighbour Dave Solway said the refugee wanted to run away, while one mother of two said there had been clashes about placing the Muslim teenager, who spoke Arabic, with Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: 'I saw the boys, they were quiet. I asked the younger one if he wanted to come to my church to help settle in and meet people, he didn't. His main family are Muslim, they are not happy he is with a Christian family.' Comment - Page 18</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At the end of their tether'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">729 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cory Bernardi's Australian Conservatives party will advocate withdrawing from the United Nations refugee convention and halving the immigration intake in an election platform that will put political pressure on the Coalition as it attempts to woo back disaffected rightwing voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian Conservatives has uploaded a new policy manifesto to its website which advocates &quot;immediately&quot; halving Australia's net immigration intake and withdrawing from the UN refugee convention to allow Australia to determine its refugee intake &quot;free from external constraints&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'It's the vibe': Cory Bernardi says Liberals flocking to Australian Conservatives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party also advocates that family reunion should only be made available to visa applicants who declare their relatives at the time of the initial visa application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy supports Australia's &quot;world-leading offshore processing and illegal boat arrival turnback policies&quot; but it says that all determinations of visa applications should take place in Australia, including visa applications from &quot;identified high-risk countries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also advocates making permanent residents &quot;subject to ongoing character tests&quot; and says residency should be withdrawn in the event of significant criminal conduct, either within Australia or overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy says the residency requirement to obtain Australian citizenship should be extended to 10 years, and all applicants must have paid income tax, net of all government welfare, for at least seven of those 10 years in order for qualify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     A Galaxy poll published this week suggested Australian Conservatives is polling ahead of One Nation's result at the last federal election. That poll says Cory Bernardi's breakaway party is on 6% of the vote, compared with One Nation's 5.5% at the 2016 federal election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Nation in this week's Galaxy poll was on 12%. In the Guardian Essential poll, One Nation is on 8%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Australian Conservatives has been eyeing off various state election contests ahead of the next federal battle, the key test for Bernardi's fledgling rightwing political movement will come at the South Australian state election, which is due in March next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as positioning the party to the right of the Turnbull government on immigration, the new policy manifesto also sets out a framework on energy that lines up with some of the views expressed by dissenters inside the Coalition about climate and energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Australian Conservatives position opposes all renewable energy targets, opposes subsidies for electricity generation, and requires all power supplied to the grid to be synchronous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also advocates withdrawing from the Paris climate accord - a position which has been championed publicly by the chairman of the Coalition's backbench committee on climate and energy, Craig Kelly, and by the LNP backbencher George Christensen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next major battle inside the Coalition is on energy policy. The government is yet to decide whether it will implement the central recommendation of the Finkel review of the national electricity market - a clean energy target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With voter anger about political entitlements and the donations system red-hot, the new policy manifesto also takes up the theme of integrity in politics, with a section called &quot;Bursting the Canberra Bubble&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian Conservatives proposes restricting access to parliamentary benefits, and reforming the donations laws to ensure that donations to political parties, candidates and associated political entities can only be made by individuals, and capped at an annual amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donations must also be disclosed in real time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy also advocates that all publicly funded expenditure incurred in supporting a parliamentarian should be made publicly available in real time, and a searchable public database of public spending should be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manifesto proposes term limits for all politicians &quot;and restoring the principle role of the Senate as the states' house&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australian Conservatives support Senate reform including: having senators sit in state instead of party blocks, having no senators form part of executive government and constitutional reform to resolve deadlocks without recourse to a double dissolution election,&quot; the policy says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party also supports a pay freeze for politicians and public servants - an idea likely to win public support.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two boys, aged nine and ten, waved goodbye to their parents and left for school in their village in Myanmar's Rakhine State on August 28.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was like any other Monday for the brothers, called Hussain and Mufisa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when they returned later that day, their childhood home was in flames and their parents - Rohingya Muslims - were nowhere to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They followed their neighbours into the nearby forest, where they were told their parents had been killed by the Myanmar army in an attack on the village of Chin Khali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are very sad without our parents and feel very lonely,' Hussain said, with a vacant expression, in the Kutupalong camp across the border in Bangladesh. Beside him stood his brother, his bare arms folded defensively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With their home torched and parents dead, the two brothers were forced to flee with the other villagers, carrying nothing but their schoolbooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After five days walking over jungled hills and across rivers the boys arrived in Bangladesh where they were abandoned by their neighbours and left to sleep on the side of the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are not the only children to have been orphaned or separated from their families in the explosion of violence in Myanmar's western Rakhine State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 400,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled a Myanmar military offensive that began after a series of guerrilla attacks on August 25 on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine have been torched but authorities in Buddhist-majority Myanmar have denied that security forces or Buddhist civilians set the fires. They blame the insurgents, and say 30,000 non-Muslim villagers were also displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, has so far identified 1,312 unaccompanied or separated Rohingya children among the latest arrivals in Bangladesh - a number they fear will increase over the coming days, Jean Lieby, head of child protection at UNICEF Bangladesh, said by phone on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF estimates that an 'unprecedented' 60 percent of new refugees in Bangladesh are children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are particularly concerned about the separated children,' Jean-Jacques Simon at UNICEF South Asia told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 'Trafficking, child labour, exploitation - you name it, these children are vulnerable.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the sprawling refugee camps that have sprung up along Bangladesh's southern frontier, UNICEF has set up tented spaces for the children to play safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But along the roadsides or among the muddy lanes of these squalid camps, thousands of Rohingya children beg for food or money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh was recently downgraded to a Tier 2 'Watch List' country in the US State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report, reflecting increased concerns about government efforts to combat trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report expressed particular concern for country's Rohingya population arguing their 'stateless status and inability to receive aid and work legally increases their vulnerability to human trafficking.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have already heard that there is the recruitment of children for exploitative domestic servitude jobs within the refugee camps' said UNICEF's Lieby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early marriage was also a risk for Rohingya refugee girls, whose families have too many mouths to feed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, a UN survey found that over half of Rohingya girls who fled to Malaysia, India and Indonesia became child brides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Bangladeshi camp, 10-year-old Noor Kajol is one of those vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young girl fled northern Rakhine State after the military shot her father in the head while the two of them were brushing their teeth, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eldest of five siblings in a fatherless household, she is now particularly at risk of exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are hungry and have not had much food,' she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from her dingy shelter, deep inside what is called the new Kutupalong settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The abduction and trafficking of minors is not a new threat faced in Bangladesh, which has been hosting hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees since the 1990s. In the first half of 2017, aid group Action contre la Faim (ACF) recorded the disappearance of 16 Rohingya children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the sheer scale of the recent influx makes the new settlements fertile territory for traffickers, and it is not just the unaccompanied or separated children who are at risk, said Lieby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'New families are vulnerable because they have lost everything and they need income so they are more inclined to hand their children over to harmful entities,' he said. 'Our message is don't give your child to anyone you don't know.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussain and Mufisa are safe for now, having been taken in by fellow refugee Zafor Ahmed, a stranger who found the boys crying by the side of the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They now live in the Kutupalong camp in Zafor's family home - a precarious shelter made from two sheets of muddied tarpaulin and sticks of bamboo. At night they sleep body-to-body, a wicker mat the only barrier between them and the sodden earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I already have a family of six, so it is difficult to all live under the same tarpaulin hut,' said 45-year-old Zafor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But it is not safe for them on their own so I am happy to look after them until the government of Bangladesh or another organisation can take responsibility.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">737 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is the text of Nini Ketelauri's report in the high circulation Georgian daily newspaper Rezonansi on 17 August headlined &quot;The fate of two people, who were arrested at the request of the Turkish side, is still uncertain. 'The Turkish side has effectively failed to send in any evidence'&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fate of the Turkish businessmen, who were arrested in Georgia at the request of the Turkish side, is still uncertain. A court session on the extradition of [the manager of Demirel School in Tbilisi] Mustafa Emre Cabuk is to be held before 25 August. As for the request of [the extradition of] Sinan Sarac, the Turkish side has not submitted it yet due to the lack of evidence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For reference, on 24 May, Mustafa Emre Cabuk was arrested at the request of the Turkish side. He is one of the managers and a teacher of Demirel School, which is associated with [Turkish preacher and public figure] Fethullah Gulen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Cabuk's] lawyers say that the charge against their client is quite vague, that he was arrested on political grounds, and that he has never helped any terrorist organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for businessman Sinan Sarac, he was arrested by the Georgian Central Criminal Police Search Service on 21 April. According to the lawyer of the arrested, Merab Mamuladze, he is charged with membership of an armed formation. However, he has no criminal record, never mind being on the Interpol wanted list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also says that the businessman has been in Georgia since 2016. Before being arrested, he did business in Turkey. He is also a member of a financial organisation's supervisory board and also a member of an education institution's management board, which proved to be the reason for his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, both of the arrested applied for asylum to the Georgian Ministry for Internally Displaced Persons [from the Occupied Territories], Accommodation [and Refugees], but were refused. As the lawyers put it, in their home county, they are sure to face the danger of torture and inhuman treatment. The Georgian Ministry for Refugees does not confirm this, saying that similar facts no longer take place in Turkish prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Turkish nationals challenged the ministry's decision in the court. However, the court session on the Mustafa Emre Cabuk case has been scheduled for October and the Sinan Sarac case has not even been scheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As regards the extradition proceedings, the Emre Cabuk case is going to be considered before 25 August. However, in the case of Sinan Sarac, the case has not even begun, as the Turkish side has failed to send necessary evidence up to now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mustafa Emre Cabuk's lawyer Soso Baratashvili says that if needed, his client will appeal to not only all Georgian judicial instances, but also to the European Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We challenged the decision by the Ministry for Refugees and the hearing of the case was scheduled for 12 October. As regards the prolongation of the pre-extradition detention, [the hearing] will be held on 25 August,&quot; Soso Baratashvili said, emphasising that if the court was fair, it should take a decision in Mustafa Emre Cabuk's favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the court is just a little fair, no extradition should take place, of course. If the court decides to give him the status of refugee, the extradition proceedings will be halted. Otherwise, we will challenge the decision at the appeal court. If they fail to satisfy our request, the process of gaining refugee status will be considered as completed and extradition proceedings will be continued. However, if the court decides to allow the Justice Ministry to issue an extradition order, we will also challenge this in two [judicial] instances and the European Court of Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sinan Sarac's lawyer Merab Mamuladze, the court has registered their petition for the status of refugee, but the court session has not been scheduled yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As regards the extradition, the procedures are still under way. The period of his pre-extradition detention was prolonged. The Turkish side has effectively failed to send in any evidence. It has at least not appealed to the court with the request to hand him over. At this stage, only the Prosecutor's Office is collecting evidence. Consequently, we are waiting for the proceedings to be scheduled by both sides,&quot; Merab Mamuladze said. Similar to Emre Cabuk's lawyer, he is going to appeal to all court instances, including the European Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Mahama Refugee Camp in southeastern Rwanda, one of cricket's universal truths is being played out by a group of very enthusiastic Burundian children: it is a batsman's game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow Mary Maina, the captain of the Rwandan women's team, is bringing order to a one-hour cricket class given to a group of around 200 children who have never clapped eyes on the game before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has pegged out four small cones and placed a plastic ball on top of each one. One group are queuing up to give them a whack. About 50 metres away the others are lining up in a row behind a set of different cones, which she tells them is &quot;the boundary&quot;, and they are &quot;fielders&quot;. When she shouts &quot;one, two, three, go&quot; the batsman swings and all hell breaks loose as about 120 kids scrabble around in the dust trying to grab the balls, while the batsman runs around two sets of stumps like a baseball player going around base.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is how you deliver cricket in a United Nations refugee camp home to 55,000 people of whom 51 per cent are children. The camp sits on the banks of the Akagera River on the border with Tanzania and in two years its population has grown from 8,000 as families flee the political instability of Burundi to find refuge in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is here Mary is spreading the word of cricket for, as a Rwandan player, she knows the significance of introducing it to refugees. It was Rwandan refugees returning home after the genocide 23 years ago who brought cricket with them after seeing it in similar camps in British-influenced Uganda and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is about humanity and the right thing to do. If I was in their shoes what would I want?,&quot; Mary says. &quot;I would want exactly what we are doing, showing them there is hope because we know what happened to us. There was hope then, and now look at us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we were talking, at the new cricket stadium in Kigali they were clearing up the mud caused by a sudden storm on Wednesday and tending the pitch, the first grass wicket in Rwanda, in preparation for yesterday's opening ceremony, a momentous day for Rwandan cricket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manicured outfield, tiled pavilion and pristine net facilities in Kigali feel further away from Mahama than the three hours on tarmacked road, and another hour on a rutted dirt track, that separates the camp and the country's thriving capital city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this project at Mahama is the next step for the Rwandan Cricket Stadium Foundation that raised the &pound;1million to build the ground. From today, the charity morphs into Cricket Builds Hope, using the new Gahanga Cricket Ground as a resource centre for delivering social programmes, with a particular focus on female empowerment. The refugee camp trip is a glimpse of the future when the charity hopes to stretch beyond Kigali, using cricket as a vehicle for social change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mahama they know the value of sport, even one as alien to Burundians as cricket. Mostly the children play football, making balls out of rags bound together with string around an inflated condom. One day they would love to have a cricket field, more likely an artificial pitch (water is needed for better uses in a refugee camp than grass), so the work Mary did on Thursday could become a regular fixture of camp life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The purpose of sports is security, and when they play they forget trauma, self-pity and all other kinds of problems that refugees have,&quot; says Joseph Kamuzinzi, the camp's protection assistant in charge of youth and sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary's infectious enthusiasm connects with the children and turns what could be chaos into a fun, controlled session. There is no real attempt to coach cricket. Just hit the ball and smile. &quot;It is step by step,&quot; she says. &quot;The fun bit first - it helps you mobilise the kids so they want to come next time. Then you add skills one by one, and then hopefully a cricketer is born. With these children it is about how to get through to them. They need to feel you are a friend. That is the logic I used today. Let's get kaddish together, enjoy this together and get crazy together. After that it was easy to coordinate. But as you saw, everyone always wants to bat and hit the ball as far as they can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 13-year-old boy called Charles, who has lived in the camp for two years, agrees. He had never seen cricket before. &quot;It is easy, you just hit the ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has not been easy to reach this stage. It took five years to raise &pound;1million to build the cricket ground in Kigali and lay the foundations for projects such as the one in Mahama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now that the ground is in full use, Cricket Builds Hope can move forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ally Shale, the 27-year-old British project coordinator, has delivered the ground first envisaged by his late father, Christopher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shale is about to move on, and hands over tomorrow to a new coordinator in Geordie Morrison, whose job it will be to ensure there is funding to maintain the ground, at around &pound;50,000 per year, and build the social programmes liaising with Cricket Without Boundaries, a charity that has experience of similar work in Rwanda and elsewhere in Africa. The Lord's Taverners have donated 1,000 items of kit to help with the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary, as an ambassador, will be at the centre of the campaigns, along with another female player, Cathia Uwamahoro. They will deliver educational and vocational programmes through cricket. &quot;Our initial focus will be on disadvantaged women and girls aged 16-25,&quot; says Morrison. &quot;We are going to be running leadership programmes from the stadium with a partner called Resonate, who use storytelling methods to help women build confidence and skills. Our first focus is on 450 women in Gahanga and all being well those programmes should be up and running in 2018 with sufficient fundraising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mary and Cathia the charity already has two women who have built their own stories to change their lives. Cathia was introduced to cricket by Eric Dusingizimana, the captain of the Rwanda team, after she saw him holding a coaching demonstration. Mary stumbled across it, too. &quot;Best accident that ever happened in my life,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cathia is now a Guinness World Record holder for batting in the nets longer than any other female player, which led to her being offered a job with one of Rwanda's leading financial companies, and Mary has become an accomplished media performer while finishing her university studies in biotechnology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had girls on the back pages of sports papers, which you do not see with other sports in Rwanda,&quot; says Shale. &quot;We have challenges in our society,&quot; says Mary as we speak on the bus home from the refugee camp. &quot;It is men-dominated, and sport is totally men-dominated, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seeing that a girl in our society can stand up in a community of men and feel my ideas matter is a big thing. Cricket has given us that environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free HIV testing and educational workshops will be held at the ground and Cathia explains how she uses cricket in that setting. &quot;I say consider the stumps as your life, the bat is your condom and the ball is Aids. You use the bat to defend the stumps from the ball so you have to protect yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan men's team plays in Africa Division Three; the women have been playing seriously only for five years but now they have proper facilities the hope is the game will boom. &quot;We had nothing, but now everyone is like, 'I need to train because I have to play at that ground,'&quot; says Mary. &quot;We watched a lot of the women's World Cup. Our ground is the same as the ones they played on. When you have a good ground what is left? It is the players. We need to be in the nets more to play the standard of cricket we watch on TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shale will be a trustee of Cricket Builds Hope and believes the ground is just the beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One hundred per cent this can grow outside Rwanda. We need proof of our programmes being successful over a year to 18 months first,&quot; he said. &quot;There are ideas of trying to help terrorists who have been incarcerated but are now trying to be reintroduced in society, and using cricket as a vehicle to do that. I think there is no limit to the power of this game if it is used in a very sensible and strategic way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Final word to Mary. &quot;One girl in my team was denied the right to a family due to the genocide in our country. She lost her parents and grew up in a home. It was only when she joined our team that she felt she had a family experience. She has grown from being that reserved person who always felt as if she did not matter in society to someone who leads her friends at school. Seeing that transition makes you understand how cricket helps people's lives around here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think there is no limit to the power of this game if it is used in a very sensible and strategic way'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If I was in their shoes what would I want? I would want exactly what we're doing'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">We can criticise Australia's policy of detaining refugees on Pacific islands - but the UK is no better; <BR>If we started to apply ethical rationale to all our potential holiday destinations, where could we visit with a clear conscience?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janet Street-Porter</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICES; Version:2</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">914 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the holiday season, but here's a modern dilemma - should our choice of destination be informed by local politics? These days, we're encouraged to travel ethically - offsetting plane travel and fuel consumption, spending our cash supporting local businesses, and blending in with the customs and culture. Now, should we add another choice to that ethical list - is it acceptable to holiday in places that tolerate human rights abuses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar, for example, and Saudi Arabia - but what about Australia? Aussies are famous for their hospitality, so - while visiting friends in northern New South Wales - I was surprised to read the following message in the local paper:&quot;If you are on holiday here please don't come again - because some people can't leave.&quot; The ad highlighted the plight of the hundreds of detainees currently held against their will on Nauru and the Papua New Guinea Island of Manus. The Australian government, determined to stem the flow of asylum seekers arriving by boat, is refusing to allow them to enter the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been as many as 2,000 people detained in camps on the two islands, with currently around 650 left, refused entry to Australia and fearful for their lives if they return home. Recently, New Zealand offered a home to 150 of them, but - outrageously - the Australian government spurned the offer, claiming it would only encourage more boat people to come. President Obama offered to allow several hundreds to enter the US, and although Trump tried to renege on the deal, he has grudgingly accepted less than 100 in total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad telling me to go home has a point - the treatment of these refugees is shocking, and conditions in Manus and on Nauru leave a lot to be desired, with allegations of sexual assault, brutality and self-harming. There is a lack of a long-term plan from the authorities, in spite of a high-profile campaign on social media titled #LetThemStay, with prominent Australians such asRussell Crowe describing the camps as &quot;a nation's shame&quot;. The government's &quot;Pacific Solution&quot; was devised in desperation, and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has done nothing to bring it to a humane conclusion, using vital foreign aid to Papua New Guinea and Nauru to bribe those regimes into continuing to host the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the detainees have been in this limbo land for five years, but just as Australia took forever to approve of gay marriage, so it seems to be just as reluctant to grant fellow humans some rights in this vast country full of empty space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, tourism is important to the New South Wales economy, particularly along the coastal areas, but foreigners are in the minority. And if we started to apply this kind of rationale to all our potential holiday destinations, where could we visit with a clear conscience?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee explains what it's like sleeping rough in Calais</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the UK, for example. According to the Refugee Council, in the year to June, 27,819 asylum seekers and refugees were held in detention centres in the UK. According to official figures, more thanhalf are held for less than two months, and only 1 per cent for over a year - but that is more than270 people. In spite of saying children would no longer be locked up, 48 were held during this time - and conditions in our detention centres remain a cause for concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, a </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panorama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> highlighted the brutality and shoddy treatment of detainees at Brook House, near Gatwick Airport, which contains people refused asylum, foreign nationals who have completed jail sentences, and visa overstays - all people the Home Office wants to dump somewhere else, just like the people on Manus and Nauru. After the BBC programme, nine officers were suspended and an inquiry is underway. There have been allegations of sexual assaults at Yarls Wood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Brexit, the way that the UK treats refugees and asylum seekers will be part of our national identity. Having sat through the harrowing scenes in the award-winning BBC series </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exodus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, I do not want my country to be blighted in the same way that Australia's image has been tarnished by Manus and Nauru. The second series of the programme followed dozens of refugees slowly attempting to make their way across Europe to a new life. They were articulate and dignified, as they trudged for hundreds of miles, encountering barbed wire, packs of ferocious dogsand hostility -scraping together makeshift shelters out of rubbish and donations. Their positivity in the face of rejection was utterly moving.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why asylum-seekers in Italy are fed up with their food rations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every day, dozens of desperate people arrive in the UK, stowed in cars and trucks. Children routinely escape from processing centres, sought out by trafficking gangs. The UK has no time limit for someone held in detention, and has the lowest rate of asylum approvals in the Big FiveEU nations (Italy, France, Spain and Germany). Asylum seekers are only allowed to work after they have been waiting to hear about their status for 12 months, and many exist on just &pound;5 a day. Isn't it about time that we asked some tough questions about the treatment of detainees in the UK? The Germans and French have a far better track record than we do - when it comes to ethical tourism, Britain isn't necessarily a great choice of destination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demolition of the Manus Island detention centre must stop immediately, lawyers for the detainees have told Papua New Guinea's supreme court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work to dismantle to centre, including the shutdown of power and water, breached the constitutional rights of refugees and asylum seekers, the court heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Lomai, a PNG lawyer running a compensation case on behalf of detainees, told Guardian Australia they should be allowed to live in the centre freely, and that he had requested a halt on all work until 31 October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told the court my clients are being traumatised with the current actions by the PNG and Australian governments trying to close the centre by the 31st of October,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australian government pays heavy penalty for Manus mistreatment | Richard Ackland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also disrupt the power supply and the water ... and it has now forced them to reside in conditions which are inhumane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I asked that they should be able to give us the undertaking that they will not dismantle the centre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lomai did not make a formal application for an injunction during the hearing - which was called to seek an adjournment on the compensation case - but asked the immigration department to halt the dismantling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer for the immigration department, Robert Bradshaw, told Guardian Australia he had put the request to his client for consideration and was awaiting instruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month authorities began closing down the centre with refugees and asylum seekers still inside. They were told blocks would be systematically shut and all amenities removed, and that people could move to another section or take up residence in the East Lorengau transit facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Detainees were threatened with arrest and informed any non-compliance could jeopardise their chances with US authorities under a deal for the country to resettle up to 1,200 people. Those with negative refugee determinations were told to return home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Escalating protests against the closures have been met with increased security at the centre, as detainees say they will refuse to move into the Lorengau transit centre and community, citing safety fears  after a number of violent attacks on refugees. Tensions have continued to rise over a number of issues, including alleged assaults on locals by detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian and PNG governments have said the centre will be closed in line with the supreme court's ruling that the detention of refugees and asylum seekers was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lomai said that ruling never declared the centre must be entirely shut down, and said Justice Higgins made similar remarks in court on Monday: that the ruling called only for the detainees to be allowed to live freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moves to &quot;open&quot; the centre were inadequate, he suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They still treat them like prisoners, they still have to sign in and sign out,&quot; he said. &quot;Strictly speaking their constitutional rights continue to be breached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  What we've learned from the Trump-Turnbull call transcript</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Barns, spokesman for the Australian Lawyers Alliance, said the human rights of asylum seekers were more strongly protected by the PNG constitution than by the Australian one, and that the supreme court ruling called for the centre not to be used like a jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite the fact the Australian government would have us believe it complied with the court's orders to open up the centre, the reality is that in practical terms, no asylum seeker is safe outside of that compound because the Australian government has refused to allow any of these men to come to Australia or to go to New Zealand and has refused to provide protection for them within PNG.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The compensation case has been adjourned until the end of the month. Lomai said he had been waiting to see the final outcome of the class action in Melbourne which resulted in the Australian government agreeing to pay $70m in compensation to 1,905 men it held there for their illegal detention, and for physical and psychological harm caused by the illegal detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month a letter signed by some of the 806 men on Manus Island gave Australian officials the same 159-day &quot;countdown&quot; as the centre's closure to &quot;find a safe country for us and send us out of this country directly from this detention prison, or we are not moving anywhere&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week we, together with colleagues from across the parties, tabled an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This amendment&nbsp;will ensure Britain remains a positive force in the world and able to help the most vulnerable children, fleeing war and danger, get to the safety of their families in the UK, an issue we saw first-hand with Unicef UK this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We both took different views on the referendum that led to this Bill but we are in complete agreement that the future of Britain in or out of Europe must be one in which we can do the right thing for children swept up in the global refugee crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to its need to be a two-way agreement, the 'Dublin' system for refugee family reunion will not be preserved in the current Bill despite its intention to keep all European regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside of Dublin, the UK's own refugee family reunion rules currently don't recognise any other concept of family beyond parents - grandparents, elder siblings, uncles, aunts, are all, absurdly, not family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We think most sensible people would recognise a big sister as family, especially if in doing so it would get a child to safety and out of danger. However, without the Dublin scheme only our domestic system will operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   FAQ | Dublin Regulation                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For children who have lost their parents and their home, their surviving close family is the best hope for a future they have and we can't allow for them to lose this chance. Our amendment would fix our rules in this way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proper response to the migration crisis needs to be systematic and sustainable and the family reunion system is an important part of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the UK's foreign policy, development and aid is critical in ensuring that these children do not have a situation they need to flee home in the first place, we still have a role to play in ensuring legal routes exist for those children for whom it is in their best interest to come to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too often, the reality is that refugee children have found the only way they can get across Europe is with criminals who have far from charitable interests in them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children who have fled war in Syria or escaped being forced to be child soldiers in Eritrea need help and safety but instead only find delays and bureaucracy in the official system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee camp in the Bekaa Valley, LebanonCredit:      Andrew Parsons / i-Images     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need the rule of law to be more effective than any criminal network. That is why we cannot afford to lose this safe and legal route and that is why we have tabled our amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We saw first-hand the reality of why this is needed earlier in the year when we visited Greece with Unicef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An overwhelmed Greek civil service were unable to co-operate with the Dubs scheme the UK government had put in place - their limited resources meant Greek officials could not justify putting specialists on a small one-off scheme with limited numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They need a system that will last if they are going to justify supporting it. The result is that the UK has not seen anywhere near the number of transfers they expected by this time of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope the Secretary of State accepts the logic of this amendment. Certainly David Davis has already acknowledged the problem of Dublin ending when it was raised in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Number of refugees taken in under 2015 EU immigration scheme</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He even said how he hopes to fix it in a way that grows the British tradition of tolerance and generosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This amendment is an opportunity for the Government to do just that and ensure we live up to our credentials as a truly Global Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently children are forced to make a dangerous journey into Europe before they can start the family reunion process - this would not be the case if the reunion process occurred under our own rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the change in our amendment would mark a bad day indeed for the traffickers of children.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This amendment sends a clear signal as to what a truly Global Britain means for the future - a tolerant, compassionate and strong nation, proudly in the world and we call on colleagues to support us.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Turnbull government has briefly lost control of the lower house, losing a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the chamber passing a motion calling for asylum seekers on Manus Island to be sent to New Zealand. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens motion, calling on the government to accept New Zealand's offer to resettle 150 refugees and negotiate conditions similar to the US refugee resettlement agreement, initially passed the house 73 votes to 72 in an upset vote late on Monday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Government loses vote on New Zealand refugee offer - as it happened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberal MP Warren Entsch missed the division because he was being interviewed on television, as did the frontbencher Steve Ciobo, who later told the house he was &quot;unfortunately detained&quot; - an explanation that prompted howls of derision from across the chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manager of government business, Christopher Pyne, scrambled shortly after the defeat to recommit the vote, ignoring voluble protests from the Labor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, declared the vote had been lost because &quot;[government MPs] can't turn up for work&quot;. Burke said the vote had been entirely anticipated so there could be no valid claims of misadventure requiring a rerun of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the missing MPs returned to the chamber, the government was able to force a rerun and it eventually won the division, successfully seeing off the Greens motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motion, which had passed the Senate, was always going to be a close-run vote, because it had the support of the ALP and all of the lower house crossbenchers, apart from Queensland's Bob Katter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the chamber descended into a procedural skirmish before the vote was recommitted, the journalist Behrouz Boochani, who is one of the refugees on Manus Island, took to Twitter to express hope that Australia could ultimately turn to New Zealand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Australia accepts sending people to New Zealand it will be a big step forward for a humane solution. We people in Manus dont want anything from Australia. Just let us go. For a long time we haven't wanted anything from Australia. #Manus - Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) December 4, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens lower house MP Adam Bandt also took to Twitter to declare supporters of the men on Manus would keep fighting to try to secure a transfer to New Zealand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sadly, after pulling a procedural trick, gov just defeated - by one vote - Parl's push to get gov to accept the NZ refugee deal. We will keep fighting to stop this gov's crimes on Manus. The people are speaking and their voice is getting louder. Evacuate Manus now.- Adam Bandt ?????? (@AdamBandt) December 4, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government enters the final sitting week for 2017 vulnerable because it is down two MPs in the lower house. The Liberal John Alexander is fighting to hold his seat of Bennelong at a byelection, and the National Barnaby Joyce prevailed in the New England byelection at the weekend but is not yet back in the chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lost vote on Monday afternoon followed separate disruption to government business in the Senate, with the government pulling superannuation legislation and reordering business because it lacked the numbers to steer the bill through the chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government was, however, spared one embarrassment, with a decision by the outspoken Queensland MP George Christensen to backflip on an earlier suggestion he could go against government policy and support amended legislation restoring lost penalty rates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By BBC Monitoring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media in Bangladesh continue to put the spotlight on the humanitarian crisis facing the Rohingya refugees who are pouring into Bangladesh following an army crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement at the UN general Assembly yesterday, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued a new call for Myanmar to take back the refugees and urged for greater international pressure on Myanmar over the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi is facing growing international criticism after a speech yesterday in which she failed to address allegations of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; against Rohingyas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several newspapers in their editorials and commentaries, besides TV shows focused on the issue, particularly the need for diplomatic international pressure on Myanmar to take back more than 400,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Major impact&quot; on Bangladesh resources</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the media in Bangladesh lauded Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her government's humanitarian efforts in providing shelter to the Rohingya refugees, concerns were also raised over the socio-economic impact on the country's resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A commentary by columnist Selim Sher in English-language portal bdnews24.com on 17 September cautions that &quot;this mass influx will have a major political, social and economic impact on a small nation like Bangladesh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pitfalls for Bangladesh are immense... It will not only impact the social and political fabric of the country, but will also turn back the economic development we achieved in the last decade,&quot; he notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, Bengali daily Prothom Alo in its 18 September editorial said that it was &quot;difficult to sustain this stand in a country under constant pressure of a burgeoning population and unemployment... Attention must be paid to the matter from the very beginning or else things will spiral out of control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing the sentiment, another Bengali paper Dainik Janakantha on the same day said that with Bangladesh's &quot;limited ability, it is difficult for the country to continue to support them for a long time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, former ambassador AH Mofazzal Karim, in a show on Bengali Independent TV channel on 17 September voiced concern over the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot bear the burden of hundreds of thousands refugee for a long time. If these refugees have to stay in Bangladesh for a longer period of time, the Rohingya population will definitely become a risk for Bangladesh,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security analyst Abdur Rashid in a talk show on Bengali channel Bangla Vision TV on 16 September also warned about the security risk for Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our local terrorist groups will definitely try to radicalise these persecuted people. So the administration and law enforcement agencies must be vigilant to protect these refugees from being radicalised,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticising Myanmar's &quot;icon of liberty and freedom&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several media outlets in Bangladesh criticised Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, for her failure to address allegations of ethnic cleansing against Rohingyas in her speech yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abul Hasan Chowdhury in a talk show on Channel-i Television on 17 September said that &quot;even after her democratic role and bravery, Suu Kyi has become the poster girl of barbarism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another columnist C.R. Abrar in a commentary in The Daily Star on 19 September said that &quot;commentators, campaigners, politicians, Nobel laureates... in many parts of the world have been stunned by the stance taken by the unofficial head of the Burmese [Myanmar] government, Aung San Suu Kyi, the icon of liberty and freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An editorial in Prothom Alo on 20 September noted that the Myanmar leader's &quot;attitude has disappointed us&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columnist Jahanara Bithi in a commentary in Bengali daily Dainik Ittefaq on 16 September said that &quot;Myanmar government should be forced to come to a permanent solution... They [Rohingyas] have the right to live in their country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, an editorial in The Daily Star on 19 September said that &quot;it is unfortunate that instead of taking any substantive steps, the world body relies on a misguided belief that Suu Kyi will eventually respond to her conscience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Need for &quot;diplomatic offensive&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media also called upon the international community to force Myanmar to pay heed to the massive influx of refugees from Rakhine, and urged Bangladesh to go on a diplomatic offensive over the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a commentary in The Daily Star on 18 September, columnists Inam Ahmed and Shakhawat Liton noted that &quot;before Bangladesh, there remains only one option open - to go all out on a diplomatic offensive to force Myanmar to take back its citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In its armoury, Bangladesh has a lot of weapons to launch diplomatic offensive... All it needs is to use the diplomatic armoury and pursue its friends to stand beside humanity,&quot; they added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, an editorial in independent English-language daily The New Nation on 16 September urged Bangladesh government &quot;to stand on its own and show guts and courage against brutalities of Myanmar army. Bangladesh must tell the world that no diplomatic solution without threat of military action will have a chance to succeed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columnist Selim Sher in a commentary in bdnews24.com on 17 September said that &quot;our diplomatic efforts have to be swift and efficient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing the sentiment, Jugantor in its 16 September editorial said &quot;the diplomatic capability of the country needs to be increased in this regard...the world conscience needs to be revived against this anti-humanitarian force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, security analyst Abdur Rashid on Bangla Vision TV on 16 September felt that &quot;many people are arguing in favour of getting involved in a direct conflict with Burma. But these issues need to be handled diplomatically.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WikiLeaks publishes Macron campaign emails</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WikiLeaks yesterday published a searchable archive of what it said were more than 21,000 verified emails associated with key figures in the election campaign of French President Emmanuel Macron. The stolen data was originally dumped on the internet in May, on the eve of the run-off between Mr Macron and his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen. Within hours of the leak, Mr Macron's staff had said it had been targeted by a &quot;massive and coordinated&quot; hacking operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Republic on the Move party yesterday said the mails seemed to be the same as the ones leaked on 5 May and warned that fake documents were mixed with authentic ones. &quot;Republic on the Move calls for vigilance over these publications,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;Under the guise of novelty, WikiLeaks is taking over as its own the destabilisation operation from May.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document dump came too late in the campaign to have any direct influence on the election, in part because the electoral commission warned it was a crime to republish any details from the emails before the vote. French newspapers which have pored over the documents since then said they found nothing scandalous to report. By turning the dump into a database, WikiLeaks has made the documents easily searchable for any internet user.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WikiLeaks said it was publishing the leaks now after verifying the authenticity of the email addresses.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clooneys to help 3,000 Syrian refugees go to school</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George and Amal Clooney said yesterday they would help 3,000 Syrian refugee children go to school this year in Lebanon, where the UN says 200,000 children are not receiving an education after fleeing the war in neighboring Syria. The Clooney Foundation for Justice said it has teamed up with Google and HP Inc to help the UN children's agency Unicef and the Lebanese Ministry of Education to open seven so-called &quot;second shift&quot; schools for Syrian refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon has more than 1 million Syrian refugees, including nearly 500,000 children. It is educating Syrian children in public schools through a &quot;second shift&quot; system of additional afternoon classes exclusively for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want to lose an entire generation because they had the bad luck of being born in the wrong place at the wrong time,&quot; said Oscar-winning actor George Clooney and international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who gave birth to twins last month. &quot;Thousands of young Syrian refugees are at risk - the risk of never being a productive part of society,&quot; the couple said in a statement. &quot;Formal education can help change that.&quot; Reuters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isis attacks Iraqi embassy in Kabul</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A four-hour firefight at the Iqaqi embassy ended yesterday with the death of three Isis gunmen who had stormed the building. The attack followed a suicide bomber blowing himself up at the gates of the building at noon local time [1630 GMT]. Interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said that two Afghan employees of the Iraqi embassy died in the attack. Three police were injured, he added. The Isis affliate in Afghanistan said only two of its followers were involved in the attack, not four as Kabul officials said, adding to the conflicting reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Danish said that all the embassy staffers were safe but that the building had suffered extensive damage, with windows broken and several rooms badly burned. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and said it was the government's responsibility to provide protection to international missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Iraqi forces, backed by a US-led coalition, recaptured the city of Mosul from Isis earlier this month, the Iraqi embassy had called reporters to its offices in Kabul to express concerns that the local Isis affiliate might stage large-scale attacks elsewhere to draw away attention from the militant group's losses in Iraq.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 killed in central Mexico state, including police chief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten people were killed in several locations in a central Mexico state, among them a police chief in one city and four members of a family in another town, authorities said yesterday. The federal Attorney General's Office said Police Chief J Santos Juarez Rocha of the city of Celaya and one of his bodyguards were found dead yesterday morning on the outskirts of the nearby city of Salamanca. The office said its Homicide Investigation Unit and Criminal Investigation Agency would be analyzing evidence to try to determine responsibility for the double homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the nearby town of Abasolo, a couple and their two adult children were executed in their home and a fifth victim was discovered outside the house, said Laura Edith Ortega, an investigator for the Guanajuato state prosecutor's office. Two other children were present but unharmed. The bodies of two teenagers were also found in separate spots in Abasolo. Ms Ortega said an investigation was underway to determine whether the seven killings in the town were connected. The 10th homicide was reported in the city of Irapuato.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guanajuato has been plagued by increased crime recently. According to government data, the first half of 2017 saw a 20 per cent increase in killings from the same period of 2016. AP</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffickers used beatings and the threat of shooting to force more than 100 refugees, including children who could not swim, to jump into heavy seas off the coast of Yemen last week, survivors have said. At least 50 people were killed. The incident is the latest in a series in which hundreds, possibly thousands of refugees have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivors contacted in Yemen told the Guardian that crewmembers armed with AK47s told around 120 men, women and children that they would not be able to land them on beaches in Yemen and forced them to jump into the water while still at least 1km offshore at dawn on Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boat had left Bosaso, a port in Somaliland on the Gulf of Aden, around 16 hours earlier, the survivors said. Fifty-one refugees, mostly Somalis trying to reach Europe, have been confirmed dead, and the toll is expected to rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The smugglers told us it was very risky to approach the shore as Yemeni authorities had arrested smugglers there. So they told us to jump. Some people shouted and begged the smugglers to take us closer, but they refused and started beating people with sticks. They had AK47s, so everyone was afraid to argue, and people started jumping into the sea,&quot; Abdirahim Ilmi Aano, 25, a labourer in Bosasso, told the Guardian. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, very few survived. I remember some were very young and did not know how to swim, &quot; Aano said when contacted by telephone in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The  International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said its staff found the shallow graves of 29 migrants on a beach in Shabwa governorate, Yemen, during a routine patrol on the morning of Tuesday. The dead had been buried hastily by survivors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IOM estimates that around 55,000 migrants have left the Horn of Africa to come to Yemen since January. More than 30,000 of those migrants are Somalians and Ethiopians aged under 18, and a third are estimated to be female. Most are hoping to find better economic opportunities in the Gulf countries or travel on elsewhere, and are fleeing drought, war and repression in their home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, in a second incident, smugglers carrying another boatload of largely Ethiopian refugees forced 160 people into the water at gunpoint. Five bodies have been recovered so far, and around 50 are reported missing, the IOM said in a statement last week. According to the agency, the approximate average age of the passengers on the boat was 16. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, Somalia's government blamed the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen for an  attack on a boat that killed at least 42 Somali refugees off Yemen's coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the risks, Yemen remains attractive to African migrants because there is no central authority to prevent them from travelling onward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, Somalia has been hit by a drought that has displaced 500,000 people and threatens more with starvation. Attacks by the al-Qaida linked al-Shabab Islamic militant group, which controls swaths of central and southern Somalia, have also intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suban Abdinor Shukur, 22, said her 19-year-old younger brother, who hoped to find work to pay for training as a computer engineer, was among those killed on Tuesday. &quot;It's a disaster for our family. I saw him off the night he was travelling to Yemen ... My family live in poverty, so my brother wanted to help us get out of this bad life. He then said he will travel to Europe to find good job and then continue to get education and help mother back home,&quot; Shukur said, speaking on the phone from Bosaso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mumino Dhubow, mother of a 17-year-old on the same boat, said she had sold family land and borrowed money to pay for his journey. Her son called her from Bosaso to tell her he had paid $500 to a smuggler for his passage across the Gulf of Aden and would leave shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Life is hard here. There is war. People are killed every day. Al-Shabab refused to allow food aid from humanitarian agencies to reach us.  We could not cultivate our farms due to the drought. So my son was the only hope we had to survive. I have not heard from him. I am praying he will be OK,&quot; Dhubow said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 111,500 migrants arrived on Yemen's shores last year, up from around 100,000 the year before, according to the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat, a grouping of international agencies that monitors migration in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aano said he had left three children and his wife behind in central Somalian town of Beletwein, but could not return. He now plans to travel to Sudan by another unsafe, illegal sea journey and then on to Libya. The journey will cost between $5,500 to $7,000, he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon's fertile Bekaa Valley is beautiful. In the July sun, gold wheat fields reflect the light and the sky is blue and clear over the mountains which form the border with Syria. The Bekaa's lush landscape is usually at odds with the poverty found there: 39 per cent of Lebanon's registered 1.1 million refugees are living in the 2,564 informal settlements dotted across the Bekaa, according to UN data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, however, blackened fields where two refugee settlements once stood are an unmistakable reminder of the bleak situation Syrian refugees in this part of the country face.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the space of just four days, huge fires ripped through two different camps, killing two children and sending around a dozen more people to hospital with severe burns. Souriya, 40, lives in one of the settlements affected just outside the town of Qom Elias, where it is thought the blaze was started by someone using a gas canister to cook in one of the camp's 94 tents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her memory of what happened on Sunday afternoon isn't clear because everything happened so quickly, but she recalls scooping up her younger children and running for the camp's only entrance as towers of black smoke rose into the air. &quot;It was terrifying,&quot; she told The Independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While cooking fires are common in the haphazardly built settlements in which many Syrians in Lebanon are forced to live, they are normally quickly contained, affecting a tent or two before residents manage to put them out. Thanks to the searing 40 degree summer heat wave and wheat crop surrounding the camp, however, it spread very quickly. Several residents said that the fire extinguishers they used to try to put it out had expired and didn't work properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ninety-one of the camp's 94 homes were completely destroyed, leaving around 700 homeless. Almost everyone's identification papers and the few souvenirs and trinkets from home that survived the dangerous journey across the border were destroyed. &quot;We've never seen anything as severe as this. Usually fires are under control much quicker,&quot; said Antoine Ghazaly, the UN Refugee Agency's child protection officer for the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Souriya - named for her country, an old fashioned moniker which Syrians do not often give their babies these days - came to Lebanon with her husband Hamoud and their children in 2013. Natives of Raqqa, when Isis began to gain a foothold in the area they decided to get out while they still could. Now they have a family of six. Hamoud does odd jobs around the camp for cash in accordance with the strict rules set for Syrian work permits, but the family are desperately poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The usual image associated with refugees is one of camps filled with row upon row of white tents - but after taking in so many Palestinians after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and fearful of encouraging people to stay, the Lebanese have not allowed aid organisations to set up formal camps for those displaced by Syria's civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Syrian families make their own homes out of the materials to hand - with limited UN and NGO assistance - or move into derelict or abandoned buildings, often in already overcrowded Palestinian areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hope that kept Souriya going for the last few months was the promise of a new home her father was helping build for the family: a four by four metre semi-permanent house made from timberframe, breezeblocks and tarpaulin, which would have its own latrine.Like everything else at Qob Elias camp, it went up in flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While rebuilding work has already begun in earnest - every family reconstructing their own shelter with help from the local Lebanese community - it does not mitigate the sense of loss for many. Talking about the house she had dreamed about, Souriya began to cry. &quot;You can't understand what it's like,&quot; she said, her children sitting around her. &quot;Everything we had is gone, again. How many times are you supposed to start again?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mediterranean - a confluence of civilizations, cultures, religions, trade and migration - is facing multiple security challenges, such as terrorism, illicit trade in narcotics, environmental degradation and forced displacement, United Nations Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres said Friday.<BR><BR>&quot;The Mediterranean is a global junction of mutually enriching cultures, societies and economies. Yet violence and hatred are threatening that dynamism, to the detriment of the entire world,&quot; Mr. Guterres told a meeting of the UN Security Council chaired by Angelino Alfano, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Italy, which holds the 15-member body's presidency this month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Challenges facing the region include illicit trade in narcotics, weapons and petroleum products, large movements of refugees and migrants, regrettably managed by human smugglers and traffickers, and maritime piracy.<BR><BR>&quot;The Mediterranean Sea provides immense economic resources - such as hydrocarbons and fish stocks - and invaluable trade routes. However, its benefits depend on stability and cooperation,&quot; the UN chief stressed.<BR><BR>Mr. Guterres went on to highlight difficulties in various parts of the region.<BR><BR>Libya's stability is vital for the region, but after years of prolonged transition, the country's institutions are deeply divided.<BR><BR>Instability in the Sahel region has contributed to an increase in irregular migration towards Europe. [embedded content]<BR><BR>VIDEO: Addressing the UN Security Council, Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres highlights the need for global solidarity to tackle the security challenges in the Mediterranean.<BR><BR>Egypt continues to face several security challenges, including from irregular migration and from the cross-border transit of weapons and fighters along its desert borders with Libya and Sudan and in the Sinai Peninsula bordering the Gaza Strip.<BR><BR>The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da'esh) will continue to thrive unless the deep political roots of the Syrian conflict are resolved through a credible and comprehensive political process.<BR><BR>Turning to the movement of refugees and migrants, Mr. Guterres said that so far this year, at least 2,800 refugees and migrants have perished in the Mediterranean, while countless others died on their way across the Sahel desert.<BR><BR>&quot;There is a clear need to create more regular and safe ways to protect those fleeing persecution, and address the drivers of displacement. We must also address the worrisome increase in xenophobia and discrimination against refugees, migrants and minorities,&quot; the Secretary-General said, stressing the need to re-establish the integrity of the refugee protection regime on both sides of the Mediterranean. We should do our utmost to resolve the worst of the region so that it can continue to contribute its best.<BR><BR>All too often, responses to security challenges in the Mediterranean are undertaken largely or solely through traditional security arrangements or ad hoc solutions, he noted.<BR><BR>&quot;Such approaches carry the risk of prolonging unacceptable status quos or worsening situations if not backed by efforts to address the underlying root causes,&quot; he said, noting that efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development have there an important role to play.<BR><BR>The Mediterranean is a global junction of mutually enriching cultures, societies and economies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pilot project&nbsp;to trace the garment and cotton supply chains of seven Dutch brands sourcing from Turkey has been unable to guarantee their products are free from child labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project was carried out by the Fair Labour Association and the Development Workshop Cooperative &amp;ndash; a civil society organisation based in Turkey &amp;ndash;&nbsp;as&nbsp;part of the broader Dutch Working Group on Child Labour. Its research&nbsp;has highlighted poverty and low wages as the biggest drivers of child labour in Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pilot initiative involved&nbsp;C&amp;A and BSCI participants&nbsp;Coolinvestments, Du Pon &amp; De Bruin, Just Brands, PVH, Varova Fashion Holding and WE Fashion joining forces to build a supply chain mapping model that identifies suppliers and potential child labour risks within each tier of a company's garment and cotton supply chain.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project was launched because the EU is Turkey's biggest buyer of garment and textiles, and an influx of people brought into Turkey following the Syrian refugee crisis increased the risks of child labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team investigated all four tiers of the supply chain from the point of sale of the garment in the Netherlands back to the cotton farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among some of the barriers&nbsp;the investigators noted were a communications breakdown between tiers two and three, with &quot;about half&quot; the tier-two participants &quot;unwilling or unable&quot; to provide deeper supply chain contacts. Fewer formal relationships between tiers two, three and four also made it &quot;impossible for project staff to trace any cotton to its original tier-four source. On top of this, there was widespread use of subcontractors for cutting and sewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond this, the project team mentioned &quot;several children including the children of Syrian refugee families, working to harvest cotton, some as young as eight&quot; on Turkish cotton farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this level of the supply chain, low wages and poverty drive the use of child labour. Families are often paid according to the amount of cotton they harvest in total, so as many family members as possible &amp;ndash;&nbsp;including children &amp;ndash; must work together to maximise income,&quot; reads the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The research found that child labour is more likely to be found in the Sanliurfa area, not only because of the increased refugee population, but also because low levels of mechanisation require more workers. Project staff found that child labour is highest where mechanisation is lowest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the research team was able to report on working conditions through four tiers of the garment supply chain, and was able to document several instances of child labour at tier-four cotton farms, the pilot was unable to achieve one of its primary objectives &amp;ndash; that of tracing a garment sold in the Netherlands back through all supply chain tiers to the source of cotton in Turkey.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For this reason, the project cannot guarantee that any products sold by participating companies are free from child labour, nor state definitively the level of risk of child labour faced by the specific companies participating in the project,&quot; the report concludes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project team is calling on companies to organise training for staff on responsible sourcing and purchasing practices; strengthen efforts to communicate labour standards; focus on areas with high refugee concentrations and advocate for governments to improve inspection and enforcement of labour standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year the&nbsp;the Foreign Trade Association (FTA) organised an event urging the Turkish government and the clothing supply chain to work together to improve the plight of Syrian refugees working in the Turkish textile industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Laura Paterson, Press Association Scotland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donations from Scotland are playing a ``crucial'' role in helping more than half a million refugees who have fled violence in Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (Sciaf) has raised more than &pound;160,000 to give vital shelter and aid to Rohingya refugees escaping religious persecution by making the perilous journey to neighbouring Bangladesh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslim minority group is denied citizenship in Burma and report the army and Buddhist leaders are orchestrating a campaign of rape, murder and burning villages, described by the UN as ``textbook ethnic cleansing'' - accusations denied by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees said children and the elderly are being targeted in the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since escalation of violence in August, Sciaf has given &pound;100,000 to help the 646,000 new refugees through its Bangladeshi aid partner Caritas Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 60% of those in the camps are children and more than 12,000 are orphans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the donations are being used to prepare the camps for winter and tackle overcrowding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blankets, floor mats and sleeping mats are being prepared for distribution to 14,600 families and so far the charity has helped 40,044 families with food and essentials such as cooking pots, plates and utensils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shawkat Ara, whose son and parents died from hunger when fleeing to Bangladesh, gave thanks for the donations she has been given since arriving at Kutupalong camp in the south east of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 38-year-old said: ``We brought nothing from Myanmar and we received food items but no utensils. These utensils help me a lot to cook for my relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``These things are very useful to me, they are better than money.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: ``My parents died when they they were crossing the river. At that time they were very sick so had to leave them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``So now I always try to help all the old age people by giving them food and cooking for them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Scottish donations are also being used to put in drainage, create safe pathways and build new homes at the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caritas Bangladesh regional director James Gomez said a pilot project is being carried out to improve the shelters and drainage for around 200 families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the refugees were sleeping in small, poorly spaced wood and tarpaulin huts with around 10 people in each and said the organisation is ``really worried'' about the risk to life unless the action is taken to address the threat of landslides in spring rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said donors from Scotland had treated the Rohingya like ``brothers and sisters'', adding: ``For these contributions we have received we are very grateful''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sciaf director Alistair Dutton said the aid money is helping to deliver ``crucial'' supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: ``Some of the first things we've been giving out is pots and pans so that they can cook food but winter is fast coming and temperatures are set to plummet to the same kind of temperatures as we see in Glasgow at this time of year so the blankets and sleeping mats are going to be absolutely crucial if people are going to be able to sleep at all.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the Kutupalong camp, he said: ``This camp is really overcrowded, there is open sewage flowing between the huts. There really is a big job to be done here to make this place habitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The huts are on very steep hillsides and when it rains here this place is going to become treacherous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It's not safe for people to remain in these conditions for any length of time and what we now have to do is to turn this into a city of a million people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sciaf launched an appeal as soon as the scale of the crisis became apparent, and raised &pound;100,000 in days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Dutton said the generosity of the people of Scotland has been ``fantastic'' but stressed more money is desperately needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: ``We've already sent &pound;100,000 to Caritas Bangladesh this year and we will continue to work with them in the following years to make sure these people are not forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The burden of this disaster cannot be left with Bangladesh. The international community must also step up to the plate. I urge everyone to please give what you can to help the Rohingya refugees.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please donate to Sciaf's Rohingya emergency appeal at www.sciaf.org.uk or call 0141 354 5555.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago today the photograph of a lifeless little boy washed up on a Turkish beach went viral. For a moment, the indignity done to the boy and his grieving family seemed to offer hope that a prevailing political hostility to refugees fleeing to Europe would be overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Alan Kurdi became a symbol of the plight of so many others fleeing conflict and persecution in Syria and elsewhere. His tragic death laid bare the consequences of governments' refusal to provide the safe routes they and their families need to reach a place where they can rebuild shattered lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron, then Prime Minister, declared how deeply moved he was by the dead boy's image. He quickly announced a substantial expansion of what had been a tiny UK resettlement programme for Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But hope faded fast. Theresa May, as Home Secretary, spoke at the Conservative Party conference barely a month later. She vowed to reduce the number of people reaching the UK to seek asylum, and to be even less tolerant of those who did. &quot;Not in a thousand years&quot; would the UK join Europe in a common approach, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footage reportedly shows young Syrian refugees being beaten by Turkish soldiers at border</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Leadership&quot; of this kind on this issue was not new from the then Home Secretary. Needless to say, it did nothing to help secure collective commitment across Europe to respect the right to asylum of people forced to seek safety by crossing the sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, various countries rushed to build more walls, fences and other less tangible barriers, from which smugglers and corrupt officials continued to profit by exploiting those needing to get past. And in spring 2016, with the EU Turkey deal, European countries agreed to pay Turkey to take back people who crossed to Greece while preventing others from making the journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This agreement has been celebrated by politicians and political commentators across Europe, including in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, since the deal tens of thousands of women, men and children have been trapped in limbo in Greece. Turkey has descended rapidly into authoritarianism with an increasing risk that many of its citizens will need to flee the country. And other countries have followed Europe in excluding and evicting refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the political soundbites about how UK Government policy has been to keep refugees &quot;safe in the region&quot;, the reality is that Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan have each been forcing Syrians back to conflict and terror while preventing others from escaping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it doesn't end there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her 2015 party conference speech, our current Prime Minister looked back to when - as she somewhat modestly put it - &quot;despite its many flaws and its criminal leadership, Libya was known as Europe's forward border&quot;. The nostalgia for a time, in which British officials could work with a repressive Libyan regime to prevent people fleeing war and poverty from reaching Europe, was palpable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Government, like others in Europe, is once again dealing with Libya to try to block migration. But there is no Libyan regime now. Rather there are disparate parties, tribes and militias vying for power, legitimacy and money. In this chaos, migrants are especially vulnerable to exploitation - whether they came to Libya to work or already hoping to reach Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slavery, kidnapping for ransom, torture and rape are just some of the myriad abuses and atrocities refugees and other migrants suffer in Libya. Whether held in official detention centres or by gangs and militias, they are at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As highlighted by Amnesty's recent report &quot;Europe: A perfect storm&quot;, supporting corrupt bodies in Libya such as the coastguard exposes people to these horrors. As European governments' assistance grows in trapping or returning people to Libya, they too will be complicit in human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those vying for power - whether to run the country or control a neighbourhood - now see the chance of securing European money by promising to curb migration to Europe. While the cash flows, they may be content to shut down smuggling routes. If it dries up, they can reopen those routes - whatever pays best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why would they ever completely close these routes? Simply ending migration would remove their hold over those governments willing to pay or provide political backing. Meanwhile, there are other opportunities to exploit people who need to get out of Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years on from a moment when public and politicians cried &quot;never again&quot;, it is all too clear that our political leaders have not set out to end the death and suffering of people forced to flee,nor their mistreatment at the hands of armed gangs and corrupt officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, our leaders seem determined merely to keep as far away as possible the death and suffering of the children, women and menwho - just like Alan Kurdi-have only smugglers and other abusers to turn to in their desperate search for safety. Out of sight, out of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deals that may temporarily slow migration at the cost of prolonging violence and suffering or exacerbating the root causes of why people need to flee are cruel and shortsighted. Governments must prioritise saving lives by maintaining search and rescue at sea while extending resettlement, family reunion and other visas for refugees to reach safety. Over the longer term, they must address those root causes - conflict, repression and global inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty is urging the public to sign a petition reminding European governments that saving lives at sea and offering protection and assistance is our moral and legal duty. You can find the petition </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malcolm Turnbull has dismissed the fears of refugees who are too scared to leave Australia's now-abandoned detention centre in Papua New Guinea, instead claiming they are being encouraged to stay there by refugee advocates and the Greens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also rejected New Zealand's offer to take 150 refugees off Australia's hands, saying he would like the Australia-United States resettlement deal to be exhausted before considering that option.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said one of the main reasons why New Zealand had the capacity to make that offer was because it had been a &quot;prime beneficiary&quot; of Australia's strong border protection policies which had stopped asylum seekers entering New Zealand waters in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus refugee who reached Canada last week says deaths are 'very likely'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know we have intercepted and turned back boats which were heading to New Zealand?&quot; Turnbull said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only reason New Zealand does not have thousands of people arriving in an unauthorised way on their shores is because of our border protection policies. New Zealand is a prime beneficiary from our strong border protection policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull was speaking on the ABC's Radio National program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was asked about the hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers who have barricaded themselves inside PNG's Manus Island detention centre, which was closed last Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electricity was shut off to the final compounds last Wednesday morning, more than 12 hours after the scheduled 5pm shutdown, and the generator was removed. Food, water and other essential services had already been stopped, and all staff left early on Tuesday last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The asylum seekers still living in the compound have pleaded for Australia to come to their aid, saying their are too scared to leave the compound to seek alternative accommodation in the main township out of fear they will be attacked by locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull was asked if he accepted the proposition that they were scared to leave, and he dismissed the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the reality is, and this is the very sad reality, there are some activists in Australia, including the Greens senator Nick McKim, who are basically encouraging these people not to move,&quot; Turnbull said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The breath of death on Manus Island: starvation and sickness | Behrouz Boochani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that the responsible course of action is to encourage them to comply with the lawful requests and requirements of the PNG authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said last week three alternative locations for the detainees were much better facilities than the now-closed centre. He also claimed activists were telling the asylum seekers to remain in the mothballed compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The advocates who are here telling them not to move, they are not doing those people any favours,&quot; Dutton told the Nine Network on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull said if Australia accepted New Zealand's offer to resettle 150 asylum seekers immediately it would be used as a marketing tool by people smugglers, because they view Australia and New Zealand as essentially the same country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be marketed by the people smugglers as a backdoor to Australia. Let's be quite clear about this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything the Greens and people on the left of the Labor party say about this is used as marketing by the people smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're saying to these people 'Don't budge, don't budge, get lots of pictures on the Australian news, the ABC is giving it a big run' - I'm not criticising you for covering it, but you know - they'll say 'It's getting a big run in the Australian media, and before too long the Australian government will weaken and allow you to come to Australia',&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That will then be the big opportunity, the marketing opportunity that the people smugglers [want].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch recently detailed an upsurge in violent attacks on refugees and asylum seekers by groups of armed locals. On Tuesday last week there were multiple reports of looting by locals after staff abandoned the centre.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK-backed Libyan coastguard is running a racket in the Mediterranean Seaby turning its legitimate power to stop migrant crossings into a cash cow, according to victims' accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guards allegedly stop smuggler vessels offshore and detain those onboard, before taking bribes to later release them. Migrants say they are then able to attempt another crossing to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch (HRW) has collected numerous testimonies from migrants intercepted at sea who subsequently bribed their way out of Libyan detention centres. HRW says the accounts are tantamount to evidence EU funding could be exacerbating the refugee crisis it aims to fix.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St&eacute;phane, a 30-year-old man from Cameroon, told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Independent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he was beaten and robbed by uniformed members of the force while attempting the treacherous boat crossing to Italy in June. This crossing had been organised by a Cameroonian smuggler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While they were beating us they demanded money, dollars, telephones - they took everything,&quot; he said. &quot;They claimed that if we gave them money, they would have taken us to Italy themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St&eacute;phane and the other passengers were transferred to a prison near Sabratha, one of the biggest smuggling hubs in Libya, where he was kept for three weeks.</SPAN></P>

With no money or possessions left after the first crossing, the bribe to release St&eacute;phaneand 56 other people was paid by the same Cameroonian smuggler who organised the initial crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St&eacute;phane was then taken to the same house he stayed in before his first crossing attempt, beforeboardinganother smugglers' dinghy and five days laterbeing rescued and transferred to Sicily unchallenged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St&eacute;phane told of horrific experiences in Libya, where he was kidnapped for ransom by two separate armed militias before attempting to flee to Italy, where he now hopes to complete his law studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His account is the latest in a series of allegations levelled at the Libyan coastguard, which has allegedly shot at humanitarian rescue ships, beat migrants and caused sinkings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite credible evidence of abuses, the Ministry of Defence has embarked on a third round of training whichstarted inOctober 2016, taking on 60 Libyan coastguard members in total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two rounds of programmesincluding human rights education have been completed offshore and in recent daysa classroom-based course on maritime law, navigation and boat-handling has started at a military base in Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe has steadily been increasing its cooperation with Libya's fragile Government of National Accord (GNA), following the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants in crossings whichhave killed more than 15,000 men, women and children over the past four years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government insists it carries out &quot;robust assessments&quot; on its partners, despite mounting evidence Libyan coastguard operations are both inhumane and ineffective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty UK's director for refugee and migrant rights, said St&eacute;phane's story matched evidence of migrants being &quot;passed from the coastguard to detention centres where they may be sold on to smugglers and others&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;There isn't effectively a government to deal with in Libya but the EU is pursuing its obsession to stop people reaching Europe, regardless of the consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Valdez-Symonds said the &quot;chaotic&quot; aftermath of Libya's civil war, when the UK was among Nato members bombing Muammar Gaddafi's forces before he was overthrown and killed, meant money was difficult to trace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got people in quasi-official positions like that of a coastguard who are probably not being paid regularly or properly supervised,&quot; he warned. &quot;Whether of their own initiative or as part of the operation they're being directed in, these sort of abuses do seem to be pretty common.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the International Organisation for Migration, there are between 700,000 and one million migrants in Libya, with between 5,000 and 6,000 of those in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flow over the Central Mediterranean has been relatively steady since 2014 but dipped temporarily over the summer amid suspicions militias had been paid to hold migrants back using money from the Italian interior ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judith Sutherland, the associate Europe director for Human Rights Watch, warned of an &quot;overlap&quot; between smugglers, armed groups and recognised authorities in Libya, which remains fractured between two rival governments and numerous militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are concerned about the violent, reckless, erratic behaviour of coastguard forces receiving support and equipment from Europe,&quot; Ms Sutherland said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are unreliable partners and a lot of evidence collected points to collusion between Libyan coastguard forces and smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So there's very clearly a danger that EU money, training and equipment is feeding a cycle contributing to further pain and suffering, and ultimately not serving its aims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sutherland said HRW had documented no substantial change either in the flow of refugees or conditions in Libya since EU training programmes started more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Government spokesperson said the UK carries out robust assessments on all partners, including impact analysis and human rights compliance checks, before providing support in fragile states with poor human rights records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All our work considers possible risks to vulnerable migrants,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Libya, our support is saving lives, improving conditions and rights for migrants. The alternative would be to turn a blind eye to their suffering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the GNA told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Libyan government takes these allegations very seriously. We have a zero tolerance for corruption in any instances and will investigate these very serious allegations before taking the appropriate action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are doing our best, in the most difficult circumstances imaginable, to provide appropriate facilities for migrants onshore and protective measures of our coastline offshore. We are committed to fighting illegal human trafficking with our international partners.<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8203;</SPAN>&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elise Levasseur, Lisa D. Duran, Suzanne K. Sukkar and Kevin Weber</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 26, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and consolidated two key lower court cases related to the Trump Administration's Executive Orders (&quot;EO's&quot;) on travel and refugees issued earlier in 2017. The consolidated case will be heard during the Court's first session of the October 2017 term. The Court also granted a partial stay of the injunctions preventing implementation of the travel ban of nationals of affected countries and ban on refugees from all countries but seemingly, the new order will not apply to many people while the Court case proceeds. The order does permit the Trump Administration to proceed with its planned review of world-wide visa security and screening procedures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court-permitted ban is much narrower than the Trump Administration's EO's. Under the court order, officers of the Department of Homeland Security (&quot;DHS&quot;), the US. Department of State (&quot;DOS&quot;) and others are authorized to ban for a period of 90 days travelers from the six affected countries: Libya, Iran, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Somalia, but only if those in question cannot demonstrate a bona fide relationship with a U.S.-based family member or entity. Refugees without a bona fide relationship with a U.S. individual or entity will be banned for a period of 120 days. Also, travelers cannot seek to establish a relationship with an entity solely for the purpose of evading the EO's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For individuals, a close family relationship is needed to overcome the ban. An individual who seeks to enter the U.S. to live with or visit a family member, such as a spouse or mother-in-law, &quot;clearly&quot; has such a relationship in specific examples outlined by the court order. With regard to entities, the relationship must be formal, documented and formed in the ordinary course of business. The Court cited examples of an offer of employment from a U.S.company, or a lecturer invited to address a U.S. audience as having a relationship with a U.S. entity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 26, 2017, the DHS issued a statement confirming that it would later provide details on implementation after consultation with the Department of Justice (&quot;DOJ&quot;) and the DOS. The DHS further advised that implementation of the Court order &quot;will be done professionally with clear and sufficient public notice, particular to potentially affected travelers, and in coordination with partners in the travel industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ruling appears to affect only a very small number of travelers to the U.S. and should not affect the following depending on instructions coming from the DHS:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Individuals with current valid visas (from the six affected countries) may continue to use their visas to travel to the U.S.Those who are applying for visas will need to demonstrate a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the U.S. during their visa interview.Lawful Permanent Residents of the U.S., Asylees and others exempted from the EO's including those already admitted as refugees, individuals traveling on advance parole and those granted withholding of removal and/or CAT (Convention Against Torture) are not included in the ban.Diplomats holding NATO, C-2, G-1, G-2 and G-3 or G-4 visas as well as dual nationals traveling on a passport issued by a non-affected country will be able to travel freely without having to demonstrate a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the U.S.Refugees who are authorized to enter the U.S. have a bona fide relationship with refugee agency may have a bona fide relationship with a U.S. entity.Temporary workers from affected countries applying for an H, L, E, I, O P, Q or R nonimmigrant visas who have accepted an offer of employment from a U.S.company should be able to demonstrate a bona fide relationship with a U.S. entity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Syrian refugee who was brought to the UK from Calais a year ago under the scheme lobbied for by Lord Alf Dubs has thanked the Government for his new start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ishmael, who fled Syria in 2015 aged 15, spent more than a year in the Jungle migrant camp across the Channel, along with thousands of others hoping for a new start in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He estimates he made more than a hundred attempts to get into the country by lorry and boat, before becoming one of 200 vulnerable children to be transferred in October last year when the camp was demolished.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost a year to the day that he arrived in England, the 18-year-old has thanked British authorities for their support and urged them to continue providing a safe haven for others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: ``My message is just to be thankful for the British Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The help they provide us is like...we cannot imagine, it's really important for us, so I want them to do this same experience with other people, to look after other people, because they built our lives again so that's really important for me to say thanks for them and to try the same experience again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The-then 17-year-old was bussed to the UK on October 25 along with hundreds of other children under the so-called Dubs Amendment aimed at helping vulnerable lone child refugees on mainland Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he is living with a foster family in north London and doing a foundation year at Birkbeck, University of London, to prepare for undergraduate studies in politics and international relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is excited about working for a career in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year on from his life-changing journey, he will be reunited with some of the other teenagers who were taken to safety from the camp, for a public thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ishmael and other refugees, accompanied by campaigners from Safe Passage and Help Refugees, will present a plaque to Parliament on Tuesday, which will be accepted by Lord Dubs, the scheme's architect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inscription reads: ``We thank the British people and Parliament for giving us peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We found a beautiful life in the UK, so different to the life we fled. We were suffering, but now we are safe.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ishmael said: ``For Syrian people, we lost our country, we lost our safety, we lost everything, and it's really important for the UK Government to try to give us a home, a safe life, it's really important for these people to try to help bring people here because they have nothing, the Syrian people, to do now, without any country and they need someone to look after them after all that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year it emerged that the Dubs scheme would close once 480 unaccompanied minors were brought to the UK, well below the 3,000 campaigners had called for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than half (approximately 200) have so far been resettled in the UK under the scheme, and charities are urging the Government to commit to bringing over the remainder by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities estimate between 700 and 800 refugees and migrants are gathered in Calais and the surrounding area of which around 200 are unaccompanied minors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how he felt about this, Ishmael said: ``It's really difficult because they are alone now without anyone looking after them, they cannot do anything, they just look around all the place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``So it's really important there's someone behind them and trying to support them to bring them here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokeswoman said: ``We continue to work closely with the French authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely under the Dublin Regulation and the Dubs Amendment.''</SPAN></P>

What lights were on might have been seen from the distance by the more than 500 people packed on an overcrowded boat sailing from Libya, carrying refugees mainly from Eritrea, Somalia and Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever they saw from the Mediterranean, more than half of the passengers on the ship would not survive the night to find out what laid beyond the water's edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the shipwreck on 3 October, 2013, it would emerge that the 20-metre long fishing boat began to sink after suffering engine trouble less than a quarter of a mile from Lampedusa. A blanket set on fire in a frantic bid to grab the attention of potential rescuers only made things worse - igniting gasoline and engulfing the boat in flames, forcing many passengers to throw themselves from the ship, while others gathered at one end of the sinking boat, causing it to capsize further.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly to some degree, his actions might have come from a place of remorse - but in large part, the move was likely part of a bid to save his reputation and prevent potential customers from turning to one of his many rivals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the illicit business of people smuggling, reputation, researchers at Cambridge University's Institute of Criminology say, is everything - at least, for those who want to stay in the trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Demand is satisfied by a plethora of actors,&quot; Dr Paolo Campana, an expert in criminal networks at Cambridge, says. &quot;It's not uncommon for many people to have another job, like owning a shop even, and be working as a people smuggler on the side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market is very competitive, so smugglers have to go out of their way to attract people and convince them to choose them over someone else,&quot; Campana says. &quot;That can be the difficult part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going social in an illicit trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how does one go about marketing an illicit service in a trade that international bodies across Europe are working to shut down?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer can be as easy as a 10-minute search on Facebook, depending on how good your web-surfing skills are. Smugglers have been found with a simple search for key words like &quot;Libya&quot; and &quot;passage&quot; written in Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I tried to find one myself and it only took a handful of minutes before I came up with a page that appeared to be advertising such services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't say with certainty, but yes, it looks like it may be connected to some smuggling activity based on the English translation,&quot; Campana agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook is just one of the means,&quot; he says. &quot;Because the market is so competitive, they have to find a way to do it and Facebook is one of the ways. They post pictures of themselves, of successful crossings, of their boats, and it's all a way to build trust and credibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson from Facebook told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the social media company works closely with law enforcement agencies around the world to shut down any pages or posts promoting people smuggling services on its website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People smuggling is illegal and any posts, pages or groups that coordinate this activity are not allowed on Facebook,&quot; the spokesperson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We urge people to use our reporting tools to flag any content that they suspect may be illegal or violate our standards so it can be reviewed and swiftly removed by our global team of experts, who work closely with law enforcement agencies around the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its bid to crack down on illicit networking on its platform, the social media giant has also recently announced it will be adding an additional 3,000 people to its investigative team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even more effective than Facebook, Campana says, is the age-old method of word of mouth. Most of the people researchers spoke to relied on the reviews of friends and family to find a smuggler they believed they could trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Syrian refugee told researchers at Cambridge: &quot;We spoke to people that we knew, people who left and who arrived and asked, 'which smuggler did you go with? How was the behaviour of the smuggler?' In the end, there were three smugglers that had honest behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campana says that the fact that not everyone has access to a platform like Facebook, or the skills to use the technology, means that many have little choice but to rely on word of mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Education really matters. If you have the skills to use technology and find information, you are in a much better place,&quot; Campana says. &quot;Human smuggling reflects the broader world in that sense. It's a mirror image. Young, educated Syrians for example, who are on the internet can find the info more easily. If you are older and don't have access to technology, you have to rely on family, friends and word of mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smugglers who are interested in staying in the illicit business for the long term know that they must deliver on their promises if they don't want to be shut out of the black market, Campana says. That is one of the main aspects of smuggling that set it apart from human trafficking, though the two are often mistakenly conflated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From an analytical perspective, human trafficking and smuggling are very different. With trafficking, the commodity at stake is control of a person with intent to exploit that person. The central element is control,&quot; Campana says. &quot;With smuggling, the commodity at stake is the crossing of a border, getting from A to B and that is what smugglers care about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, as the devastating death toll of thousands of refugees who have lost their lives due to overcrowding on ships and ill-prepared crews will show, that does not mean smugglers who aren't interested in playing the long game don't get greedy. A refugee living in Greece described to The Independent how the transfer he had arranged from Egypt turned deadly after his boat, overloaded with passengers, began to sink during the crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was in a little boat with 17 other people and there were these two baby girls on it. It capsized near Turkey,&quot; he said. &quot;A helicopter came for us in the end and the police came, but they were too late. Two women and the two baby girls died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, while exploitation is not the main goal, it does sometimes happen,&quot; Campana says. &quot;Sometimes the smuggling is overpriced. Sometimes they make promises that they know they won't deliver. They promise a high quality boat and then provide a small dinghy. They promise immediate departure and then make you wait for days. Some care about safety, while others are more reckless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Staggering' growth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike other forms of organised crime, the illicit business of human smuggling is a &quot;quintessential free market&quot; with few controls over who gets involved, Campana says. &quot;I was surprised by the fragmentation of the market and the competition - and its ability to grow,&quot; the researcher adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the percentages, the rate of growth has been staggering,&quot; the researcher says. &quot;I have hardly seen such growth in other illegal markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8203;</SPAN>People smuggling now represents the third-largest business for international criminals, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has said, with as many as 1.8 million illegal border crossings recorded between 2010 and 2016, according to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex). IOM estimates that people smugglers make a total of roughly $35bn (&pound;27bn) a year worldwide, with a boom in profits in recent years from the migrant crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campana's research has found that the number of illegal border crossings along the Eastern Mediterranean route alone, which includes crossings into Greece and Italy, increased by 1,641 per cent from 2014 to 2015, translating into 885,386 illegal entries in 2015, compared to 50,834 in the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says recent efforts to stem the surge in smuggling activity have shown some progress, however, with land-based policies like the2016 deal betweenthe EU and Turkey, whichsees the country accepting the return of most asylum seekers who travel through its territory in exchange for billions of euros in aid, prompting a slow-down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question becomes whether these flows will shift, for example, from the Central Mediterranean to the Western Mediterranean. Also, it might prove quite challenging to implement a similar agreement in places like Libya - both from a human rights perspective and a practical perspective. However, what it is clear, I think, is that naval operations like the ones in the Mediterranean are not being effective in disrupting smuggling operations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding 'Mr Big'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stopping smugglers from operating is a challenging enterprise, Campana says, for several reasons. First, there are limited barriers when it comes to entering the market. The business of people smuggling requires limited capital and relatively few skills. In a country, such as Libya, he says, militias are often also willing to grant smugglers protection for a fee, working as enforcers for those who are willing to pay the price to operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a large part of the problem is the sheer number of smugglers operating in the market - and the fact that there is little hierarchy among its participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Campana says it may seem tempting to frame criminal markets as being dominated by a select few &quot;masterminds&quot;, he believes an important part of the puzzle of how to successfully crack down on people smuggling is looking at the illicit trade as a free market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In such an unregulated market, there are no kingpins or monopolies. Targeting one smuggler or one specific group will do little good &quot;because if one smuggler is targeted, his market share, so to speak, would be taken by others&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The structure of smuggling is a far cry from the typical hierarchy of say, the mafia, the typical 'godfather' style does not exist,&quot; the researcher adds. &quot;It's made up of very fragmented groups. Here, there are no Mr Bigs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trawler carrying Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Burma has capsized, drowning at least five people, as the UN said the crisis has pushed more than 125,000 refugees into Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of Shah Porir Dwip fishing village recovered five bodies from the Bay of Bengal, hours after the boat capsized at around midnight, said police official Yakub Ali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear where the boat began its journey, or if the passengers had been among 450 detained by Bangladeshi border guards and ordered on Tuesday to return to Burma.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some border guards were letting refugees across the borders, others were sending them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi has blamed a misinformation campaign for fuelling the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with mounting numbers and a lack of space and basic supplies, Bangladesh said it will set up a new camp to accommodate Rohingya refugees who have arrived from Burma since August 25, many walking for days and crossing jungles and rivers to reach safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shah Kamal of the Ministry of Disaster Management did not say when the new camp would be ready. He said it will be established in Tyingkhali, south of Cox's Bazar district and near the established camp in Balukhali where more than 50,000 Rohingya have been sheltering since October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked officials to prepare a database with fingerprints for the new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of Rohingya fleeing western Rakhine state has reached more than 125,000, 80% of whom are women and children, said Unicef executive director Anthony Lake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many more children in need of support and protection remain in the areas of northern Rakhine state that have been wracked by violence,&quot; he said in a statement, adding that the UN refugee agency has no access to Rakhine trouble spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are unable to reach the 28,000 children to whom we were previously providing psycho-social care or the more than 4,000 children who were treated for malnutrition in Buthidaung and Maungdaw&quot; in Rakhine, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our clean water and sanitation work has been suspended, as have school repairs that were under way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence and civilian suffering have prompted international condemnation and resonated particularly in many Muslim countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Suu Kyi complained to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call that Turkey's deputy prime minister was a victim of fake news when he posted photos purportedly showing dead Rohingya that were not related to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photos on Mehmet Simsek's Twitter account have since been taken down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her office, Ms Suu Kyi said such misinformation helps promote the interests of &quot;terrorists&quot;, a reference to Rohingya insurgents whose deadly attacks on Burmese security posts on August 25 triggered the latest military crackdown and streams of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military has said nearly 400 people, most of them insurgents, have died in clashes. Security forces responded to the attacks with days of &quot;clearance operations&quot; the government says were aimed at rooting out insurgents it accuses of setting fire to Rohingya villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many displaced Rohingya, however, say it was Burmese soldiers who set their homes on fire and fired indiscriminately around villages in Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya Muslims have long faced discrimination in the majority-Buddhist south-east Asian country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey said Burma agreed to allow its aid officials to enter Rakhine state with a ton of food and goods for Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said it was crucial for Burma's government to immediately give Rohingya either nationality or legal status so they can lead normal lives and freely move, find jobs and get an education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited a long-standing history of &quot;discrimination, hopelessness and extreme poverty&quot; for Rohingya and warned of possible ethnic cleansing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Presbyterian Minister feels &quot;absolutely elated and very humbled&quot; by the generous donations he received in support of his Camino journey.&nbsp;<BR>He has complied a book called Peregrino (Spanish for pilgrim), the sales from which will continue to raise funds for refugees returning to war-torn Syria and in Jordan, which has hosted more than 650,000 Syrian refugees since 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, &pound;20,000 was distributed to a charity called the Barnabas Fund which works with a doctor and pastor in Aleppo called Dr. Jany Haddad.&nbsp;<BR>That money is being spent on sinking four wells in east Aleppo, where internally displaced people have returned to their homes since the liberation by the Syrian army last December. Those wells will provide crystal clear water to 60,000 people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">READ:&nbsp;Rev.David Cupples on 'speaking with God' on 1,050km Camino</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further &pound;20,000 was sent to Rev. Colin Dickson who runs a church in Jordan which has a ministry for refugees from Syria and Iraq.&nbsp;<BR>&quot;Colin teaches at Jordan Evangelical Theological Seminary, where some of the students are refugees who are struggling to provide for their families,&quot; said Rev. Cupples.&nbsp;<BR>&quot;I have benefitted so much from education and theological training, I wanted to help them also.&quot;<BR>Since Rev. Cupples returned from his pilgrimage in May, an additional &pound;10,000 has flowed into his fundraising account.&nbsp;<BR>He also expects book sales to generate more money in the coming months. 'Peregrino' features 84 daily readings and includes bible readings, stories about people he met and things that happened along the way. A QR code at the bottom of each reflection can be scanned using a barcode scanner app installed on a smart phone or a tablet, taking the reader to a song or hymn that struck a chord with Rev. Cupples as he walked.<BR>&quot;Each daily reflection has a Bible reading on the page, so it is really a book for believers, for people with a church background or who would at least be willing to read a Bible passage. People on an earnest spiritual quest should find it accessible,&quot; said Rev. Cupples.<BR>&quot;If people want to use it for 15 minutes of reflection a day, they can have music, a bible reading and a thought for the day,&quot; he added. He outlined how he &quot;left normal life behind&quot; and &quot;walked into an open space physically and spiritually to listen to God.&quot;<BR>Rev. Cupples stated: &quot;God spoke in many ways and gave me many wonderful experiences, moments, meetings and thoughts. There were many mundane, ordinary, weary and lonely hours but everything contributed to a unique experience that was enjoyable, educational and which I knew was playing a big part in the formation of my soul.&quot;<BR>He added: &quot;This little book makes no pretence of being a handbook for Christian discipleship, of covering all aspects of Christian living. It simply passes on some of the things that God spoke to me about on the Camino. It is a snapshot of my spiritual journey during that time, part of my ongoing learning and living the life of a Christian pilgrim.&quot;<BR>The book is available from the Church Mouse Shop on East Bridge Street which is open on Fridays, the Real Life Bookshop, by emailing Rev. Cupples directly on dcupples57@gmail.com or by sending him a message through his facebook page: David's Camino.<BR>He concluded: &quot;I hope people will enjoy it and I hope it will help them on their journey of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are so grateful to be here in a safe country, that's the main thing, and despite everything they are some of the happiest and kindest people I've ever met.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year in Germany sparked Tazmin's passion to work with refugees and learn about their journeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officially there are a million refugees in Germany but that number is a lot higher, and it was great to see how they have been integrated into society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the volume of people made it easier to come to terms with, whereas here there are so few refugees, some find it scary or difficult to cope with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's fear of the unknown but you quickly realise these are people like yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got so much in common with the boys I've met, despite what they've been through. It's nothing to be afraid of, rather it's something to welcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, part of a national City of Sanctuary movement, work closely with West Sussex County Council to support unaccompanied asylum seeking children and families arriving from war-torn Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has just finished redecorating a third flat ready for a Syrian family to move into, while members are personally housing young male asylum seekers who otherwise would be homeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Pask, Sanctuary in Chichester founder, said: &quot;The work of young people like Tazmin is invaluable to what we are trying to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have 44 people doing face-to-face work and another 140 in the background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So it's a growing network of people in the Chichester area who are doing some really amazing work and showing that it doesn't take a huge amount to make the world a better place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Red Cross estimates there are 65 million people throughout the world who have been forced to flee their homes, creating more than 22 million refugees, 5.5 million from Syria.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees are dying in the Mediterranean because of &quot;reckless&quot; EU operations destroying smugglers' safest boats, Amnesty International has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights groupclaims the EU has &quot;turned its back&quot; on a search and rescue strategy that was reducing mortality, in a new report, entitled &quot;A Perfect Storm&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It argues that the search and rescue measures implemented in 2015 dramatically decreased death at sea, but EU governments have now shifted their focus to disrupting smugglers and preventing boats departing from Libya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU naval Operation Sophia, also known as EU Navfor Med, destroyed so many of the wooden boats used by smugglers that huge numbers of people are now making the crossing on less safe rubber dinghies, Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Not possible': EU demolishes key aim of Tory of Brexit strategy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With insufficient fuel, no life jackets or other safety features, and often with no means to call for help, such as a satellite phone, these boats have virtually no chance of reaching European coasts by themselves and they are in need of rescue from the moment they depart,&quot; the report states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that in the first half of 2017, 73,000 refugees and migrants reached Italy by sea, 14 per cent more than in the same period the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated that by the end of June, 2,0030 people haddied or gone missing when making the crossing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theorganisationwarned that at this rate, 2017 could be the deadliest year for migrantsin the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said: &quot;With 2.5 deaths for every 100 people attempting the crossing, 2016 was the deadliest year to date for refugees and migrants on the central Mediterranean. At current rates, the death toll in 2017 promises to be just as high, if not higher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU has two operations in the region including the border control operation Triton, the military operation and Sophiawhich dedicated to destroying smugglers' boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian navy also runsMare Sicuro, a surveillance operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Amnesty International said these operations were prioritising anti-smugglingoperations, surveillance and maritime security instead of dealing with the humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reportblamed the &quot;reckless EU strategy&quot; for failing to stop departures from Libya and preventing further loss of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said, the EU strategy was in fact &quot;exposing refugees and migrants to even greater risks at sea&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International found that when refugees and migrants were disembarked back in Libya &quot;they faced horrific conditions in detention, torture and rape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It claimed Libyan coast guards working in cooperation with the EU were capsizing migrant boats in poorly carried out rescue operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some instances, it alleged that the coast guards would also subject migrants to &quot;forced labour, rape and other sexual violence&quot; and &quot;beat them with sticks or gun butts.&quot;Others were robbed of of their phones and money, it claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People arriving in Italy were identified by Amnesty as hailing fromSyria and African countries likeNigeria, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Senegal, Mali and Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority were fleeing frompolitical persecution, arbitrary detention and torture, rather thaneconomic reasons, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Europe director, said: &quot;If the second half of this year continues as the first and urgent action is not taken, 2017 looks set to become the deadliest year for the deadliest migration route in the world.The EU must rethink its cooperation with Libya's woefully dysfunctional coastguard and deploy more vessels where they are desperately needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ultimately the only sustainable and humane way to reduce the numbers risking such horrific journeys is to open more safe and legal routes for migrants and refugees to reach Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been called the world's forgotten war and its worst humanitarian disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For nearly three years now, Yemen has been embroiled in a bloody civil conflict and now stands on the brink of total collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houthi rebels, reportedly backed by Iran, are fighting the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who is supported by a Saudi-led coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airstrikes and a naval blockade have pushed the country to the brink of famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 10,000 people have been killed and cholera cases will soon exceed one million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday alone, at least 26 people were killed in an airstrike in the Sahar district of Saada province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions have been displaced by the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of thousands have fled across the sea to the tiny African country of Djibouti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR has set up a refugee camp near the small port of Obock to accommodate the new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are currently 1,500 Yemeni refugees at the Markazi refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp's newest arrivals are a family of nine who endured a seven-hour journey in a boat that was taking on water to get to Djibouti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father, who declined to give his name, said he had lost friends and relatives to the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know who shot them&quot;, he said. &quot;The killing and shooting were everywhere. Nobody knows from where the shooting came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Life has stopped. Children cannot go to school. I cannot go to work. This is why I had to leave my homeland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another refugee we met was 65-year-old Ali Shafek Aman, an urban planner living in Aden city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has lived through three wars in Yemen but he fled when his apartment was destroyed in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He despairs of Yemen's warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I escaped from the war because I believe in life I don't believe in death ... When I have seen death everywhere to the innocent people, to the educated people ... because I am a civilised citizen from the city, I have no tribe, I have no relatives to go to ... so I have found myself insisted to run away and to go to the sea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He despairs of Yemen's warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are blind, they are living in darkness, because of this they are fighting, they are killing ... everywhere, they just believe in death ... Why?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Djibouti city, Leonard Doyle of the International Organisation for Migration has just returned from Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The humanitarian situation is desperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;80% of people are insecure, they don't know where their next meal is coming from ... about 31 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge problems with access to clean drinking water, why is that important? Well, it's important because cholera is now striking Yemen. Approximately one million people will have been affected by cholera by the year's end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Doyle believes only one thing can effect change in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The eyes of the world have to see what's happening, so journalists have to be allowed in. And it's kind of shocking that the coalition and others deem it not appropriate to have external eyes on it because that's what we need, we need to know what's going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the media that help shift politics when things are going bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Bosnia so many years ago, it was the reporting of the death camps in Bosnia that moved political leaders ... to order military action or some political action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we need to somehow find a way to galvanise international opinion and one great way of doing that is to allow journalists in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of thousands of Syrian refugees have returned to the country so far this year amid fresh hope for lasting ceasefires in some cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said it was seeing a &quot;notable trend of spontaneous returns&quot; from outside and inside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 31,000 refugees returned from neighbouring countries in the first six months of 2017, while more than 440,000 internally displaced people went back to their homes - a combined total of almosthalf a million people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Syrian man walks his dog in the once rebel-held al-Shaar neighbourhood of Aleppo(AFP/Getty Images)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrej Mahecic, a spokesperson for the UNHCR, said the main destinations were Aleppo, Hama, HomsandDamascus - all of which are partly or wholly controlled by the Syrian government after devastating battles against rebel groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mahecic said Syrians were seeking out family members, checking on property, and &quot;in some cases responding toa real or perceived improvement in security conditions in parts of the country&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarin nerve gas was used on Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he warned that although there is fresh hope over recent peace talks in Astana and Geneva, the &quot;UNHCR believes conditions for refugees to return in safety and dignity are not yet in place in Syria&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sustainability of security improvements in many return areas is uncertain, and there remain significant risks of protection thresholds for voluntary, safe and dignified returns not being met in parts of the country,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Access to the displaced population inside Syria remains a key challenge, with aid convoys still unable to access regularly even the recently newly accessible areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limited progress has been made in the UN-backed peace talks in Geneva, while the West is wary of ceasefires brokered by Bashar al-Assad's allies Russia and Iran, and rebel-supporting Turkey in Astana.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Isis and al-Qaeda linked alliance Tahrir al-Sham are barred from all talks and continue to hold swathes of territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR is scaling up its operations inside Syria for the new arrivals, providing &quot;protection services&quot; andshelter andimproving damaged infrastructure and basic services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It warned that mass returns will not be sustainable without employment opportunities, adequate food and water, health care and education - all of which have been severely damaged by the six-year civil war, seeing the illegal targeting of infrastructure and widespread destruction of hospitals and schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this stage and while UNHCR will be investing to help, with other partners to improve conditions in accessible areas inside Syria, refugee returns from host countries can neither be promoted nor facilitated by UNHCR,&quot; Mr Mahecic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He emphasised that access to asylum for Syrians and allowing them to stay in host countries remained &quot;critical&quot;, reiterating an appeal for $304m (&pound;230m) in funding for displaced people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Kennedy, the UN regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria, said almost 14 million of the 18 million people currently living in the country in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of those, 4.5 million are trapped in besieged or hard to reach areas &quot;in desperate need&quot; of aid, which is being blocked by both the Syrian government and rebel groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over onethird of Syrians are displaced within the country, while about 5 million more have fled, mainly to Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2015, at least 260,000 refugees have spontaneously returned to Syria, primarily from neighbouring Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     European countries including Germany, Austria and Norway have been offering financial incentives for asylum seekers to voluntarily return to their home nations as borders have hardened throughout the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority of Syrians arrived on treacherous boat crossings to Greek islands but arrivals have slowed to a trickle since the controversial EU-Turkey deal was imposed in March last year, seeing anyone arriving over the Aegean Sea detained under threat of deportation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, while 22,000 people were tracking in slow motion every move of Priti Patel's return flight from Kenya to resign, I joined Rohingya refugees at the Kutupalong Camp near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, to see the scale of the crisis first hand, hear directly from those affected, and understand the reality on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is hard to convey in words. The International Organisation for Migration estimates that 823,805 Rohingya people now need urgent support. Some 611,000 have crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar since the end of August - a mass exodus that represents one of the largest population movements in living memory, anywhere. It is, as the UN Refugee Agency told me, like establishing a city the size of Manchester overnight - but one with no infrastructure, housing, water, sanitation or tools for survival.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers are frightening. But it is the details that are most devastating. The recently reopened school I visited, supposed to be a rare source of hope, falls short of demand, meaning children can learn only in shifts. Two whole families, who I saw on the way out, live together under a single piece of tarpaulin. I met a community leader who was born in the same camp a generation ago - living his entire life without a permanent home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the 25-year-old man I met who, more than anything, wants citizenship, residency, and the chance to make a new life; the long queues everywhere for food, shelter, and clothing packages; the sea of makeshift shelters, stretching as far as the eye can see. It was simply heart-wrenching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya crisis: Muslim village burnt to the ground</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But amid the desperation, there is also hope. The response of the humanitarian community and the care shown by aid workers on the front line stands in stark contrast to the Rohingya's traumatic experience at the hands of the military in Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers rarely seek recognition, but their incredible efforts in these hardest of circumstances must be truly celebrated. There was real hope too in the agency, energy, and resilience of the Rohingya refugees I met, all of whom had fought hard for their own survival, and won.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What one volunteer witnessed from the frontline of the Rohingya crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is much that needs to happen. In the camp itself, more physical space is urgently needed as the humanitarian operation enters the next phase. Bangladesh, Myanmar and the international community must quickly work for a solution to give the Rohingya the full citizenship they deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Jordan or Uganda, the country of Bangladesh has taken in close to a million refugees in a short period of time, putting incredible stress on its limited resources. If Bangladesh is to deliver a progressive refugee policy under such strain, the international community must step up its support. The UK must play its part, by continuing to pledge generously and building international political will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be no quick or easy solutions. But the UK - with a very significant footprint in Bangladesh through the Department for International Development - has a key role to play in navigating the complex solutions that are needed over the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do that, parliamentarians, the media and the new Secretary of State for International Development all need to keep our eye firmly on the ball in Bangladesh, rather than on Patel's self-inflicted distraction in Whitehall. It is time for the spotlight to shine not on the disgraced politician, but on the Rohingya crisis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saudi security forces say that they have driven &quot;terrorists&quot; and wanted criminals from 90 per cent of the ancient walled neighbourhood of Al-Masoura in the town of Awamiya in the restive Eastern Province, where much of the kingdom's Shia minority lives. Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya yesterday published what it says are the first images of the destruction caused by terrorists, while Iranian Arabic-language Al-Alam TV aired a video report also which it says was destroyed solely by government forces. The channel said that the authorities had wanted to destroy the area as it had been a focal point of anti-government protests in recent years. Awamiya was the hometown of prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, whose execution early last year prompted outrage amongst Shias across the region. Demolition of buildings in the neighbourhood began in recent months in order to pave the way for a development project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Humanitarian&quot; passages opened in southern Damascus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian opposition media sources report that a humanitarian corridor has been opened between the Yarmouk refugee camp and the rebel-held town of Yalda in southern Damascus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition Enab Baladi news website reported that the corridors were opened after a deal was brokered between the rebels in control of the town of Yalda, and the so-called Islamic State group (IS), which is in control of the besieged Yarmouk refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal would see the evacuation of people who need urgent medical care and are in a critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of the Palestinian refugee camp have been subjected to harsh humanitarian conditions due to a siege that led to the death of hundreds of people, according to Enab Baladi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel reveals underground barrier to block Hamas tunnels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Israeli army has unveiled plans to build a massive underground barrier to block cross-border smuggling tunnels from the blockaded Gaza Strip, built by Hamas group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction of the barrier began last year with a cost of over 83m US dollars and will be completed within two years, according to the Times of Israel website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The website quoted the head of the Southern Command, Maj-Gen Eyal Zamir, as saying that the construction of the barrier &quot;can potentially lead to a dangerous escalation&quot; with the Palestinians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon sees political tensions over relations with Syria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Lebanese ministers from the Hezbollah and Amal parties, which have maintained good relations with the Syrian government, will be participating in the Damascus International Festival focusing on the country's reconstruction later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter has stirred considerable controversy between rival parties who have opposing stances regarding restoring relations with Syria. The issue has resurfaced especially since the operations Hezbollah led against the jihadist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group on the border with Lebanon, and the anticipated operations to be led by the Lebanese army against IS locations in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israeli PM accuses left, media of trying to oust him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing corruption allegations, has accused the leftist opposition and the media of trying to oust him, pro-left Haaretz daily reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to hundreds of supporters at a Tel Aviv rally yesterday, the premier said that both the left and the media were carrying out an &quot;obsessive, unprecedented hunting trip&quot; against him and and his family with the aim of carrying out a &quot;government coup&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Netanyahu had been questioned by police on allegations of receiving gifts from businessmen and communicating with a publisher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife has been charged with using government funds to pay for personal expenses at the family's private residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social buzz</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hashtags are trending in the UAE contributing to the ongoing spat between Qatar and its Gulf neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hashtag &quot;Israel's alliance with the blockade countries&quot; criticises Saudi newspaper Al-Riyadh's description of Hamas as a &quot;terrorist&quot; group. Several users say that Saudi Arabia, and earlier Egypt, are adopting the same line against the Palestinian group as Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other hashtag &quot;ambassadors of darkness&quot; is the name of a TV show that reportedly reveals the link between &quot;terrorist&quot; groups and figures, and Qatar.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caught in the crossfire between Myanmar's military and Rohingya insurgents, hundreds of Hindus fleeing Bangladesh are placing their hopes on the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in neighbouring India for safe shelter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 500 people are currently sheltered in a cleared-out chicken farm in a Hindu hamlet in Bangladesh's southeast, a couple of miles from where most of the 421,000 Rohingya Muslims who have also fled violence in Myanmar since Aug. 25 are living in makeshift camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hindu refugees say they are scared of going back to their villages in Buddhist-majority Myanmar's restive Rakhine state, but also wary of staying in mostly Muslim Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modi's government, meanwhile, is making it easier for Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and other minorities from Bangladesh and Pakistan to gain citizenship in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'India is also known as Hindustan, the land of the Hindus,' said Niranjan Rudra, sitting on a plastic sheet in the chicken farm flanked by his wife, who sported a large vermilion red dot on her forehead typical of married Hindu women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We just want a peaceful life in India, not much. We may not get that in Myanmar or here,' he said. Fellow refugees nodded in agreement, stating that they wanted the message to reach the Indian government through the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indian government declined to comment on the Hindu refugees' hopes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government source said it was waiting while the Supreme Court hears an appeal against the home ministry's plans to deport around 40,000 Rohingya Muslims from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Achintya Biswas, a senior member of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or the World Hindu Council, which has close ties with the ideological parent of Modi's ruling party, said India was the natural destination for the Hindus fleeing Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Hindu families must be allowed to enter India by the government,' Biswas said by phone. 'Where else will they go? This is their place of origin.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biswas said the VHP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the umbrella group that mentors Modi's ruling party, would submit a report to the home ministry on the refugees and demand a new policy allowing Hindus from Myanmar and Bangladesh to seek asylum in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hindu right who form the bedrock of Modi's support have long believed India is the home for all Hindus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India's Home Ministry spokesman K.S. Dhatwalia declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior home ministry official in New Delhi, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that no Hindu in Myanmar or Bangladesh affected by the violence had approached Indian authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At this juncture we have no SOS calls from Hindus,' said the official. 'Also, the Supreme Court is yet to decide whether India should deport Rohingya Muslims or not. The matter is sub-judice and any policy decision will be taken only after the court's order.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Want to feel safe'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hindus make up a small but long-standing minority in both Myanmar and Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Rudra, a barber from Myanmar's Thit Tone Nar Gwa Son village, showed Reuters what he said was a temporary citizenship card issued in 1978 by the authorities there. The card listed his race as 'Indian' and religion as 'Hindu'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudra and other Hindu refugees said they had fled soon after Rohingya insurgents attacked 30 Myanmar police posts, triggering a fierce military counteroffensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population, leaving many villages in northern Rakhine empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Our village in Myanmar was surrounded by hundreds of men in black masks on the morning of Aug. 25,' said Veena Sheel, a mother-of-two whose husband works in Malaysia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They called some men out and asked them to fight the security forces... a few hours after we heard gunshots.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheel left the next day with eight other women and their families, walking for two days to reach Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There are so many people all around us. No peace here, no peace back in Myanmar,' said Sheel. 'We should be taken to Hindustan, that's our land. Wherever we stay, we want to feel safe.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since taking office in 2014, Modi's government has issued orders stating that no Hindu or member of another minority from Pakistan or Bangladesh would be considered an illegal immigrant even if they entered the country without valid documents on or before Dec. 31, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also plans to nearly halve to six years the period Hindus, Christians and other minorities from those countries need to have lived in India to be granted citizenship by naturalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are regularising only those who have come due to religious persecution in Bangladesh and Pakistan,' junior home minister Kiren Rijiju told Reuters last month, adding that there was no policy on refugees from Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will not be easy for secular India to accept the Myanmar Hindu refugees' demand while the government is pushing for the deportation of Rohingya Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modi's government has already been criticised by activists for not speaking out against Myanmar's military offensive, and accused of vilifying the Rohingya in the country to seek legal clearance for their deportation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so James Burgess, 34, a former pupil of St Michael's Middle and Queen Elizabeth's schools in Wimborne who together with his wife Sarah have cycled to Greece to volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple who live Leytonstone near the Olympic park spent a week volunteering in the Calais refugee camp in October last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We planned our packing, buying lightweight camping equipment that would fit in the bags on our two steel frame touring bikes. We fitted tough tires to tackle the gravel trails we came across, as well as the thousands of kilometres of tarmac. And we practised putting up the tent in our living room, packing the one change of clothes we had and cooked eggs on the gas stove in our garden before we set off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The six-week route was stunning, and not a little daunting. It was a little surreal leaving London through the Olympic Park and along the Regents Canal, crossing Tower Bridge and passing the Herne Hill velodrome with everything we would need for six months packed on our bikes. After the hilly route through Kent, we warmed up on the relatively flat land of northern France, before the serious climbing started in the Vosges Mountains of France and the Black Forest of southern Germany. The warm early spring in London turned to rain and sub-zero nights as we crossed France. Then it snowed as we reached Switzerland, delaying our journey through the mountains by several days until we got a sunny window in the weather. The skies cleared after the flat lands of northern Italy, and we rode down the magnificent Croatian coast in glorious sunshine, before turning inland in Montenegro to cross the mountains of Albania, Macedonia, and finally Greece. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The weather threatened to put an early end to our 3,000km route just 200km short of our destination, when we found ourselves half way down a mountain descent in Macedonia in the pouring rain, with temperatures dropping again, our bodies shaking from the rough road and the cold. But we were only two days away from Thessaloniki, and a cheap motel saved the day, letting us dry out our kit just enough to push on the next day. We arrived exhausted but satisfied, in a thunderstorm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volunteering begins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After a few days off, we got stuck into the volunteer work, Sarah teaching English in a refugee camp, and me working on a construction project. We met actors, musicians, engineers, accountants, doctors and businessmen who had fled conflict or persecution in their homes in Syria, Iraq and other countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The work has been rewarding and frustrating in similar measures. It's a real privilege to meet people from such diverse places, both volunteers and refugees, and it's amazing seeing the positive impact motivated people working here can have. But it's heartbreaking to see the bureaucracy and politics that stand in the way of long terms solutions, while people remain stuck in the limbo of the camps, waiting for months and years at a time to restart their lives There is a major concern that gaps in services will open up when EU funding is withdrawn this summer. Many large NGOs are already pulling out, and it seems likely that small NGOs will be left to fill in the gaps before the Greek government takes over service provision. Greece is struggling under the strain of the economic crisis there and now finds itself on the front line of the European refugee crisis, with the British government reluctant to help, opting out of the EU refugee relocation project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James and Sarah will be in Greece until the end of August, when they'll make their way back to the UK - by bike.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harrowing pictures capture the moment dozens of men and children batter their victim, before tying him to a tree, interrogating and then hanging him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man is claimed to have been trying to abduct a child on Friday when the lynch mob began to attack - kicking and punching him as he tried to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One image captures an attacker launching a flying kick to his victims face who attempts to shield himself from the vicious beating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 20 young men are seen in jostling to attack the victim who is understood to have been killed afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second haunting photograph, captured by an AP reporter, shows the man with his hands tied behind a tree sobbing&nbsp;for his life surrounded by dozens of Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya Muslims, who recently crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh, are continuing to stream across the border following a violent campaign by the Myanmar military, and by Burmese monks according to some reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. officials and others are demanding Myanmar halt what they describe as a campaign of 'ethnic cleansing' that has driven nearly 400,000 Rohingya to flee in the past three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reports, the crisis and refugee exodus began in August when Rohingya insurgents attacked Myanmar police posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar's military retaliated with 'clearance operations' to root out the rebels, but the fleeing Rohingya say Myanmar soldiers shot indiscriminately, burned their homes and warned them to leave or die.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have said they were attacked by Buddhist mobs. Hundreds have died, mostly Rohingya, and some of the refugees have needed treatment for bullet wounds.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar has accused the Rohingya of burning their own homes and villages - a claim the U.N. human rights chief criticised as a 'complete denial of reality.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters at U.N. headquarters on Thursday that 10,000 people reportedly crossed the border in the last 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combined with the Rohingya who fled during the last round of violence in Rakhine state last October, Dujarric said 'it's estimated that some 40 percent of the total Rohingya population have now fled into Bangladesh.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 60 percent of the Rohingya arriving in Bangladesh are children, Dujarric added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Amnesty International said Thursday that it has turned up evidence of an 'orchestrated campaign of systematic burnings' by Myanmar security forces targeting dozens of Rohingya villages over the last three weeks.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two existing refugee camps were packed beyond capacity, and Bangladesh has said it would free land to build a third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the new arrivals were huddling in makeshift shelters along roads or in open fields. Near the camp of Balukhali - where the attack is said to have taken place - some were setting up tents made of bamboo and plastic along hillsides muddy from days of rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE teenager suspected of planting the Parsons Green tube bomb is a refugee from Iraq who came to the UK after his parents were killed, it was claimed last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCTV footage released yesterday shows a man with a Lidl bag like the one containing the bomb which exploded on the train, injuring 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The footage, obtained by ITV, was captured in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With dark collar-length hair, in a maroon cap, he was pictured near the home of his foster parents at 6.50am, just 90 minutes before a fireball ripped through the packed carriage on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sped to the property after an 18-year-old was arrested at 7.50am in Dover port on Saturday morning as he attempted to board a ferry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second suspect, from Syria, aged 21 is believed to have been fostered by the same couple. He was arrested at a takeaway near Heathrow Airport at midnight on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the first suspect had arrived in the UK as a 15-year-old after spending months attempting to smuggle himself in, while living in the notorious makeshift Calais refugee camp known as The Jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee charity is believed to have helped his passage into Britain in 2014 and placed him in foster care with at least two families in Kent, before he moved in with another family in South West London in the past few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative leader of Spelthorne Borough Council Ian Harvey said last night: &quot;One thing I understand is that he was an Iraqi refugee who came here aged 15. His parents died in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penelope and Ronald Jones, aged 71 and 88, who received MBEs from the Queen for services to children and families, took the Iraqi teen into their home after a lifetime devoted to caring for vulnerable children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect, who is being held in custody on suspicion of planting the homemade bucket bomb on the Underground, is said to have had a bust-up with his foster parents two weeks ago after being brought back to the house in Sunbury-upon-Thames in a police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area is just a 37-minute train ride from Wimbledon station, where the Tube that was bombed began its journey. Last night a 21-year-old man, thought to be a Syrian refugee originally from Damascus, was also being interrogated in connection with Friday's attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed the second suspect - who has also not been named - was an asylum seeker from Syria who was also taken in by Mr and Mrs Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is thought to have come to Britain in 2015 and attended a local college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland Yard forensics officers wearing protective overalls, hoods and face masks were inside the Stanwell flat throughout yesterday. It is believed no explosive materials were found there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Builder Dave Solway, 44, who lives opposite Mr and Mrs Jones, told of a row between the 18-year-old suspect and Ron outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lad was out the front shouting and swearing at Ron, telling him he was leaving. I know the couple were at their wits' end, I think they were told he was a lot younger than he is which is why they agreed to take him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poor Ron was trying to get the lad to go in the house but he just kept saying he wanted to leave for London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe this has happened to such nice people, I really feel for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family friend Jim Adaway, 37, said the Joneses had only recently returned to foster caring to help resettle youngsters from overseas, after requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK's threat level has been lowered from critical to severe. Just one person was last night still being treated in hospital following the bomb attempt - for serious wounds to their lower body.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE EUROPEAN Union's executive is preparing to sue Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic after they refused to host asylum-seekers, according to sources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Commission, which is led by Jean-Claude Juncker, is believed to be stepping up a legal case against the trio after they declined to shelter asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three countries have also refused to take in any refugees under the bloc's mandatory quota scheme, disputing the fact it was adopted by a qualified majority vote and citing security concerns.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a drop in the number of refugees seeking asylum in Europe following tighter border controls and a range of EU-funded projects to discourage migration to Europe, the three Eastern European countries have maintained their hardline stance against allowing more migrants to settle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They claim the mainly-Muslim refugees have no place in their predominantly Christian societies and cite security concerns following a series of terror attacks carried out by Islamist militants in western Europe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions between the EU and officials in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are set to soar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unwillingness of the Warsaw, Budapest and Prague governments to host more asylum-seekers has caused tensions with other European leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western nations, some of which are net contributors to the EU budget, have been left infuriated and say Poland, Hungary and Warsaw should have their funding cut until they agree to comply with the rules of the club.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This incendiary approach has in turn enraged Eastern European leaders, who have described such plans as &quot;blackmail&quot; and vowed to fight them tooth and nail.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing and increasingly acrimonious divide between East and West is widely perceived in Brussels to be a much greater threat to the bloc's future than Brexit.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees stand behind a Hungarian border fence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the trio's reluctance to help host migrants from Africa and the Middle East who came to Europe mainly in 2015 has opened a rift with many other European governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include Greece and Italy, two countries that have been the first port of call for refugees and migrants, as well as Germany and other wealthy Western nations that are frequently their preferred final destinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently the most severe punishment the EU can levy on a member state is suspension of its voting rights, but this requires a unanimous vote of the other 27 that is &quot;impossible&quot; to achieve in reality.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eurocrats have also established a Rule of Law framework they can use to address rebellious member states, but its recommendations are &quot;not legally binding and there are no hard incentives for errant member-states to comply&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Centre for European Reform report released last month states: &quot;It cannot be right that the EU is forced by its own rules to subsidise member-states that flout EU values, and in doing so damage their own economic prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungarian PM Viktor Orban is not one of the EU's biggest admirers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apart from moral pressure, the EU's main practical leverage on member-states is financial. The entire EU budget should be linked to European values, amongst them rule of law, since they are the foundation of the Union.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Commission could freeze funds going to a member-state until it implemented adequate policy reforms in line with the recommendations agreed by the Council and the Commission.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It warns: &quot;A rules-based institution cannot tolerate serious breaches of its rules for very long without suffering serious damage. Loyalty to a party grouping can never justify turning a blind eye to violations of the rule of law in a member-state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Threatening sanctions in the form of reduced structural and investment funding from the EU for countries that are turning their back on European values would be a blunt economic instrument. But it should be possible for the EU to devise rules on the use of funds that make safeguarding the rule of law a priority.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Commission is expected to announce the plans to sue Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not Poland's first run-in with the EU - the Warsaw government's plans to overhaul the judiciary were widely condemned by EU leaders, including Polish national Donald&nbsp;Tusk.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a hospital bed in Birmingham where he was convalescing after losing three limbs in an explosion in Afghanistan, photographer Giles Duley watched the war in Syria unfold on the TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that moment in 2011, he realised that documenting the then arising refugee crisis would be the most significant mission of his career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before I got injured my work was documenting the effects of conflict and I was always very focused on the legacy that people lived with after wars,&quot; he explains. &quot;But after I got injured, I really felt that I was living with my own legacy of war and something that I would have for the rest of my life so it became even more important to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Within that I knew that what was happening in Syria was on a scale that was unprecedented.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why I knew it was something that was so important that I would have to be documenting it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tasked with &quot;the greatest brief a photographer can be given: 'follow your heart'&quot; from the UNHCR in 2015, Duley journeyed through 14 countries to capture the desolate and inconceivably treacherous passage awaiting the millions of refugees forced from their homes by the deadly conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He travelled across Europe, including to Greece, Macedonia, Germany, Finland and France, where the refugee crisis was already garnering much media coverage, but always felt it was particularly important to look beyond the continent to the Middle East. It was there, in countries such as Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon, that he could see the impact was being felt more intensely. &quot;Lebanon had a population of five million people and it had more than a million refugees living there,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this point &quot;everybody was covering the story&quot;, detailing the journeys of people crossing borders and the Mediterranean in the hope of finding safety and sanctuary, and a place to temporarily make their home. But that meant Duley could do what he does best and focus on the lesser-known tales of conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admits his photographs of people crossing to Lesbos and walking up to Germany are his &quot;least favourite&quot; of the series because they are the most traditional documentary photographs. They can lack, he says, intimacy and the process means you do not get to know the people because they are constantly moving and transient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt I could do it in a different way,&quot; he says. &quot;I realised my role was to humanise some of the stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything had become about the statistics, the fact that there were millions of refugees and a lot of scenes of mass exodus, people in their thousands, things like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to break it down to families and individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My work has always been that, always been about the little intimacies within one family and I didn't think that was coming across. That's why I wanted to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of this, is Duley's awareness of the ongoing narrative for the people he documents and forms bonds with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He quickly became conscious of the fact that stories do not end when he leaves and wraps up a project - for the subjects, a photographer's presence would typically be a fleeting moment of distraction before the irrepressible feeling of needing to survive while in a perpetual state of uncertainty goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people we document, their stories continue and one of the things that I've become increasingly interested in is going back and revisiting families, especially for refugees because the reality is that they are stuck in limbo and their lives don't move forward,&quot; he says. &quot;That in a sense is the story, the fact that nothing changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of newspapers, magazines and media outlets, they're not really interested in that, they would say, 'Why would you go back? You've already done that story'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have that freedom and the ability to be able to go back over various times and I think it's one of the most important elements of my work to tell that story again and again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reinforces the fact that nothing changes for the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some of the images, you can see the kids growing up and you can see them at different points in their lives - and you can really get that sense of how hard it can be to imagine what that's like over three, four, five years in a camp for those children growing up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes it is painful to witness stories evolve, and the saddest thing Duley says he has seen in terms of change when returning to visit families is the darkness that descends on them when they lose hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explains: &quot;At the beginning people were always saying to me, 'we'll go back to Syria in six months', and then 'we'll go back next year', and then people started to change and started to say, 'we'll never go back because the country is destroyed'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember one of the refugees I photographed on a train in Macedonia and I asked him why he left, because his family was still in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said, 'I was the first to lose hope'. I think that's a really powerful idea that actually hope is what keeps people going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarkable hope displayed by some of the people Duley met during this work had a profound impact on him, during even some of the most distressing times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was while visiting a hospital in Iraq run by medial NGO Emergency, for which he is a trustee, that he chanced upon one of the brightest glimmers of hope that shone from within the darkest depths of the unimaginable heartbreak and destruction left in the path of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of all the trips I've done, covering I don't know how many different conflicts and certainly the effects of so many different conflicts, I can't think of any other experience that I found more upsetting than going to Emergency's hospital in Irbil,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amount of civilians being brought in from Mosul was on a scale like I've never seen, and I've never seen so many families absolutely destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was left feeling completely and utterly overwhelmed and I always try to see the positive when I'm doing a story and create dignity, but in that hospital I just felt devastated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt really negative about everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was some of the injured children there that were the ones that broke me out of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In particular there was one ward where there were two young boys who'd lost their legs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were both affected in different ways; one of them wasn't eating and was very depressed so every day I would go to sit on his bed and eat with him. We'd just share a meal to slowly encourage him to eat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then one day they started playing some music on their phones and one of the songs was called 'Take me back to Mosul'. The reality for most of the refugees forced from their homes by conflict is that they just want to go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were playing this song and as I was taking a photograph of the young boy he did the V for victory with his fingers and it just reminded me again that even in the worst times, even when you think all hope is lost, the human spirit is incredible and people will always find a way to rebuild their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The resilience of these people is what inspires me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have my own personal experience of losing three limbs, being stuck in a hospital and I remember at times thinking if I would ever work again, ever do anything, and it's amazing what the human spirit can achieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In that moment I would say covering the fighting in Mosul was the darkest time for me as a photographer in terms of being overcome and overwhelmed by tragedy but it was the spirit of the patients that I was photographing that gave me hope again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duley's own hope for his work is that everyone will recognise there is always some kind of helpful action that can be taken that will have a huge impact on others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very easy to feel overwhelmed by all the stories of refugees and it's very easy to think there's nothing you can do,&quot; he says. &quot;But it's my belief that each one of us can do something positive and through that can create ripples that will affect other people's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The one thing I would say is even if it is something small, you can do something and you can help and we all need to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giles Duley's photography will be on display at the exhibition 'I can only tell you what my eyes see' at The Old Truman Brewery, London until tomorrow and then at the Triennale Museum, Milano from 24 October to 12 November and at Casa Emergency, Via Santa Croce, 19 - 20122 from 27 October to 24 November</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Supreme Court partially lifted preliminary injunctions that had blocked President Trump's revised executive order suspending US entry by foreign nationals from six, rather than the previous seven, mostly Muslim countries. However, the Court carved out an exception for foreign nationals who have a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot; with a person or entity in the United States,&quot; raising such questions as &quot;What is a bona fide relationship?&quot; and &quot;What is an entity in the US?&quot; that will likely be the subject of further court action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court allows travel ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Supreme Court partially lifted preliminary injunctions that had blocked Executive Order No. 13780, signed by President Donald J. Trump in March 2017 (EO-2), banning travel to the US for citizens of six countries. The Supreme Court scheduled a full hearing of the case for October 2017.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bona fide relationship&quot; exception</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court found that the preliminary injunction shall remain in place and the travel ban will not impact foreign nationals who have a &quot;bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.&quot; Further, refugees will continue to be allowed to enter the US, subject to the 50,000 person cap on refugee admissions, except that the cap cannot be used as a means to bar an individual with a bona fide relationship with the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court defined &quot;bona fide relationship&quot; as either (with respect to individuals) &quot;a close familial relationship&quot; or (with respect to entities), a relationship that is &quot;formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course.&quot; What constitutes a sufficiently close familial relationship is likely to be the subject of further court action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for what constitutes a sufficiently established relationship with an entity, the Supreme Court provided three examples:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Students admitted to attend university in the USWorkers who have accepted an offer of employment from a US companyLecturers invited to the US for a speaking engagement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The travel ban will apply to individuals whose relationship with an entity was formed to purposefully circumvent the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is worth noting that EO-2 in its original form applies only to the new issuance of visas, and not the US entry of individuals who have already been issued visas, green cards or asylum/refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, there is a chance that the Supreme Court will not have to hear the case in its entirety in October. If EO-2 goes into effect as scheduled by the Trump administration, the 90 day temporary ban will conclude at the end of September, several days before the Supreme Court begins its term. This would, then, remove any controversy over the legality of that piece of the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens from these countries impacted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens from the following countries are detrimentally impacted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IranLibyaSomaliaSudanSyriaYemen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EO-2 does not apply to citizens of other countries who merely visited the listed countries. Further, it does not apply to citizens of these six countries who are dual citizens and use the passport of a non-affected country to apply for a visa and enter the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When does the ban start?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a June 14 memorandum, President Trump directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of State and other relevant agencies to wait 72 hours from the release of the Supreme Court decision before banning refugees and travelers from the six affected countries to &quot;ensure an orderly and proper implementation&quot; of the changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his first six months in office, President Trump signed two travel ban executive orders. The first, Executive Order 13797 (EO-1), issued on January 27, 2017, took a number of steps, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suspending for 90 days the entry of foreign nationals from seven mostly Muslim countries identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel in the US </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c24"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspending for 120 days the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), during which an adequacy review is to be undertakenReducing to 50,000 per year the total number of refugees that could be admitted to the United States, starting in fiscal year 2017Suspending indefinitely admission of refugees from Syria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EO-1 was quickly blocked  by the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, which issued a nationwide temporary restraining order. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied an emergency motion by the US government to stay the district court order pending appeal. In response, the government rescinded EO-1 and went back to the drawing board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 6, 2017, President Trump signed EO-2, which closely mirrored the directives in EO-1, but was intended to correct some its perceived errors, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reducing the reach of the 90-day temporary suspension of entry to foreign nationals from six (rather than seven) mostly Muslim countries, with Iraq no longer included </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c24"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and with a case-by-case waiver of the entry bar.Directing the Secretary of DHS to undertake a 20-day global review of whether foreign governments provide sufficient information about nationals applying for visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EO-2 was immediately challenged in court, which challenges led to prompt nationwide preliminary injunctions by the US District Court for the District of Maryland and (as stated above) the Western District of Washington, which were then appealed to the US Courts of Appeal for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fourth Circuit concluded that the EO-2 ban on entry from the six named countries was primarily motivated by religious considerations and, as such, violated the First Amendment. In that case, the preliminary injunction only applied to the suspension of entry of foreign nationals from particular countries. The 120-day ban on USRAP and the quota on total refugee immigration would still be in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ninth Circuit, meanwhile, found that EO-2 exceeded the president's authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and, on that basis, upheld the injunction with regard to the entirety of EO-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government appealed both decision to the Supreme Court, certiorari was granted, and the two cases were consolidated and oral argument scheduled for October Term 2017. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, heard the government's application to stay the aforementioned injunctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by privately-owned Burundian Radio Isanganiro on 28 July</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Presenter] The Independent National Commission on Human Rights in Burundi (CNIDH) has said it is pleased with the current human rights situation in Burundi. In a press statement published earlier on Friday [28 July], the head of the Independent National Commission on Human Rights in Burundi (CNIDH), Jean Baptiste Baribonekeza, said they were pleased with the way Burundi refugees were getting ready to go back home. They [CNIDH] requested the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to help in facilitating those willing to come back home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Independent National Commission on Human Rights in Burundi (CNIDH) criticised incidents of killings that happened in the month of July in different parts of the country. Among the things that the commission has requested is that the International Criminal Court stops its preliminary investigation into the situation in Burundi and alleged human rights abuse in the country [launched on 25 April 2016]. Here's Jean Baptiste Baribonekeza the head of The Independent National Commission on Human Rights in Burundi (CNIDH)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Baribonekeza] The Independent National Commission on Human Rights in Burundi (CNIDH) is pleased with the security and human rights situation today because it is evident that it has now improved throughout the country. The CNIDH commission well received the news that there are over 43,000 Burundian refugees who have requested to be brought back to their motherland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNIDH commission condemns rampant killings that took place in the month of July 2017 where wrongdoers launched grenade attacks at Gatara in [northern province of] Kayanza, Bugabira in Kirundo province and Bwiza [place] in the capital, Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are happy with the progress of discussions between politicians and calls upon [word indistinct] to continue with more determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNIDH commission is concerned about some decisions by some of Burundi's friends, to impose sanctions against the government of Burundi and put the country under pressure for reasons that are not clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNIDH commission believes the crimes that were committed in Burundi do not exceed the capacity of Burundi's justice institutions. Looking at the current situation, CNIDH makes the following recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. To the government of Burundi: To continue making the best decisions in restoring peace and security in the country as a whole, and to continue with proper plans for development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. To the Judiciary: We recommend them to continue looking into the cases that have been submitted to them about allegations of violation of human rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. To the International Criminal Court: we recommend that they stop the preliminary examination on the situation in Burundi which started on 25 April 2016. Instead, they should allow the Burundi's justice institutions to do its own investigation into alleged crimes committed in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. To the international community: we recommend that they continue to support ongoing dialogues between politicians and to help the parties involved to reach an agreement as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNIDH requests the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to work with the Burundian government as well as the countries hosting Burundian refugees so as to make it easy for all Burundian refugees wishing to return home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">547 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education International calls on governments, the United Nations and other intergovernmental organisations and stakeholders to defend and promote the rights of all migrants and refugees.<BR><BR>Education International (EI) particularly urges governments to ensure full respect for the human, trade union and education rights of migrant children, teachers and education support personnel. Rising xenophobia, racism and discrimination, as well as the unprecedented scale of human displacement during recent years highlight the urgent need for a global commitment to fair migration and coherent, rights-based policies. The recent revelations concerning the enslavement of migrants and refugees in Libya is a wake-up call for the UN and governments to take immediate action to guarantee the protection and safety of migrants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Global Compact on Safe, Regular, and Orderly Migration, to be adopted by member states next year, represents a historic opportunity to address these issues. Education International insists that migrant and refugee workers and children's rights should be fully reflected in the Global Compact.<BR><BR>Ensure implementation of UN and ILO Conventions on Migration<BR><BR>Governments should ratify and implement the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and ILO migration conventions, thus ensuring that migrant workers have the same rights, terms and employment conditions as local workers, including freedom of association, the right to organize and collective bargaining.<BR><BR>&quot;The Global Compact should be rooted in existing human rights treaties,&quot; said EI General Secretary, Fred van Leeuwen. Van Leeuwen insisted that UN Covenants, Conventions and other instruments are applicable to all human beings, including migrants.<BR><BR>Address the root causes of migration<BR><BR>Education International insists that governments must address the root causes of migration such as global imbalances in economic development, poverty, political instability, conflict, unemployment and climate change. &quot;Addressing these factors will ensure that migration becomes an option rather than a necessity for the majority of migrants and refugees&quot;, opines Van Leeuwen.<BR><BR>Ensure access to quality education and other public services<BR><BR>EI calls on governments of transit and destination countries to ensure the right to free quality education for all migrant children, youth and adults. In addition to basic and post-basic education, migrants should have access to quality early childhood, language and technical, vocational education and training programmes.<BR><BR>&quot;Particular measures should be taken to enable unaccompanied minors and undocumented children to have access to qualify education,&quot; stressed van Leeuwen.<BR><BR>Destination country governments should also recognise the qualifications of migrants, including those of migrant and refugee teachers as an important pathway to employment and decent work, he continued.<BR><BR>Today, EI's Dennis Sinyolo is at the UN participating in the third multi-stakeholder hearing on the Global Compact. He will be calling on the UN and its member states to put education, teachers, education support personnel and children's rights at the core of the Global Compact on Migration.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITAIN will spend &pound;1.9 billion of foreign aid cash in just five years looking after asylum seekers and refugees, figures show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount the Home Office plans to shell out could fund 82,745 new police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wants to maintain the current level of support given to those seeking refuge in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it has already told the Daily Express the &quot;majority&quot; of the &pound;362 million it contributes to the bloated budget each year is swallowed up supporting migrants. But projected spending on Official Development Assistance (ODA) until 2021 means taxpayers will continue to shoulder the burden of &quot;refugee programmes&quot;, providing bed and board for tens of thousands of newcomers, many of whom have arrived here illegally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggling The billions of pounds of public money spent on ODA has prompted 70,000 Daily Express readers to back our Stop The Foreign Aid Madness Crusade demanding the Government urgently redirects money into struggling frontline services such as the NHS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK is committed to spending 0.7 per cent of our national income on foreign aid. Last year it cost taxpayers &pound;13.3 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But cross-party concern has been raised that it is being used to support economic migrants and not those in genuine need of sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukip deputy leader Margot Parker said: &quot;For this amount of taxpayers' cash to be paying for asylum seekers almost beggars belief. The Government should stop this cavalier squandering of our cash. There is a Budget coming up - let's see some action to scale back on this spending and use the money to cure many of the problems facing the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday managers of hospital and ambulance trusts across England claimed staff shortages in the overrun NHS pose a serious risk to patient safety and quality of care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NHS is on the cusp of a recruitment crisis with an estimated shortage of at least 50,000 doctors and nurses. Our campaign is calling for money to be redirected into the services on which millions of people rely but which teeter on the brink of collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MP David Davies said: &quot;Far too many economic migrants are trying to come to the UK simply for a better life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wants money spent on asylum seekers directed to refugee camps across North Africa to discourage thousands from risking their lives trying to reach Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents show planned spending on ODA would see the Home Office fork out &pound;1.94 billion to &quot;maintain the current refugee programmes and provide assistance on new areas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department, run by Home Secretary Amber Rudd and responsible for securing our borders from illegal immigration, confirmed the lion's share of its foreign aid commitment is spent on asylum support and the Syrian Vulnerable People Resettlement Scheme. The scheme aims to relocate 20,000 Syrian refugees from camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt and Turkey by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even those who have reached the UK illegally are provided with a place to live, a cash allowance or both while claims are processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current rules see each individual pocket &pound;36.95 a week with those who have been refused asylum getting &pound;35.39 on a payment card for food, clothing and toiletries. Claimants also get free NHS treatment while their children are found school places and given free meals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office said: &quot;The UK has a long and proud history of granting asylum to those who genuinely need our protection.&quot; It added that more than 8,500 people had been resettled so far - half of whom were children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said: &quot;We also support projects to build the capacity and capability of countries to deal with border security, drug smuggling, modern slavery and child protection online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is in our interest to help tackle these issues abroad so as to lessen their impact in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Lingering woes. Money-changer exchanges currency for custo&shy;mers at the main market at al-Zaatari refugee camp in the city of Mafraq. (Reuters)  The Arab Weekly<BR>Roufan Nahhas  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amman - Jordan has been battered by economic and social woes caused by tax increases, the rise of commodity prices, the heavy toll of hosting refugees and higher government expenditures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2018 draft budget previews a cash subsidy of $241 million to compensate for the rise in the cost of living caused by the govern&shy;ment's decision to lift subsidies on several basic commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cash subsidy is destined to Jordanian families with to&shy;tal annual income not exceeding $17,000 and individuals with an&shy;nual income less than $8,000. Beneficiaries should not own land or real estate valued at more than $423,000 and more than one vehi&shy;cle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 5 million Jordanians are expected to benefit from the subsidy, the government said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite official expectations for a better economy in 2018 support&shy;ed by a strategy to expand to new markets, Jordanians are feeling the brunt of stagnation. The hike in prices compounded with an un&shy;employment rate of 18.2% in the first quarter of 2017 -- the highest in 25 years -- reduced purchasing power considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhannad Shehadeh, minis&shy;ter of State for Investment Affairs and president of the Investment Commission, said the panel was working on a new strategy aimed at attracting investment and iden&shy;tifying the opportunities and ad&shy;vantages that Jordan offers to local and foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy would seek to es&shy;tablish Jordan as a centre for the provision of services for regional and international businesses and a hub for reconstruction of Syria. It previews strengthening exports, opening new markets for Jorda&shy;nian products, developing the tourism sector and reinforcing the technology sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this year's 'Ease of Doing Business' report by the World Bank, Jordan has jumped 15 places to reach 103rd position, which is a positive indicator that reflects an improvement in the investment environment in the kingdom,&quot; Shehadeh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan is also eyeing new mar&shy;kets for Jordanian exports in Af&shy;rica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an opportunity to en&shy;ter these markets and attract in&shy;vestments that will help create job opportunities,&quot; Shehadeh added in a meeting with Jordanian busi&shy;nessmen heading to Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax increases of up to 16% on many commodities, including dairy products, and the removal of the state subsidy on bread is se&shy;verely affecting the daily life of the poor and middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of the economy has forced many businesses to be shuttered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jordan Chamber of Com&shy;merce said approximately 70 clothes factories, including ten Jordanian establishments, aban&shy;doned the Jordanian market for Egypt in the last three years, at&shy;tracted by better opportunities for investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not the first time some&shy;thing like this takes place,&quot; said Asad Qawasmi, who represents the clothes and garment industry in the chamber. &quot;Real estate com&shy;panies did the same by choosing Egypt, which offers many advan&shy;tages, including tax exemption, one window system and cheap labour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jordan ended up importing goods produced by these factories while it was better and easier to keep them here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordanian garment imports from Egypt increased 50% in the last three years. In the last eight months, the bill totalled $226.8 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fashion is not a priority for the average Jordanian, however. Fi&shy;nancial burdens and increased prices led to a drop in purchasing power to a point that some fami&shy;lies just manage with what they have or seek second-hand clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have absolutely no choice. The second-hand markets provide better prices and sell important brands so you buy a brand for less and this is an excellent way to save some money,&quot; said Khalil, a buyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, buying clothes is con&shy;sidered a luxury. I have four chil&shy;dren who go to school so you can imagine the cost of raising and feeding them and with the in&shy;crease in prices things become a heavy burden on any employee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan has been reeling under the burden of hosting Syrian refu&shy;gees for the past six years. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said Jordan is the second largest refu&shy;gee-hosting country in the world relative to its population. There are 657,000 Syrian refugees regis&shy;tered with the UNHCR but the ac&shy;tual number is believed to be more than 1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is like rubbing salt in the wound,&quot; said journalist Ziad Momani, describing the refugee situation. &quot;Since the war (in Syria) started, hosting refugees has cost us more than $10 billion covering health care, education, employ&shy;ment and other services. I know it is part of a humanitarian action but still, it has had a very negative effect on the society and the coun&shy;try.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Monetary Fund said Jordanian government expenditures were estimated to reach $12.3 billion by the end of 2017, compared to $11.2 billion in 2016.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Christmas Day, marked four months since the start of the latest influx of Rohingya into Bangladesh from Myanmar. An estimated 830,000 people - seven times the population of my Edmonton constituency - now live on the border. More arrive every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one month, half a million arrived. That is the highest monthly exodus of refugees anywhere on the planet since the Rwandan genocide. M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res has documented at least 6,700 deaths from violence, but the real number is likely to be much higher. The world is outraged at the savagery of the atrocities, at the sexual violence, at the torture, at the discrimination and at the sheer impunity of General Min Aung Hlaing and the failure of Myanmar's military leaders to face consequences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for all the outrage, the world has not done nearly enough. A long-term political solution will require much more. Earlier this month, Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee passed judgement on what else the UK Government could have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are immediate and massive humanitarian needs that risk being forgotten as the news cycle moves on. A recent International Rescue Committee assessment found that 95 per cent of people are drinking untreated water, risking a cholera outbreak. Nearly 60 million litres of safe water - the equivalent of 23 Olympic-sized swimming pools - are needed every day; 40 per cent of children are currently malnourished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women are in particular danger: horrific accounts continue to emerge of systematic rape, abuse and torture at the hands of the Myanmar military, while there is only limited support for recovery and treatment in the camps. Access to even basic healthcare and education is severely restricted. Shelter needs too are acute: camps sprang up rapidly, without sufficient planning or space to expand. Hundreds of thousands will sleep in 2018 crowded under tarpaulins propped up by bamboo sticks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plight of the Rohingya began long before August, and there is no quick end in sight. The chances are that whole generations will now spend their lives in Bangladesh as refugees. That is why the medium-term response in Bangladesh matters so much. International donors have already pledged some $344m (&pound;257m) towards the response. That includes &pound;59m from the UK - our aid provision has been both swift and generous. But governments and international institutions must now step up in the months ahead, and agree a much bigger financial package with Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That support must be tied to a progressive refugee policy that will provide refugees with access to work, education, citizenship rights and a future, without putting further strain on already stretched public services. There are important lessons to learn from similar influxes in Uganda, Jordan, and Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But right now, that progressive, positive, outcome looks a long way away for the Rohingya. Rather than welcome and integrate, the government of Bangladesh is now activating a costly plan to transfer 100,000 Rohingya to Bhashan Char, a currently uninhabited island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of November, the governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar also agreed to return and repatriate Rohingya to Myanmar - the very country they fled just weeks ago - with support from the UK and other countries. It is reported that repatriation and refugee returns could start as soon as January, just a few weeks away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Government says it is seeking assurances that repatriations will only happen if they are safe, voluntary and dignified. But according to human rights groups surveying refugees on the ground, many neither want to return nor believe it is yet safe to do so. That is hardly surprising when you consider their horrific experience at the hands of the military, or that a repeat cycle of counter-insurgency human rights violations is highly likely in future. We now know that the assurances of civilian leaders like Aung Sang Suu Kyi count for little in a country still dominated by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the UK Government receives far stronger and more credible assurances and evidence that any returns will indeed be safe, voluntary and dignified, and until UN agencies have full confidence in the arrangement, the UK must not support an agreement that could put thousands more Rohingya lives in serious danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four months on from the start of the crisis, we should focus not on how the Rohingya can be sent back, but on how we can help provide short-term help, and long-term sanctuary. The UK must help the Rohingya, not send them back into danger.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump pleaded with Mexico's president to stop saying that he would not pay for a border wall and struggled to grasp how a refugee swap deal with Australia worked, an unprecedented leak of transcripts of presidential phone calls has revealed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of Mr Trump's calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia caused consternation after they were leaked from an apparently tight circle within the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transcripts show the president in his first week struggling to reconcile his campaign promises with the realities of governing, and the contrasting efforts of two heads of government to bend him to their will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a call with President Pe&ntilde;a Nieto of Mexico, Mr Trump describes his vow to make Mexico pay for a border wall as a growing political problem, and begs Mr Pe&ntilde;a Nieto to &quot;stop talking about the wall&quot;. The Mexican president has repeatedly said that Mexico will not pay for the wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You cannot say that to the press,&quot; Mr Trump says. &quot;We should both say, 'We will work it out'. It will work out in the formula somehow.&quot; Mr Trump veers between sweet talk and invective, blaming Mexico for America's drug epidemic but saying: &quot;It is you and I against the world, Enrique, do not forget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump's phone call with Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, was more extraordinary still. There were reports soon after the call in late January that the conversation had turned fractious, which Mr Trump denied. The transcripts confirm the re-ports. The conversation quickly becomes bogged down in the details of a deal, struck under the Obama administration, for the US to take 1,250 refugees who had attempted to reach Australia by boat. Australia is to take in Costa Ricans seeking asylum in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia does not admit any refugees or migrants who reach its shores by boat in an effort to deter people smuggling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump struggles to understand the deal despite Mr Turnbull's repeated efforts to explain it. Mr Trump had just issued the first of his executive orders seeking to ban migrants and refugees from a number of Muslim countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull explains that the deal covers economic refugees from none of the banned countries, and that the US can vet and turn away any it believes are dangerous. He adds they have not been detained because they are crimi-nals but because of Australia's policy. Mr Trump is unconvinced. &quot;I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad,&quot; he said. &quot;That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.&quot; He goes on: &quot;What is the thing with boats?&quot; Mr Turnbull refuses to budge and the phone call ends in acrimony, according to the leaked transcripts, which were first reported by The Washington Post. &quot;I have had it,&quot; Mr Trump fumes. &quot;I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-six-year-old Alaa Allssa is one of the estimated 44,000 Syrian war refugees seeking sanctuary in Germany, and he has scant regard for the drive by Angela Merkel's governing coalition to entice migrants to go back to their home countries with cash handouts from the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not difficult to understand why. Mr Allssa, a spiky-haired chemistry graduate, fled to Germany via the Balkans with his wife and two young children in 2015. He comes from the eastern Syrian city of Deir ez-Zor, which was an Isis stronghold until the US-backed Syrian forces retook it last month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google Maps' photos of Deir ez-Zor show nothing but rubble heaps. About 93,000 civilians were trapped in a pocket in the city for three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people living in my home town right now are in constant fear of being attacked by Isis missiles fired from outside the town,&quot; Mr Allssa told i last week as he stood outside a vast container village on Berlin's former Tempelhof airport, which now houses refugees. &quot;Do the Germans think that money is going to persuade me and my family to go back?&quot; Mr Allssa's point cannot be easily dismissed. Ms Merkel's controversial open-door refugee policy enabled nearly a million migrants to enter Germany in late 2015. Thousands of them were Syrian war refugees, but last year only 22 volunteered to return home to the mere handful of areas in Syria deemed at least partially safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Germany's open-door refugee policy resulted in big losses for the ruling conservative Christian Democrat and Social Democrat coalition partners in September's general election. Almost 13 per cent of the vote went to the new right-wing, anti-migrant Alternative for Germany party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Ms Merkel, who is still struggling to form a new government in the wake of her party's electoral losses, is under pressure to show that they are doing all they can to encourage the departure of Germany's 230,000 rejected asylum-seekers who have little or no chance of being given permanent residence in their host country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in this group come from Balkan countries and Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Ms Merkel's caretaker government upped cash handouts to migrants prepared to voluntarily return home to Euro 1,000 (&pound;889) per applicant and up to Euro 6,000 per family. Additional money is also available to help returnees settle in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The offer runs until the end of February, and critics see the deadline as an attempt to get migrants to jump at the money and go home before it expires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For all those who have no prospect of remaining in Germany, voluntary repatriation is a far better option than deportation,&quot; Ms Merkel's conservative interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, said last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany has been funding the voluntary return of migrants for several years. Last year, figures reached a peak when 55,000 returned home voluntarily. More than half were given cash handouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system has an added - yet controversial - incentive: the sooner a migrant with little or no chance of obtaining asylum applies to voluntarily return home, the greater his or her chances are of obtaining financial help. Would-be returnees have to promise they will not launch a legal appeal if their asylum claim is rejected. Only half of the money is paid in Germany. The rest when the returnee is back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This practice has been sharply criticised by refugee support and welfare groups such as Germany's Pro Asyl organisation. They say the scheme puts pressure on migrants to go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this way people are being seduced in the basest manner into not pursuing their legal rights,&quot; says G&uuml;nter Burkhardt, Pro-Asyl's director. He believes the government's decision to put an end-of-February deadline puts the kind of pressure on asylum-seekers that could result in their making the wrong decision. Critics also argue that the cash handouts are an attempt to reduce &quot;negative publicity&quot; heaped on the German government for its policy of forcibly deporting failed asylum-seekers to questionably &quot;safe&quot; home countries such as Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Germany expelled 25,000 failed asylum-seekers. Most were returned to their homes in Balkan countries. But German civil aviation pilots refused to fly 222 planned deportation flights to Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many ex-migrants, cashfunded homecoming appears to work. The International Organisation for Migration, which organises cash-funded returnee schemes, cites former refugees such as Methak B - a 33-year-old Iraqi citizen who fled to Germany in 2012 with his wife and two-yearold son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Methak and his wife had expected life in Germany to be easier and were plagued by homesickness. When his wife became pregnant again, the family applied to return home. They were helped with government handouts and a reintegration programme for northern Iraq, which enabled Methak to start a stationery shop in the centre of his home city of Erbil. He is now planning a second store and hopes soon to buy a house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marion Lich, who heads the Munich-based returnee agency Coming Home, says many migrants who flee to Germany with high expectations have little chance of finding their feet in their chosen country of exile. Even if they eventually obtain asylum, many migrants feel estranged in Germany for years, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They suffer painful bouts of homesickness and see their lives unfolding without them getting anywhere. Going home is often the last resort but in the end it can heal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during press conference</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal includes the departure of all Nusra Front militants from Lebanon's border region around the town of Arsal, along with any civilians in nearby refugee camps who wish to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truce echoes deals struck within Syria in which Damascus has shuttled rebels and civilians to Idlib province and other opposition areas. Such evacuations have helped President Bashar al-Assad recapture several rebel bastions over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon's Hezbollah has played a major role in fighting militants along the frontier during Syria's six-year war, sending thousands of combatants to support Assad's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Hezbollah took most of the mountainous zone of Jroud Arsal in a joint offensive with the Syrian army to drive Nusra militants from their last frontier foothold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nusra Front was al-Qaeda's Syria branch until it severed ties and rebranded last year. It now spearheads the Tahrir al-Sham Islamist alliance in the Syrian war.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lebanese army, which receives considerable US and British military support, did not take an active part in the operation, setting up defensive positions around Arsal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next phase is expected to target a nearby enclave currently in the hands of Islamic State jihadists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Buses that will transport Nusra Front militants and their families have started arriving in Jroud Arsal,&quot; the military media unit run by the Iran-backed Hezbollah said via social media on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convoys rolled in from Syria and headed towards Lebanese army positions. Syrian Red Crescent ambulances arrived on the opposite side of the frontier, the media unit said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footage from the border zone showed dozens of white buses driving through the barren hills. The Lebanese Red Cross has taken part in logistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step of the ceasefire, brokered by Lebanon's internal security agency, unfolded on Sunday as the two sides exchanged the bodies of dead fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Lebanese security source said 200 militants with hundreds of their family members, as well as more than 5,000 refugees, were due to leave, mostly towards insurgent-held Idlib.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nusra Front will release eight Hezbollah fighters under the deal, three captured in recent days and five held in Syria, a Lebanese security source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hezbollah's al-Manar TV said the two sides would swap Nusra militants for the Hezbollah hostages near the city of Aleppo, which the Syrian government controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNrefugee agency, not involved in the deal, was trying to reach refugees in the Arsal region to evaluate whether returns were voluntary, spokeswoman Lisa Abou Khaled said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UNHCR believes that conditions for refugees to return in safety and dignity are not yet in place in Syria,&quot; she said, with war continuing across large swathes of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The multi-sided Syrian conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven at least 11 million from their homes - about half Syria's pre-war population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 1.5 million refugees have poured into Lebanon - around a quarter of its population - where most languish in severe poverty. Several thousand live in makeshift camps east of Arsal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO years after the first Syrian refugee families arrived in Ashford, the borough council has revealed how they have made their lives in the Kent town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warm welcome afforded to the borough's 15 families has been heartwarming, says the council, and the families themselves are overwhelmed by  response from the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the first three families arrived in Ashford in December 2015 from camps along the Syrian border, the council said that its key emphasis in  managing this project was integration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are now 71 Syrians who have been accepted as part of the national   resettlement programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashford was one of the first towns to respond to the Government's programme and worked closely with the UNHCR and the Home Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obvious barriers to their integration are their lack of language skills to begin with, and their dependence on public transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, four men and one of the women have passed their driving theory tests -  a significant achievement as the test has to be taken in English - and one of the four men has passed his practical examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four  men have  achieved a CSCS (construction skills certification scheme) qualification, relating to health and safety in the workplace, which could enable them to work on construction projects in the borough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other  men have permanent jobs doing custom car-chroming and tyre fitting and one has taken a work placement in an Ashford barber shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One individual, who had no English language skills when he arrived in December 2015, was   among the first intake at the new Ashford College in Station Road. He is studying English, Mathematics and Information Technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man  has also been working in manufacturing establishments following his  enrolment with a job agency in Ashford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary Amber Rudd visited Ashford in March   and saw a project at Concept Training in South Ashford   offering the men - who are   traditionally  the heads of their households - a wide range of emotional, language and career support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar projects are now being rolled out in Hampshire, Sussex and on the Isle of Wight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a new course for the Syrian women with preschool children has begun, allowing them to take eight hours of English language learning per week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight of the women are now attending projects to give them food hygiene training as well as food health and safety advice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council says this is with a view to them possibly opening a caf&Atilde;&copy;  within the centre for  families who will  attend the training in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, a space will also be provided to serve as  a beauty room in the training centre and the women will be trained to cut hair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the council's Syrian families have engaged in the projects and there are other projects that will be revealed in 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council is now appealing for more properties in the private sector to come forward so that it can continue to meet its commitment of resettling more Syrian refugee families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close partnership working has also been key on this project. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisations such as The Prince's Trust, Ashford Volunteer Bureau, Adult Education and many Ashford community and faith groups have opened their doors to help support the families and assist them in rebuilding their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anne Forbes, Ashford Borough Council's Syrian Resettlement Co-ordinator, said: &quot;Our Syrian refugees are amazing, resilient people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dealing with them has been a joy and a pleasure, not to mention a truly humbling experience. I have learnt so much from them, even though the main element of my role is to encourage the families and enable them to learn from me about daily life in the borough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are extremely hard working people who are eager to establish themselves and stand on their own two feet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That so many of them have not only found their feet but are contributing to their communities is so pleasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I trust that the many volunteers who came forward initially, who contacted the council to say how pleased they were that we were taking this positive stance as part of the government programme, will be pleased to receive this update.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councillor Gerry Clarkson, leader of Ashford Borough Council, added: &quot;Taking such an active stance in our participation in the national government's resettlement programme was absolutely the right thing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must all remember that these are genuine refugees from a war-torn area and not economic migrants. We have a moral and international duty to assist these refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am pleased that the refugees have embraced Ashford as their home and are really taking the opportunities presented to them through their efforts to integrate in their new communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We market Ashford as an international town so it was natural for us to extend the arm of friendship to these families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are proud to have them in our borough and once again thank the many people and organisations within those communities who have done so much to make these families feel welcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence erupted in the western Rakhine state just over a week ago when the government of Burma, also known as Myanmar, claimed it was cracking down on insurgents following an attack on police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Rohingyaaccused security officials and Buddhist mobs of burning their villages down - leaving them forced to flee across the border to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 400 people are believed to have been killed in the violent clashes, with a further 40,000 fleeing the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insurgent group that claimed responsibility for last week's attacks, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), said it acted to protect Rohingya communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is nearly impossible to verify information issued by either the government or Rohingya sympathisers because the government has barred most journalists from the area, except on limited official guided tours.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Afghan refugee accused of deliberately running over shoppers in Melbourne has been taken for police interrogation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saeed Noori hid his face with his cuffed hands while sitting between two detectives as he was driven from Melbourne Police Station to the Custody Centre below the city's Magistrates Court on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 32-year-old spent the previous 24 hours under police guard in hospital after ploughing a white Suzuki Vitara into 17 pedestrians outside Flinders Street Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to investigators from his hospital bed, he made&nbsp;a 'number of utterances' and 'spoke about dreams and voices'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He also attributed some of his actions to the poor treatment of Muslims,' Acting Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said on Friday morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives were not able to interview him earlier due to his injuries caused by the crash and a struggle with an off-duty police sergeant who heroically wrestled him from the car before other officers arrested him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patton said there were no signs in Norri's online activity that he planned the attack in advance, and that counter-terrorism specialists did not believe it was a terrorist attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not rule out terrorism but said: 'We haven't seen any warning signs that there was any threat of violence.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noori has a history of drug use and mental illness and reportedly suffered an addiction to ice, a highly purified form of methamphetamine which can cause depression and anxiety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators are still searching for a motive for Noori's alleged 'evil act' and hope a formal interview, likely followed by criminal charges, would shed some light.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police raided two homes in Heidelberg West - where Noori lives - and Oak Park in Melbourne's north on Thursday night, hours after the terrifying incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family members present were reportedly cooperatives as forensics teams seized electronic items from the homes that police will comb through for clues about Noori's motives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At this stage nothing has been found to indicate a linkage to extremism, a terrorist organisation or anything of a terrorist nature,' police told Daily Mail Australia on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noori&nbsp;arrived in Australia as a refugee in 2004 through a resettlement program, and had several run-ins with the law between 2008 and earlier this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At this stage, because investigations are continuing, apart from that statement, there are no known links to any political issues or any, certainly any links to extremist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Therefore, the position I am advised off at the moment is that no terrorism link has been identified at this stage. I want to stress, there is a mass of material that is being investigated and nothing should be ruled out, nothing should be ruled out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in June this year he was convicted and fined $1000 after pleading guilty to driving while unlicensed, using a mobile phone while driving, and failing to answer bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missing bail charge was from when he missed a court date for the driving offences, which occurred either early this year or late last year, and which he also faced court for in February.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nineteen people were injured in the incident, including the driver and an off-duty policeman who heroically wrestled Noori from the car as other officers arrested him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">930 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the social and adaptation division of the state repatriation committee of Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia, Alias Nanba, has described what the committee has been doing to help refugees from Syria. The following is the text of Dmitry Basaria's interview with Alias Nanba published on the Abkhaz separatist government-run Apsnypress news website on 16 November headlined &quot;Alias Nanba: Repatriates from Syria create jobs and even become major taxpayers&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the social and adaptation division of the state repatriation committee of the republic of [Georgia's breakaway] Abkhazia, Alias Nanba, said that over the period of the existence of the state committee, about 5,000 repatriates, including more than 1,000 from Syria, have moved to Abkhazia. Alias Nanba told Apsnypress how a lot of refugees found second homes in Abkhazia in the hard times for the Syrian Arab Republic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special norm applied to repatriates from Syria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Basaria] How is the programme of repatriation of refugees from Syria to Abkhazia working?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Nanba] The thing is that the state repatriation programme is still being developed. There are only regulations that the work of the agency is based on. The committee is nevertheless working efficiently. It can be stated that over the period of the agency's activities, the size of [Abkhazia's] population has increased by 5 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is noteworthy that a special norm is applied to repatriates from Syria, as they are refugees. The state committee gives every repatriate time for adaptation - five years. This means that people are granted available financial assistance during the period and they also receive assistance in finding accommodation and jobs, obtaining citizenship of the republic of Abkhazia and pensions for elderly people, and having juniors placed at educational institutions. In addition, the state committee pays for instruction at schools and pre-school institutions and, partially, at Abkhaz State University. Repatriates often renounce financial aid themselves before the five-year term expires, as they successfully adapt to Abkhaz society. Of course, there are some, who would like to receive this aid indefinitely, but after the term expires, we provide only legal support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Basaria] How did you manage to establish ties with representatives of the Abkhaz diaspora in Syria and how difficult was the repatriation process?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Nanba] Before the civil war started in Syria, repatriates moved to Abkhazia spontaneously, as there was no representation of Abkhazia in that country. However, after the conflict started, a delegation of the committee visited Syria and established contacts with representatives of the Abkhaz ethnicity. More than 500 people moved to Abkhazia during the first years of the war by groups from 50 to 100 people. At the beginning, the committee was unable to cope with financial problems that emerged in its activities and we had to appeal to the government for help. Sharaf Marshan, representative of the committee, is now working in Syria. He led the local federation of Circassians [North Caucasus ethnic group closely related to the Abkhaz] for 18 years. He collects information on every potential repatriate to confirm their Abkhaz origin and submits it to the committee. For our part, we help people to receive Russian transit visas with assistance of the foreign ministry of the republic of Abkhazia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Basaria] It has been said that repatriates from Syria are unwilling to adapt to Abkhazia, &quot;live off the state&quot;, and when they receive immovable property, they sell it and leave this country. How reliable are these rumours?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Nanba] First, as I have already said, repatriates are not given any property to own. They are given hired accommodation and the committee pays for it. Even if they wanted, they would be unable to sell it, as they have no rights to the accommodation. Therefore, I can assure you that I have never encountered such facts. Of course, there may be cases, when people purchase immovable property with their own money and then sell it and, for some reason, leave this country. They have the same rights as other Abkhaz citizens and we cannot dictate what they should do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, as regards adaptation, I can say for sure that repatriates from Syria &quot;do not live off the state&quot;. Moreover, in some cases, they create jobs and even become major taxpayers. At the moment, we are paying for the accommodation of only 30 families of repatriates from Syria and others sustain themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans for future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Basaria] Please tell us about the state committee's priority plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Nanba] It is necessary to develop a state repatriation programme. However, this problem is largely within the limits of the competence of the law-making branch. We are now analysing the work the committee has done to identify priority directions in our activities and help to develop such a programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also necessary to build new homes to accommodate repatriates. At the moment, just six cottage-type houses are on the balance of the committee and they are insufficient to house all of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Apsnypress [note]): The state repatriation committee was set up on 23 March 1993 to create conditions for the repatriation of compatriots, whose ancestors were forced to leave Abkhazia as a result of tragic events in the 19th century [war of Caucasus peoples with the Russian Empire], and to help them in adapting to Abkhazia. A non-budgetary repatriation fund that receives 2 per cent of tax liabilities was set up in 1998 to finance the state repatriation programme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's highest court has ruled that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach Europe, dismissing a challenge from Slovakia and Hungary and deepening an east-west rift that could permanently fracture the union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary condemned yesterday's ruling as &quot;outrageous and irresponsible&quot;, an act of &quot;political rape&quot;, and vowed to resist it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Szijjarto, Hungary's foreign minister, used unprecedented language to attack the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for upholding an EU &quot;relocation&quot; policy decided at the height of Europe's migration crisis in 2015. &quot;This decision jeopardises the security and future of all of Europe,&quot; he said. &quot;Politics has raped European law and values. The real battle is only just beginning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response suggests that the issue of migrants, with which Brussels has unsuccessfully wrestled for three years, will exacerbate a cultural and political split at the heart of the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary and Poland could lose EU funding if they do not comply with EU law. EU cash is worth some 3 per cent of their GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ECJ threw out in its entirety a legal challenge from Hungary and Slovakia to binding quotas being used by Brussels to try to relocate 160,000 refugees from Greece and Italy across Europe. Slovakia has since backed away from confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU has struggled to impose the quotas, with only 27,645, or 17 per cent, of refugees so far relocated. The judges ruled that the quotas were legally justified. They &quot;respond effectively and swiftly to an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of displaced persons&quot;, in what was Europe's worst migration crisis since the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court additionally decreed that the EU, via a majority of governments, was legally right to override Hungary and Slovakia because it &quot;was not required to act unanimously when it adopted the contested decision&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary has vowed to reject the quotas that it claims have damaged national sovereignty. After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe, it claimed that the EU court was holding open the door to Muslim refugees who posed a security risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poland was quick to rally behind Hungary. Beata Szydlo, its prime minister, pledged to continue Warsaw's refusal to accept any refugees under EU quotas. &quot;This absolutely does not change the stance of the Polish government with respect to migration policy,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal action was opened in June by the European Commission against Budapest, Prague and Warsaw for failing to accept relocations. The countries have defied the quotas to redistribute 160,000 Syrian, Eritrean and Iraqi asylum seekers from Greece and Italy across Europe. Britain is exempt from the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU migration commissioner, warned the three countries yesterday that legal action, possibly resulting in huge fines, would be stepped up. &quot;By its decision the court confirms that there was indeed an emergency situation, that the measures were appropriate to help Greece and Italy. Now there is no time to waste, all member states should focus on delivering the relocation commitments,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If member states that have not relocated do not change their approach in the coming weeks we will then con-tinue the last step to refer Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic to the ECJ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas de Maizi&Egrave;re, the German interior minister, told the rebel nations that they would be in breach of EU membership obligations unless they surrendered. &quot;I now expect the countries concerned to fulfil their obligations to accept their allotted number of refugees,&quot; he said. &quot;If that does not happen, then a treaty violation procedure can be used.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU has been encouraged by Slovakia having dropped vocal opposition to the quotas. &quot;We fully respect the verdict of the European Court of Justice,&quot; Robert Fico, the Slovakian prime minister, said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission is hoping that a drop in the number of migrants eligible for the quotas will take the pressure off and allow a compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well migrant quotas, Poland is embroiled in legal fights with the EU over democratic standards, environmental legislation and rule of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NINA GRUNFELD</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 14</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince William recently visited the Imperial War Museum to discuss the launch of the next phase of its privately funded Second World War and Holocaust galleries. Maybe this news didn't reach the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation, which yesterday announced the winner of a competition to build its own education centre and memorial just half a mile away from the museum in Victoria Tower Gardens by the Houses of Parliament - and funded to a cost of &pound;50 million by the unsuspecting taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you suggest a new Holocaust memorial and learning centre ought not to be built, you don't feel very popular. And when the likes of Natasha Kaplinsky, Alex Salmond and the Chief Rabbi are the powers behind the project, you don't feel you have a chance to stop it. But this story is not as black-and-white as it might appear and, as the daughter of German Jewish refugees, I don't believe the memorial or the learning centre belong in their proposed location.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course a Holocaust memorial is an admirable idea, but the decision to build it in a park so close to the Imperial War Museum is ludicrous. The museum already has an unbelievably moving Holocaust exhibition and has its own plans for a stunning new exhibition centre. It bid to be the location of the memorial, and its Foster and Partnersdesigned plans, including a wall of remembrance inscribed with the names of Holocaust victims, were reminiscent of Rachel Whiteread's Holocaust Memorial in Vienna. The museum has artefacts and content. This new scheme has nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poorly conceived project was decided upon a couple of years ago by David Cameron when, one can only presume, he wanted to emphasise his party's diversity. There is no public record of the research that decided on Victoria Tower Gardens as the perfect site, no record of the decision-making process at all. All we know is that Peter Bazalgette was handed &pound;50 million and they decided to build over and under a park next to Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relevance of the proximity to Parliament is apparently that the Holocaust and treatment of refugees is a subject close to the hearts of British politicians. But how true is that? Think for a moment about the British relationship with the Holocaust. Britain took in refugees to shelter them from Nazi atrocities. But not only were the British very late to open their doors to Jewish refugees, they were also quick to close them - my uncle and aunt were too late and ended up in Colombia. Plus, after the war, I had to live through an era (is it really over?) when my school had a Jewish quota, as did many of the clubs I might normally have belonged to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other problems, too. Living almost next to Parliament, as I do, you are not only part of a community as local and friendly as any around the world but you are far more aware than most of pollution, traffic accidents, guns, terrorism and road blocks. So close to Parliament and Westminster Abbey, this is not a part of London that needs another potential target. And will we not mourn the unnecessary removal of a much-loved park? The park has many memorials in it already: one commemorating the abolition of slavery, another the Suffragettes, and yet another a stunning statue by Rodin of the Burghers of Calais. All illustrate the good that can come out of www.evil.No positives came out of the Holocaust - there is still hatred in the world and genocide is still going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This duplicate project will cost &pound;50 million that could have been put towards a good cause: rescuing a few more refugees or, if we want to stick to the Holocaust theme, commemorating British people who took in refugee Jews. The amazing Stolpersteine - brass cubes inscribed with the names and lives of victims of Nazi persecution - that we see on streets all over Europe could be used to thank Britons for taking in Jews like my parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For obvious reasons, I am aware of anti-Semitism and the effects of prejudice. But I am not convinced that a memorial and learning centre right next to Parliament is going to give Jews a good name. On the contrary, it links Jews with the destruction of a precious park, and with taking &pound;50 million for a project that could have been used to help others instead. The Imperial War Museum is already building a home for memories of Jewish suffering. Don't diffuse that focus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An independent film director who has travelled around the world documenting the refugee crisis is learning essential skills at the Google Digital Garage in Sheffield to help raise further awareness of the cause.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheffield-based Lucas Jedrzejak is well-known within the independent film industry. For the last 12 years, he has worked on projects covering a vast array of topics, from directing early music videos for the likes of Def Leppard to getting unprecedented access to boxer Ricky Hatton at the height of his fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His most recent project has seen him travelling to over 30 countries, covering the refugee crisis and putting together a documentary where he is helping bring music and education to refugee children without access to schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet despite being an award-winning director with work regularly showcased on the film festival circuit, Polish-born Mr Jedrzejak still struggles to raise awareness of the projects to people outside the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a friend told him about the new Google Digital Garage opening in the centre of the city, he was keen to go along and find out how he could set up a new website and take control of the content he produces and actively promotes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attended a course on how to build a website and grow his presence online and intends to launch this to help promote the new documentary, Ketermaya, which tells the story of a group of Syrian children living in a refugee camp in Lebanon - and details how Lucas raised money to buy them a piano from Beirut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;In today's day and age, getting a film funded and distributed is extremely difficult, not just because commissioning editors are notoriously particular but because the market is becoming increasingly competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To get noticed, filmmakers usually start with a festival circuit where the most prestigious festivals pick a handful of films and the other 80 per cent get rejected. A festival tour normally takes at least two years of promoting your film around the world, which is time-consuming and costs a lot of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only other option is to create a huge online presence that is backed up by social media. To do this efficiently you have to understand SEO [search engine optimisation] and analytics and it's easy to get lost. For those reasons the Google Digital Garage in Sheffield is a wonderful place to start boosting your skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google's Digital Garage initiative is part of a multi-million pound investment offering everyone in the UK five free hours of digital training and is part of the Government's digital strategy, which aims to boost digital skills training in the UK by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May King Tsang, trainer at Digital Garage Sheffield, said: &quot;Whether you're a successful film director like Lucas, who is trying to get his work noticed by bigger audiences, or simply someone looking to find help in setting up an email address, the Digital Garage can help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've helped those who have never switched a computer on to others looking to learn the basics in coding. It doesn't matter your age, background or job, everyone should be able to make the most of the internet and we're thrilled Lucas is learning how to get such important issues even more visible online.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations migration agency and its partners are supporting Bangladesh in coordinating assistance for the influx of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees, including with clean water and sanitation, shelter, food and psychosocial care for the most vulnerable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world has rarely witnessed a refugee crisis of such speed, with more than half a million crossing into Bangladesh in just over a month,&quot; said William Lacy Swing, Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), on Wednesday, as he completed a three-day visit to Bangladesh.<BR><BR>&quot;The arc of misery that exists between Northern Rakhine state and Cox's Bazar is deeply upsetting - too many people suffering desperately with too little support,&quot; he said, adding that just two days ago, some 1,500 more Rohingya refugees waded through a river as monsoon rains drenched the country.<BR><BR>The Bangladesh Government has confirmed that it will move an estimated 15,000 people currently stranded in a so-called &quot;no man's land&quot; near the Anjuman Para border crossing point in Cox's Bazar's Ukhia District, into more appropriate settlement areas.<BR><BR>Director General Swing began his visit with a day-long tour of the makeshift settlements in Ukhia and Teknaf sub-districts, where an estimated 800,000 refugees are now living, to observe the scale of the crisis and the sheer enormity of needs.<BR><BR>&quot;I saw women carrying small babies, only a few days old, sometimes born while their young mothers were fleeing deadly violence in torrential rains. I saw young children, who had lost not just their parents, but any remnants of hope,&quot; Mr. Swing stated.<BR><BR>He called for global commitment to these women and children, who are among the most vulnerable in the world, to do everything possible to ensure that their suffering stops here. &quot;If adequate resources are not mobilized by the international community, we cannot make that commitment. Thousands will suffer without food, shelter, health care and protection,&quot; he emphasized. We must make a commitment to these women and children, who are among the most vulnerable in the world, that we will do everything in our ability to ensure that their suffering stops here.<BR><BR>Based on the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State established by Myanmar's Office of the State Counsellor and the Kofi Annan Foundation, the Director General highlighted the critical importance of a peaceful resolution to the crisis.<BR><BR>&quot;Humanitarian aid alone is not a solution. The root causes of this crisis are in Myanmar and there can be no lasting peace in Rakhine without inclusive development,&quot; he said, pointing to the recommendations as a roadmap to peaceful co-existence and welcoming the Myanmar Government's commitment to implementing the Commission's findings.<BR><BR>&quot;The first step in that implementation process will be to urgently allow UN agencies to resume their work in Rakhine state,&quot; Mr. Swing said.<BR><BR>Since late August, IOM has scaled up quickly, providing: shelter to 379,000 people; health consultations to 47,000 individuals; over 11,000 dignity kits; 678,000 litres of water; and 200 staff to assist the Health Ministry in vaccinating 679,000 people against cholera. IOM staffing has also been boosted with 443 staff and in-country volunteers.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian groups have warned of a looming emergency on Greece's eastern Aegean islands, the day after residents converged on Athens in protest at policies that have led to thousands of migrants and refugees being marooned in reception centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A surge in arrivals from neighbouring Turkey has seen numbers soar with officials speaking of a four-fold increase in men, women and children seeking asylum on Chios, Kos, Leros, Lesbos and Samos. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions are deteriorating in the vastly overcrowded camps in a situation that M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) on Wednesday warned was &quot;beyond desperate&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Anger rises in Lesbos over crowded refugee camps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Lesbos, entire families who recently arrived from countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq are packed into small summer tents, under the rain and in low temperatures struggling to keep dry and warm,&quot; said Aria Danika, MSF's project coordinator on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our mental health clinic we have received an average of 10 patients with acute mental distress every day, including many who tried to kill themselves or self-harm. The situation on the island was already terrible. Now it's beyond desperate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators - led by delegations of officials from Chios, Lesbos and Samos - gathered in the Athens sunshine on Tuesday to demand that the government move people out of camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Action has to be taken now, before it is too late,&quot; said Panos Pitsios, president of the town council of Mytilene, Lesbos's capital. &quot;We are heading towards an eruption, a situation that is on the verge of getting out of control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The island, the gateway for an estimated 800,000 refugees and migrants who entered Europe at the height of the refugee crisis two years ago, is now housing more than 7,000 people in facilities with a capacity of 2,300. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy of stranding migrants and refugees in remote camps where tensions have also mounted between rival ethnicities has also been condemned by human rights groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisations increasingly fear that unless asylum seekers are transferred to the mainland where facilities are less crowded and better equipped, thousands could be left out in the cold as winter approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of last week, reception centres on the isles were almost 7,200 over capacity, condemning inmates to live in appalling conditions with lack of access to clean water, sanitation facilities and health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The Greek island camp where only the sick or pregnant can leave</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayors from all five islands said in a proclamation handed to the migration minister, Ioannis Mouzalas, that Athens' containment policies had turned their communities into &quot;island prisons&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has to be immediate decongestion of the islands,&quot; Chios's mayor, Manolis Vournous, told the Guardian. &quot;There simply isn't the infrastructure to cope.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2,500 people, he said, were currently stuck in Vial, the island's main camp, purpose-built to hold no more than 800. &quot;It is an intolerable situation that is putting human lives at risk and endangering social cohesion. It has to end.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leftist-led Greek government argues it is hamstrung by a landmark accord reached between the EU and Turkey to stem the flows last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement, asylum seekers arriving on Greek islands must remain in situ until their requests are approved - a process made longer by a notoriously slow-moving justice system that has been impacted by the country's long-running economic crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enforced wait is exacerbated by the spectre that, if rejected, asylum seekers will be forcibly returned to Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Thousands of unaccompanied children in Greek island camps need help | Alfonso Montero</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks, prime minister Alexis Tsipras's administration has taken steps to alleviate the situation - transferring hundreds of migrants by ship to Athens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mouzalas recently announced that the government was also considering renting hotels and dispatching cruise ships to the islands to house the growing numbers over the winter months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with more than 15,000 people officially registered in state-run camps on the isles, the measures were described as &quot;hopelessly inadequate&quot; by locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than a third of Mytilene's total population are migrants and refugees,&quot; said Pitsios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Residents are afraid at night to even leave their homes and now they are at the end of their tether.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ship arrived at the port of Piraeus on Saturday, carrying some 180 men, women and children.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The migrants, who made the perilous crossing from Turkey within the last few months, will now be distributed to several hosting centres across Greece 's southern Attica region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos show families - including small children and babies - disembarking from the Blue Star 2' passenger ship at Piraeus Port before being transferred onto buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Located near the coast of Turkey, the island of Samos has become a popular destination for refugees escaping war-town Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 60,000 refugees and migrants remain stranded in Greece following European border closures and restrictions last year. The daily number of arrivals to Greek islands has again risen in recent weeks.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR), 5,000 migrants arrived on Greek islands in September, an increase of 35 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to AFP calculations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is putting extra pressure on already overcrowded sites at a time when aid agencies are reducing their engagement on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The September figure compares to a total of 13,320 arrivals from January to 20 August, according to the International Organization for Migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resurgence of migrants making the journey to Europe comes despite the EU deal with Turkey in March 2016, which drastically reduced the number of arrivals, and amid political tensions between Ankara and Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news comes a day after a Syrian refugee was arrested in northern Greece on terrorism-related charges following a review of his asylum application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities said the 32-year-old man was detained Thursday in the northeast city of Alexandroupolis as a suspected fighter of the Islamic State group while in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, who hasn't been named, traveled to a Greek island from Turkey last year and lives in the northern city of Thessaloniki with his wife and two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied the charges and shouted 'they are liars' to reporters, before appearing at a public prosecutor's office Friday. He was given until Monday to prepare his defense, but remained in custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his home, the suspect's wife spoke to The Associated Press but asked not to be named because her husband hadn't been formally identified. She didn't comment on the charges, but said: 'Daesh is in Syria. Now we are in Greece,' using the Arabic term for IS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police investigators told the AP that they are examining the suspect's mobile phone and other seized devices to determine whether he was in contact with IS fighters after moving to Greece.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said he had traveled to Greece from neighboring Turkey in June last year, reaching the Greek island of Leros, before moving to the mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European governments fear that Islamic State extremists could hide among the streams of refugees fleeing violence in Syria and Iraq. Many of the fighters in the deadly November 2015 attacks in Paris slipped into Europe on that route with false passports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been a handful of arrests of asylum-seekers linked to IS, including in Germany and Austria, but officials believe the numbers are small. Concern over the threat, however, has contributed to a rightward swing among many European electorates.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police cleared the remaining asylum-seekers from a shuttered Australian-run detention complex on Manus Island yesterday, ending a three-week protest which started with some 600 eating smuggled food and drinking rain water to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia closed the detention centre on 31 October after it was declared illegal by a Papua New Guinea court, but the asylum seekers refused to leave to transit centres saying they feared for their safety. Despite the unsanitary conditions and lack of adequate food and fresh water, about 300 remained when Papua New Guinea police started removing people yesterday. &quot;The refugees are leaving the prison camp,&quot; Kurdish journalist Behrouz Boochani said. &quot;We did our best to send out our voice but the government does not care.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said in a statement yesterday that all of the asylum seekers had now departed for alternative accommodation. &quot;Advocates should now desist from holding out false hope to these men that they will ever be brought to Australia,&quot; Mr Dutton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Geneva, the UN refugee agency UNHCR denounced the use of force by Papua New Guinean police to remove the refugees and asylum seekers and called for Australia to ensure their protection. &quot;The beating of refugees and asylum-seekers by uniformed officers with metal poles, shown by footage released today, is both shocking and inexcusable,&quot; UNHCR said in a statement.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tiger escaped from a circus in Paris yesterday and roamed the streets of the French capital for &quot;some time&quot; before being killed, police said. The big cat was &quot;neutralised&quot; by a staff member from the circus near a bridge over the River Seine, about two kilometres (1.2 miles) from the Eiffel Tower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Paris police official confirmed that the tiger had been loose for &quot;some time&quot; yesterday but said there had been no reported injuries or casualties.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Church of Sweden has urged its clergy to use gender-neutral language when referring to the supreme deity, refraining from using terms like &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;He&quot; in favour of the less specific &quot;God&quot;. The move is one of several taken by the national Evangelical Lutheran church in updating a 31-year-old handbook setting out how services should be conducted in terms of language, liturgy, hymns and other aspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was taken at the end of an eight-day meeting of the church's 251-member decision-making body, and takes effect from 20 May on the Christian holiday of Pentecost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former state church, headquartered in Uppsala, some 37 miles north of the capital, the church has 6.1 million baptised members in a country of 10 million. It is headed by a woman, Archbishop Antje Jackelen. Ms Jackelen told Sweden's TT news agency a more inclusive language had already been discussed at the 1986 conference. &quot;Theologically, for instance, we know that God is beyond our gender determinations, God is not human,&quot; Ms Jackelen was quoted as saying by TT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change was met with criticism, however. Christer Pahlmblad, an associate theology professor with Sweden's Lund University, told Denmark's Kristeligt Dagblad that the move was &quot;undermining the doctrine of the Trinity and the community with the other Christian churches&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China nursery abuse claims prompt police investigation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese police are investigating claims of sexual molestation and needlemarks on children at a Beijing kindergarten run by RYB Education Inc, the latest case in a booming childcare industry to spark outrage among parents, sending the company's New York-listed shares tumbling yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official Xinhua news agency said that police were checking allegations that some teachers and staff at the kindergarten had abused children, who were &quot;reportedly sexually molested, pierced by needles and given unidentified pills&quot;. Parents said their children, some as young as three, relayed troubling accounts of a naked adult male conducting purported &quot;medical check-ups&quot; on students, who were also unclothed, other media said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The welfare of children in professional care has become a hot-button issue in China, where a string of high-profile cases of abuse has underlined lax regulations and supervision in the childcare and early learning industry. China's education ministry has begun a special investigation into the operation of kindergartens and told education departments nationwide to &quot;take warning from these types of incidents&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks after the bodies of 45 men, women and children were unearthed in mass graves in Myanmar, the mystery over who carried out the massacre in a Hindu village has deepened. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar government forces reported finding the skeletal remains in three large graves - a further 48 missing villagers are also presumed dead - and flew out journalists to the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials claimed Muslim Rohingya militants were responsible for the massacre, but the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army denied killing the villagers. The insurgent group, which is waging war in Myanmar's Rakhine state, said it does not target civilians. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Who are the Rohingya and what is happening in Myanmar?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya refugees have accused the Myanmar government of playing &quot;dirty tricks&quot; over the killings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of Hindu women who crossed into neighbouring Bangladesh from Myanmar after surviving the attack claimed the Myanmar military carried out the massacre. However, when they were subsequently returned to Myanmar by security forces, they offered a different version of events, blaming Rohingya militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this backdrop of claim and counter-claim, UN human rights official Jyoti Sanghera has called on Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to &quot;stop the violence&quot;. Sanghera said she feared the stateless Rohingya refugees would be interned if they returned to Myanmar from Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence broke out in Rakhine state on 25 August, when Rohingya insurgents attacked 30 police posts and an army camp, killing about a dozen people. The Myanmar government has since been accused of ethnic cleansing, 519,000 Muslims fleeing the country as security forces have torched homes, crops and villages and laid landmines along the border to prevent people from returning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights - who has described the Myanmar government operations as &quot;a textbook example of ethnic cleansing&quot; - said in a statement on Wednesday that the actions appeared to be &quot;a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'It only takes one terrorist': the Buddhist monk who reviles Myanmar's Muslims | Marella Oppenheim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Credible information indicates that the Myanmar security forces purposely destroyed the property of the Rohingyas, scorched their dwellings and entire villages in northern Rakhine State, not only to drive the population out in droves but also to prevent the fleeing Rohingya victims from returning to their homes,&quot; the UN human rights office said in a report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While international condemnation of the crisis is growing, the military campaign has found popular support in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, or for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government cited the massacre of the villagers as evidence of violence on both sides. But survivors, who initially told reporters in Myanmar that Rohingya attackers were responsible, and were graphically quoted in the country's newspapers, later told journalists, aid workers and Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh that their loved ones were killed by security forces and armed men from the Mogh, local Rakhine Buddhists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the survivors returned to Myanmar, their story changed for a second time, with some claiming the attackers were masked and they did not know who was responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shib Kumar, a Hindu refugee, said the killers of her parents and aunt were masked and dressed in black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could not recognise those men who killed Hindus as well as Muslims. We the Hindus and Muslims fled together,&quot; said Kumar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdus Salam, another Rohingya refugee, said the Hindus knew who the killers were. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why they decided not to move inland towards the Buddhist-majority areas and felt safer to take the company of the Muslim neighbours to flee to Bangladesh,&quot; said Salam. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya refugee Shofi Ullah accused the Myanmar military of &quot;playing a game&quot; with the Hindu bodies to create more pressure on the Rohingya community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ullah said: &quot;Some weeks ago, the Myanmar authorities presented photos of some people setting fire to Rohingya-owned homes and claimed that they were Rohingya. But the international media proved with evidence that the people in the photos were actually Hindu. Now they are using some Hindu women to cover up the misdeeds of the security forces and the Buddhist militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are sure that the Myanmar government's dirty trick will get exposed soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The British public has to date raised &pound;9m for the emergency appeal for people fleeing Myanmar. The UK government has announced it will match the next &pound;2m of public donations, in addition to the &pound;3m already announced by the Department for International Development.                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The extra cash for the  Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) appeal was announced by the UK development secretary, Priti Patel, on Thursday. &quot;The situation facing those fleeing Myanmar is truly desperate,&quot; she said. &quot;We are hearing stories of small children separated from their families and of mothers giving birth in appalling conditions. DEC member charities are on the ground right now but they urgently need more funds to reach as many people as possible.&quot;                   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince Harry has met the family of a Danish soldier whose body was flown back with him from Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prince visited the Danish Veterans Centre in Copenhagen with Prince Joachim of Denmark on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there he had a private meeting with the parents of 21-year-old Morten Krogh Jensen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry, 33, has previously told of returning from his deployment to Afghanistan with the soldier's coffin, as well as three critically injured British soldiers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his opening speech at the Invictus Games earlier this year he said the flight changed the direction of his life and led him to create Invictus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking after the meeting on Thursday, Prince Joachim said: ``This (the soldier's death) was an eye opener for Prince Harry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This was a motivating factor for him, to start pushing, to establish the Invictus Games. This is the culmination of that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: ``You've got to look at it (the soldier's death) from a very high perspective and say 'well, it was not in vain after all'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This has benefited thousands over the last nine years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While at the centre Harry, who has been in the Danish capital on a two-day trip, watched a game of rolling football, which sees veterans lie on skateboard style boards, and met members of the Danish Invictus Games team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was reunited with Maurice Manuel, 41, a Danish veteran who has taken part in all three of the Invictus Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry was pictured kissing Mr Manuel on the head after he won a gold medal at the games in Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Harry met the veteran again, he joked: ``My lips have never recovered.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day Harry had warned of the dangers of social media for young people when he met ambassadors for mental health campaign One of Us at a Danish bakery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: ``People are spending far too much time online and it's like a mental running machine that they can't get off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``You wouldn't put your body through such a workout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I'm the last person to say ban it but people are suffering from mental fatigue and getting burnt out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his final visit of the trip, Harry met students at the Orestad Gymnasium school and told them he hoped to visit a refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicolai Moltke-Leth, 47, founder of True North school, who was leading a discussion about refugees with students, asked Harry if he had ever visited a camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry said: ``I want to, very soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It just depends on when I have time to do it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to another group of students Harry apologised for the older generation but said he was hopeful for the younger generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: ``I say your generation because I'm 33, despite the fact I'm still trying to clutch on to youth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: ``Your generation gives every single person hope, I promise you that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prince arrived in the Danish capital on Wednesday morning after flying in by private plane and started the trip by meeting Queen Margrethe II of Denmark at the Palace of Amalienborg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His trip to Denmark is the latest in a series of European trips made by the royal family this year, following last year's Brexit vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a reception at the city's Tivoli Gardens on Wednesday evening, he spoke of the ``strong ties'' between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: ``Our two countries have an unbreakable bond which is as strong now as it ever has been.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Kensington Palace said there were ``no current plans'' for Harry to visit a refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015 the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall toured a camp in Jordan, near the Syrian border, and described the plight of the refugees as ``heartbreaking''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry's girlfriend, actress Meghan Markle, is global ambassador for World Vision Canada, a charity which helps refugees and disaster survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past she has commented on how she combines her glamorous lifestyle with humanitarian commitments, saying: ``While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, coexist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``And for me, they must.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THEY devoted their lives to fostering nearly 300 needy children including refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last night Penny and Ronald Jones were devastated after it appeared they had unwittingly given their love and support to two teenagers embroiled in the investigation into the Parsons Green bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Jones, 71, and Mr Jones, 88, have been fostering since the 1970s, welcoming 268 children into their home, and were honoured with MBEs from the Queen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yesterday it was claimed they had been caring for the main suspect in Friday's attack, an 18-year-old refugee, believed to be Iraqi, who was arrested in Dover on Saturday, apparently trying to flee the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbours in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, said the teenager had been a 'problem' and that they had been contacting officials saying they were unable to cope. It is also thought the couple had in the past looked after Yahya Faroukh, 21, whose home near Heathrow airport was searched by police yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As police searched the couple's suburban home at the weekend, a friend told the Mail: 'To say they are gutted is an understatement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For this to happen, after all the kids they have fostered, and for it to ruin everything... questions have to be asked about what checks were made and who decided to place him with them.' Even though Mr Jones is on the cusp of his tenth decade and uses a mobility scooter, the couple were coaxed out of retirement a few years ago by a deep-seated desire to help children fleeing war zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Jones said in a recent interview: 'We try and support where we can - because they've had bad lives. They just need to be loved.' When the couple were awarded their MBEs at Buckingham Palace in 2009, Mrs Jones said: 'We open our hearts to all the children. Anybody that comes to us, we will do whatever we can to help them with whatever they need.' But their latest charge, a teenager born in Baghdad who came to Britain as a refugee a couple of years ago via an immigration centre in Dover, was proving a handful, it was said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Griffiths, 28, who lives across the road, said: 'Police have been at this address a few times in the last couple of weeks.' Aaron Nye, a former foster child of the couple, said they had told him they had hosted some 'difficult teenagers' recently, adding: 'I really feel for the Penny and Ron. It's dreadful for them and it has made me quite emotional - they never asked for any of this and they have been so good to so many kids.' Family friend Jim Adaway, 37, said the couple willingly took on refugee children after retirement, but admitted they had struggled with one of the youngsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: 'I think Penny was getting in touch with [the authorities] saying, &quot;I cannot handle this one&quot;. I don't know if it was the right decision to do this.' The couple, who have six grownup children of their own, had given up fostering and were enjoying their retirement but in recent years were moved by the plight of children arriving from war zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have opened the door of their modest home to youngsters from countries including Iraq, Eritrea, Syria, Albania and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Jones said: 'You have to have patience and remember they've been through a lot - they're doing their best but nothing is going to happen overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But it's so rewarding. They're grateful to be safe, to have a bed to sleep in and to have food and [our support]... that's all they need.' One refugee was a 15-year-old boy who had smuggled himself into the country from Calais in the back of a lorry. Fostering refugees has involved accompanying them to Home Office appointments and helping them find a solicitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Jones said: 'Sometimes, watching the news, they can get so worked up that they have to leave the house and go for a walk - it's awful to see and it's so difficult for them. We just try and support where we can.' She added: 'They're all children - they just need to be loved.' Nicky Rider, 43, a neighbour of the Joneses, said: 'They are a lovely couple. I have known them all my life. They must be devastated.' Another neighbour said: 'I feel for them both. They don't deserve this at this time of their life.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We do whatever we can to help'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRUSSELS has unveiled plans to bring 50,000 refugees directly from Africa to help sideline traffickers fuelling the migration crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eurocrats said opening legal avenues' would provide them with real alternatives to perilous irregular journeys'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the &pound;439million scheme, proposed yesterday, tens of thousands would be accepted from countries including Niger, Sudan, Chad, Ethiopia and Egypt over the next two years. EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said it was about managing one of the most complex, structural phenomena of our times, not a temporary emergency'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as providing protection to refugees, such legal routes could eventually help the EU's ageing population by providing workers from abroad, officials also claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Commission scheme was unveiled alongside measures allowing member states to scrap open border rules for up to three years to deal with threats posed by terrorism. It prompted a Commissioner to warn that further measures to weaken the Schengen border system could be the beginning of the end for Europe'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The safe passage' scheme is the latest attempt to deal with the migrant crisis. Under an existing plan around 23,000 refugees - mainly those fleeing war in Syria - have been moved to EU countries. Former Prime Minister David Cameron signed up to the measure. A deal brokered with Turkey in 2016 to resettle refugees in Europe has been credited with largely shutting down the route into Europe via Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Brussels yesterday said it wanted an increased focus' on Africa to curb crossings using the deadly Mediterranean route from Libya to Italy. Critics however have pointed out that such measures could prove futile in the largely lawless North African state where it is claimed a million migrants are hoping to reach Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the plans, EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said: We need to open real alternatives to taking perilous irregular journeys.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: Europe is an ageing continent and we will need skills from abroad. It's time for the EU to be smarter, selective and productive when it comes to legal migration.' The proposal is likely to draw concerns from eastern member states who have refused to engage in EU plans to address migration flows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU separately announced plans to allow counties to bolster controls in the passport-free Schengen area. Existing rules, introduced in response to the migration crisis, allow border controls to be introduced for six months then prolonged for two years if there is a border threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules increase the initial restriction window to a year. However, countries including France and Germany have called for a two-year period to deal with possible terror threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Avramopoulos warned that temporary border controls must remain an exceptional measure of last resort'. If all these rumours that Schengen is at stake are justified and Schengen dies, I'm afraid it will be the beginning of the end of Europe,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Muslim women in Austria face a &pound;130 fine from Sunday if they wear the burka in public. Those who refuse to take off the veil on arrival at airports will also be denied entry to the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     ANGELA Merkel has &quot;guaranteed&quot; in a TV debate facing critical voters that she will not cap the number of new refugees that Germany would welcome.                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In last night's TV programme called &quot;Voting Arena&quot; on Germany's public broadcaster ARD, Merkel forcefully defended some of her prior stances and policies in front of a critical crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably she pledged not to impose an upper limit on the number of refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel said: &quot;I do not want it. I also do not believe it is practical. Guaranteed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, Ms Merkel said that Islam was not the source of terror and that Germany must take more refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     GETTY                   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the voters in the public showed themselves as more engaged and aggressive questioners than the two moderators of the TV show which pitted the German Chancellor against the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One young nurse attacked Merkel, saying that she &quot;did not do much during her mandate&quot; about the situation in German hospitals and elderly care homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man demanded to know from Merkel why there is no quota for a minimum number of employees on duty in care facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel answered that a &quot;reorientation&quot; of staffing conditions and guaranteed minimum levels of care is currently being negotiated with insurance funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     REX                   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel said: &quot;I cannot promise you that in the end everything is going to be to the best satisfaction, but there will be more of a standard. I hope it will be better in two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the young nurse did not give up in his confrontation with Merkel as he said that &quot;100,000 nurses are lacking in Germany&quot; and added that &quot;they don't just fall from the sky&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chancellor Merkel answered that she wants to overcome the deficit of skilled healthcare workers by improving working conditions and salaries and if needed to hire nurses from other EU countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     EPA                   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel added on a more personal note: &quot;And to be honest, when I can say something more. Also when you are a bit angry, it is however good, that you are also saying so. I find it awesome that you learned this profession as a young man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German Chancellor's &quot;guarantee&quot; not to impose an upper limit will not play well with the conservative Christian Social Union , the Bavarian sister party of Angela Merkel's Christian-Democratic Union .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSU advocates to cap the amount of refugees in Germany to 200,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Migrant crisis </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the point is lacking from the joint CDU-CSU election programme due to the strong disapproval of the CDU, the CSU campaigns on the issue in Bavaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germans will go the polls on September 24, with Angela Merkel seeking a fourth successive term as Chancellor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Merkel's current coalition partner - the social-democratic SPD - is lagging behind in the polls as former President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz did not manage to win over voters despite an early boost when he announced his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal FDP under Christian Lindner is slightly up in the polls, with some German political pundits predicting that the party could replace the SPD as Merkel's junior coalition partner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Pakistani newspaper The Nation website on 7 September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islamabad has urged the world to put pressure on Myanmar, where renewed violence hasforced out tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif says the Rohingyas' plight is &quot;a challenge to the conscience&quot; of the world and that Pakistan was committed to providing humanitarian aid to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry issued a statement containing Asif's opening remarks at a conference of Pakistani diplomats on Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political parties and clerics have organized rallies across Pakistan to express their solidarity with Rohingyas and to condemn Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi for the reported massacres of Rohingya Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Myanmar has counted 400 deaths and says most were terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest violence began on Aug 25 after insurgent attacks on police. The government forces retaliated with what they called &quot;clearance operations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations says some 146,000 people have fled Myanmar into Bangladesh since August 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Wednesday that the World Food Programme is appealing for $11.3 million to support the influx of people and those already living in camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN agency has provided food to tens of thousands of people, with Dujarric describing women and children arriving there as &quot;hungry and malnourished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dujarric also said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres &quot;is continuing his diplomatic contacts regarding the situation in Myanmar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Myanmar government's top security adviser claims an insurgent group that attacked 30 police posts two weeks ago is trying to carve out a separate Muslim state from the Buddhist-majority nation, and the armed forces are using maximum restraint in their operations against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar's National Security Adviser Thaung Tun said at a news conference on Wednesday in the capital, Naypyitaw, that security forces are making every effort to avoid harming innocent civilians. He was responding to accusations that the army and police fired indiscriminately on civilians and razed Muslim Rohingya villages after the attacks on the police posts in Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norway's foreign minister called on Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her government to allow humanitarian groups to distribute aid in violence-wracked Rakhine state, deeming limits on their work &quot;extremely serious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende said on Wednesday that the Norwegian government is deeply concerned about escalating violence and the deteriorating humanitarian situation of the Rohingya. He said &quot;all groups must show restraint,&quot; but stressed that &quot;authorities, under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi, have a particular responsibility to protect civilians from abuses, to stop the violence and to ensure humanitarian access.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to officials, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's wife is heading to Bangladesh to oversee the distribution of aid to Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and to highlight the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erdogan's office said on Wednesday that Emine Erdogan will be accompanied by her son, Bilal Erdogan, the family and social affairs minister, and senior Turkish aid officials during her visit to Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu is also scheduled to depart for Bangladesh and is expected to visit a refugee camp and oversee the delivery of aid. He said on Wednesday that Turkey wants a lasting solution to the plight of the Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says his country wants a lasting solution for the plight of Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar. Cavusoglu spoke on Wednesday in Baku, Azerbaijan, before travelling to Bangladesh where he's expected to visit a refugee camp for Rohingya and oversee the delivery of humanitarian aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says Turkey will also deliver ambulances to Bangladesh to help it cope with the refugee flows, Cavusoglu said. Cavusoglu said Turkey was determined not to &quot;abandon&quot; Rohingya and said his visit would help determine steps that can be taken to improve their conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says: &quot;God willing, together with the international community, a lasting solution can be found.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bangladeshi disaster management official says the country will set up a new camp to accommodate Rohingya Muslims who have arrived from Myanmar since August 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Shah Kamal of the Ministry of Disaster Management did not say when the new camp would be ready. He said on Wednesday that the camp would be established in Tyingkhali, south of Cox's Bazar district and near the established camp in Balukhali where more than 50,000 Rohingya have been sheltering since October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked officials to prepare a database with fingerprints for the new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cox's Bazar official Ali Hossain said the plans were still under discussion, and the government was coordinating with international agencies to handle the &quot;very complicated&quot; situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said officials were visiting the area and, &quot;if necessary, we will take 400 acres or more land for the new establishment. The Bangladesh government will take responsibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Government has been accused of wilfully trapping thousands of refugees at risk of rape, torture and imprisonment in Libya by increasing efforts to stop them fleeing across the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a visit to Tripoli, Boris Johnson vowed that the UK would support the fragile Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) to &quot;reduce the number of illegal migrants heading for Europe&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Libya is the front line for many challenges which, left unchecked, can pose problems for us in the UK - particularly illegal migration and the threat from terrorism,&quot; the Foreign Secretary said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New militia may be the reason migrants can't leave Libya for Italy</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU helping force refugees back to 'hell on Earth' to stop boats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why it is so important that we work with the Libyan government and our partners to help bring stability to Libya, stopping it from becoming a fertile ground for terrorists, gun runners and people traffickers in close proximity to Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Johnson said that as well as supporting an unspecified &quot;political process&quot;, the UK was backing &quot;practical efforts ... to ensure the Libyan coastguard can secure their own borders, reducing the number of illegal migrants heading for Europe&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement incensed humanitarian groups running search and rescue missions in the central Mediterranean, where more than 2,400 men, women and children have drowned while attempting to reach Europe so far this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs are bearing the brunt of increased aggression displayed by the Libyan coastguard, seeing armed officers block rescues, board migrant dinghies and open fire while attempting to seize control of the search and rescue zone in international waters from the Italian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boris Johnson meets members of the Libyan coastguardat a naval base in Tripoli (PA)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coastguard, which is being trained by the Royal Navy and EU partners, stands accused of killing, shooting and abusing migrants and attacking aid workers but has benefited from substantial funds and equipment from Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing for their safety, several groups have withdrawn their ships as political and public support from Europe wanes and unproven allegations of &quot;collusion&quot; with Libyan people smugglers gain traction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), which had one of its ships fired on by the Libyan coastguard in an incident verified by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year, accused the British Government of attempting to shirk responsibility for the refugee crisis and instability in Libya - whatever the cost.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister admits UK 'could have done more' to prevent chaos in Libya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre Heller-Perache, the charity's UK head of programmes, said: &quot;What Boris Johnson notably fails to mention is the multiple occasions - as recent as last week - on which the UK-trained Libyan coastguard has threatened, or even fired upon, NGO search and rescue vessels operating in international waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shows that the British Government is happy to sweep the appalling human cost of its deterrence policies on migration under the carpet - anything to make this someone else's problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Heller-Perache said MSF staff had met migrants in squalid Libyan detention centres who were taken there by the coastguard, accusing the UK of &quot;helping to trap thousands of people in appalling conditions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its policy is pushing refugees and migrants into the hands of criminals and people traffickers, contributing to the very problem the Government claims to want to solve,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damage from bullets fired by the Libyan coastguard below the bridge on MSF ship the Bourbon Argos (Lizzie Dearden )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Foreign Secretary can no longer remain silent on this issue - he has serious questions to answer on the harm caused by Britain's support for the Libyan coastguard, and the role that it plays trapping people in Libya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued by the Foreign Office (FCO) made no direct mention of the rival Libyan government based in Tobruk, which has a substantial army led by Russia-backed general Khalifa Haftar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has been locked in a brutal civil war since the British-backed removal of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, and remains divided between the two main rival governments and countless warring militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Widespread lawlessness has let people smugglers set up a ruthless trade kidnapping migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, and ransoming them or forcing them into labour and prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has issued repeated warnings over horrors including &quot;slave auctions&quot;, rape and torture awaiting migrants in the country, which make any attempt to forcibly return asylum seekers to its shores from international waters a violation of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrorist groups including al-Qaeda factions have capitalised on the ongoing power vacuum, with Isis still controlling pockets of territory despite losing its coastal stronghold of Sirte last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group made its presence brutally felt on Wednesday when militants massacred at least nine members of General Haftar's forces and two civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from its Amaq propaganda agency said 21 members of &quot;the Haftar militia&quot; were killed and wounded at a checkpoint in the central Jufra region, where the so-called Libyan National Army seized control of several strategic bases earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibility of Isis using Libya as a base to launch international terror attacks and regroup from its shrinking territories in Iraq and Syria has sparked alarm that increased after it emerged that the Manchester Arena bomber may have undergone terror training there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security situation in Libya is so dire that the FCO advises against all travel to any part of the country, and has urged all British nationals still present to leave immediately, having closed the Tripoli embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to restore stability and security to Libya, intense fighting continues in a number of areas and local security situations are fragile and can quickly deteriorate,&quot; the official advice reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. There remains a high threat throughout the country of terrorist attacks and kidnap against foreigners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is the danger that Mr Johnson's trip, the second in under six months, was not announced in advance under advice from Britain's security services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isis still controls parts of Libya(Reuters)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Secretary met Prime Minister Fayyez Al-Serraj, foreign minister Mohamed Siala and the President of Libya's High State Council Abdurrahman Swehli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An FCO statement said Mr Johnson &quot;underlined the importance of Libya's different political and social groups working together to overcome the current political conflict&quot; - a conflict that world leaders including Barack Obama have directly blamed the UK for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Secretary announced new funding including &pound;3m to remove improvised explosive devices left by Isis in Sirte, &pound;1m for de-mining training across Libya, &pound;1m to rebuild critical infrastructure and restore basic public services through the United Nations Development Programme, &pound;2.75m to support women's participation and &pound;1.29m to help displaced people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government has also agreed to increase its engagement with the Libyan law enforcement authorities to tackle organised crime and trafficking, building on the work the UK is already doing with European partners to strengthen the ability of the Libyan coastguard to secure its own borders in a manner which respects international law,&quot; a spokesperson said, adding that British training was focusing on &quot;human rights and the treatment of migrants&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research by Oxfam found that all but one of the women questioned had suffered sexual exploitation in Libya and three-quarters of people fleeing through the country had witnessed murder or torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is disturbing that Boris Johnson is talking about preventing people who are fleeing violence and destitution at home from leaving Libya,&quot; said Fionna Smyth, Oxfam's head of humanitarian campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aid for people travelling through Libya is welcome, but Britain should be helping them to find safety, not trapping them in a country where they face violence and abuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by UAE news agency WAM website on 23 October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UAE today participated in the &quot;Pledging Conference on the Rohingya Refugee Crisis&quot; at the European headquarters of the United Nations, UN, in Geneva, through a delegation headed by Maitha bint Salem Al Shamsi, Minister of State, with the participation of Obaid Salem Al Zaabi, UAE Permanent Representative to the UN and other International Organisations in Geneva, and Rashid Salem Al Shamsi, Director of the Foreign Assistance Affairs Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Al Shamsi gave the speech on behalf of the UAE at the conference, where she expressed, at the start, the country's utmost appreciation to Kuwait, the European Union, EU, and the UN, represented by its Secretary-General and its various organisations, most notably the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration, IOM, for organising this important event.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also expressed her appreciation to Bangladesh for its humanitarian stances, especially on the recent crisis involving over half a million Rohingya refugees during the previous weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also stressed that the atrocities committed against the Rohingya minority in Rakhine State in Myanmar is not only about refugees or displaced people who left their homes in search of security, but they are crimes that involve the killing and displacement of tens of thousands of innocent people, who were and are deprived of their basic rights in their own country, which expelled them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that the conditions and brutal practices endured by this minority is a disgrace to humanity, and do not meet the basic standards of humanitarian and ethical values, as well as the rights of minorities and the freedom of religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UAE asserted the need for the international community to take a unified stance and immediate action to stop these practices, and hold those responsible for them accountable, she remarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UAE observed that it was essential to continue supporting the United Nations in their efforts to put a stop to the violations and crimes suffered by the Muslim minority community, and work towards attaining security and peace in the Rakhine region of Myanmar by putting an end to all forms of violence and bloodshed in the region, she mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that the UAE was concerned about the issue and was one of the first countries to take action in this regard by dedicating all its capabilities to provide the necessary humanitarian support that would ease the suffering of the refugees. It facilitated an air bridge to send assistance, and sent teams to evaluate the humanitarian condition, besides providing the logistics support to international organisations working in the global humanitarian city of Dubai, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, she announced that the UAE has allocated an amount of 7 million US Dollars in order to support all the efforts aimed at easing the suffering of the Rohingya people and improving the conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She affirmed at the end of the UAE's speech that the country will continue to monitor and follow-up on the condition of the Rohingyas and support the efforts of international organisations fulfilling their humanitarian duty. She further hoped for the success of this conference in garnering support and shedding light on this crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference has succeeded in receiving monetary pledges worth 335 million US Dollars. The total value of humanitarian needs of the Rohingya refugees for a period of six months has reached 434 million US Dollars.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT must count as one of the most iconic pictures of this year, or of any in the tragedy of refugees crossing the Mediterranean into Europe, was published last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly out of the blue on golden sands, arrive some rigid inflatable boats, their shipload of African passengers with their dark skins and dark clothing contrasting with the mostly white holidaymakers in swimming costumes, some in bikinis strolling along the sunny sandy beach of Cadiz. They disappeared into the hinterland in a surreal haze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is just the huge dilemma facing politicians of all hues. What do they do, with the sudden arrival of masses of unexpected refugees on to home soil? We have tried sending Royal Navy ships to stop the influx, and a joint force of Mediterranean countries navies, have also tried. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been an attempt to destroy the smugglers boats, but all this has resulted in, I'm told, is that the smugglers are using more fragile and dangerous vessels for the crossings, making the lives of those trafficked  more precarious. Many thoughts leap to mind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How is it that those being sent across have managed to keep the thousands of pounds safe to pay the smugglers? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer maybe mobile phones and bank accounts, though they may have had some ready money plundered along the way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How  can the greed of mankind  prey on the vulnerable? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We read of them being held in captivity in places like Libya, before setting off for the shores of they know not where, maybe Italy, Malta, Sicily or Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some take a different route from the Horn of Africa to South Yemen, (a country I know having served in Aden with 45 Commando RM), aiming to reach Saudi Arabia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the way there they are intercepted and incarcerated and released in exchange for money, and when they are free and reach the Saudi border, we are told the Saudi Army opens fire on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems to me that one answer is to get the message home to their countries of origin that these crossings are futile, and they would serve their country better, as most are by definition the strong younger people, by staying put. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course we do not know what their friends and relatives are saying in sending back messages. Do they say Europe is the promised land, the risks are worth it? If so, how do we get the message across without seeming unbearably cruel? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had hoped the EU would have come up with a more effective foreign policy solution, but it was a challenge beyond its capability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I felt the EU  failed with the Bosnia/Balkans crisis to develop any kind of effective foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to know how much we as a country contributed to EU foreign policy. Clearly such an unwieldy body had trouble formulating any effective answers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I rather admire the Australian solution, of not letting trafficked people on to their mainland but sending them off to distant islands for processing, being nowhere near mainland Australia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee craft from SE Asia are intercepted and the refugees taken to these remote island camps. There they might have cooled off and conclude the risk wasn't worth it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course turning back to Europe, many do get through, and some reach the UK, and even get to Plymouth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can only admire The Devon and Cornwall Refugee Council's excellent work in assisting them in our city, not only with food and clothing but language teaching and helpful advice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have spare young men's and women's clothing - refugees are quite thin when they first arrive - you would be very welcome to bring them to their office at 7 Whimple St, or telephone 01752 265952, or go online at www.dcrs-plymouth.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I always try to write on how we can be a more decent and God-fearing people in Plymouth, usually to make it a better place for ourselves.  But if we can be seen to also be helping others in need, surely we are making Plymouth and its environs a more attractive, enjoyable, and distinctive area in which to live.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor welcomes the decision of the European Court of Justice, which confirms the agreed upon distribution of immigrant reception quotas in Europe, and rejects the appeal filed by Slovakia and Hungary for the in the wake of the migration crisis in 2015.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">GENEVA - Hungary and Slovakia have lodged an appeal against the plan and decision on refugee reception quotas adopted by European leaders in September 2015, which provides to distribute 120 thousand immigrants living in Italy and Greece to the countries of the European Union. On Wednesday, the court completely rejected the appeals made by Slovakia and Hungary, and assured that the plan condemned the two countries (when in fact they are supposed to reflect and express the spirit of European solidarity) only: &quot;contributes effectively to increase the burden on Greece and Italy after the influx of migrants in large numbers.<BR><BR>The Court considered that full unanimity among members is not binding to implement the decisions of the European Council, which included the 28 Heads of State and Government of the European Union, and that under no circumstances could the European Council change the voting rules established by treaties.<BR><BR>Hungary and Slovakia objected to the legitimacy of the plan, but the Court in return rejected their argument. The court considered issuing legislations by national parliaments without consultation with the European Parliament and without public hearings, non-legislative and the adoption of the resolution does not have to meet legislative requirements of National parliaments to be implemented.<BR><BR>Slovakia, Hungary, Czech Republic and Romania voted against receiving 120,000 refugees who arrived in Italy and Greece and met all international protection standards for two years.<BR><BR>The Euro-Med Monitor stresses the necessity of such decisions under the new European Union policies, which are exerting all efforts to stop the arrival of asylum seekers and migrants to Europe, and to legislate these acts through side agreements, escaping and disclaiming international laws and treaties on the issue of migrants and protection seekers.<BR><BR>Euro-Med considered the opposing countries' stances against the implementation of the resolution as &quot;immoral and is a representation of an attempt to evade responsibility in a manner that runs against international law.&quot;<BR><BR>Euro-Med calls on the European Union to make greater efforts to respect the rights of migrants and refugees, provide safe channels of access for refugees, and to bear the burden of refugees in cooperation with other countries.<BR><BR>World Trade Center II - c/o Regus Business Center Route de Pre-Bois 29<BR><BR>1215 Geneva-Switzerland<BR><BR>Email: geneva@euromedmonitor.org<BR><BR>Tel / Fax. +41 229295703<BR><BR>Mob. +41 76 297 50 19<BR><BR>Media Contact<BR><BR>Company Name: Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor<BR><BR>Contact Person: Dr Ramy Abdu<BR><BR>Email: info@euromedmonitor.org<BR><BR>Phone: +41 76 297 50 19<BR><BR>Country: Switzerland<BR><BR>Website: www.euromedmonitor.org<BR><BR>Source: www.abnewswire.com<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIVES IN LIMBO The refugees walked in a line among the olive trees, next to the razor-wire fence. Dawn was just breaking along the Syrian border with Turkey and families had already begun to queue at the crossing. Most adults carried nothing more than young children and a bag of spare clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were not Syrians fleeing to safety, however. After six years of a stillraging war, they were coming home. &quot;I'll try to make a life again for my family,&quot; said Mohammed, 33, who fled to Turkey last year from his home in Aleppo. Now, penniless after months unable to find work, he is taking his family back to live under the Assad regime in a neighbourhood that has been all but levelled in the fighting. &quot;I have to try. I have no other choice,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the only man in his family, Mohammed is exempt from conscription into the Syrian army and can return without fear of being drafted. But his house in Aleppo has been partially destroyed, and there is no electricity or water.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2011, 5m Syrians have fled the grinding civil war to safety in neighbouring countries. More than 1m have travelled to Europe, risking their lives to cross the Aegean in flimsy boats. Half a million have died and 6.3m are internally displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a tentative ceasefire has rendered large swathes of Syria safe from regime and Russian jets as well as rebel shelling. In a country that has been carved up into de facto zones of international influence, high-level geopolitical brokers are - just - keeping the peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As global powers fight over their country, many Syrians living in Turkey and Lebanon have decided that life in their unstable homeland is preferable to a precarious existence abroad, where work is hard to find, rents are expensive and the local bureaucracy is unfriendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the north of Syria, a Turkish-led military campaign last year secured what is in effect a no-fly zone in an area that extends 60 miles from Turkey's southern border. The Syrian regime, with help from its Russian, Lebanese and Iranian backers, has expanded and consolidated its hold over much of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kurdish areas an uneasy peace holds. By the Euphrates, which cuts across Syria from north to east, Isis commands an ever-shrinking area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, at the Bab al-Salam border crossing near Kilis, Turkey - 30 miles north of Aleppo - expectation hung in the air. Children stood grinning nervously in their best clothes, ready to meet long-lost relatives. Some were crossing for a few weeks, for the coming Eid al-Adha holiday; others were moving back permanently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would not, they said, be a joyful homecoming. &quot;It was difficult for us in Turkey. If it wasn't, why would we go back?&quot; said Rama, 35, who was taking her six children to the northern Syrian town of Azaz. &quot;We don't know what will happen to us. But life here was too hard. We didn't have money for food and rent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Turkey has taken more than 3m refugees, it has been criticised by human rights organisations for throwing up bureaucratic hurdles that make it difficult for Syrians to settle permanently there. Rama's family fled their home in Aleppo three years ago and settled in the Turkish border town of Gaziantep. But her husband struggled to find work, and they soon ran out of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After exhausting their savings, the family sold the last of their belongings and left for the northern Syrian city of Azaz last Thursday. Unlike in their flat in Turkey, they will not have electricity or running water, and will live under the constant threat of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our house in Aleppo was destroyed by an airstrike, but we'll stay with relatives,&quot; said Rama. &quot;At least we don't have expenditures there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the back of their dirty white van, her daughter Fatima, 16, cried silently as her younger siblings played. &quot;I'm desperate,&quot; she said, looking down at her silver trainers. &quot;I made a lot of friends in Turkey, and I went to school. I felt safe. Now I've said goodbye to everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her younger brothers do not remember anything of their life in Aleppo. But Fatima remembers the bombing and the fear. &quot;I'm scared,&quot; she said, as her family prepared to leave. &quot;I don't want to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first seven months of this year, 42,000 displaced Syrians returned home from abroad, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). A further 550,000 returned after being internally displaced, mostly to Aleppo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of Syrian refugees returning from Turkey is less clear, because many move both ways across the border. But thousands crossed into Syria this year during the holy month of Ramadan, when many come home to visit their relatives. Almost 700 left Turkey for Syria last Tuesday alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this unstable region, however, the line between voluntary and involuntary return is often blurred. Although people may technically go back on a voluntary basis, many say that they feel pushed to leave because they are unable to make a living in Turkey after failing to reach Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm jealous of my friends in Europe, but I have to go home,&quot; said Rashid, 18, as he gathered up his documents near the Kilis border crossing. &quot;My sister is in Germany, but the Turks caught me when I tried to go to Greece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After spending two years working in a textile factory in Istanbul, Rashid was planning to rejoin the rest of his family in Afrin, a Kurdish enclave in northwest Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the rival forces in Syria, the returning refugees are an important political prize. Opposition-leaning Syrians, rebel groups and some extremists are being herded into the northwestern Idlib province, after losing their last urban stronghold in east Aleppo following an intensely bloody and protracted battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week 3,000 more Syrians were moved from Lebanon to Idlib, a restive opposition-held area where al-Qaeda has a growing presence. Analysts and rights groups have questioned whether they were pressured to leave by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Islamist force that is a staunch ally of the Syrian regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a public relations move orchestrated by the regime and its allies so that they have the upper hand,&quot; said Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East programme at Chatham House, the London foreign policy think tank. &quot;The return of refugees is very much politicised. Each area that accepts these refugees is going to use that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not about the end of the conflict. It's a political move by competing actors inside Syria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IOM statistics, published in July, suggest the return of some refugees certainly does not herald the end of the war. They show the net number of displaced persons is still growing. This year, more than 200,000 Syrians have registered for temporary protection in Turkey alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if in the north of Syria there is a degree of voluntary return, in other areas there is not an option for refugees to refuse to return, because of the military pressure put on them,&quot; said one western diplomat working in the region. &quot;The conflict is absolutely not over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@louiseelisabet</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partner of a Vietnamese man who is scheduled to be deported from Australia on 1 January has pleaded with the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, to let him remain and help raise their 10-month-old child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HPN arrived in Australia by boat as a 12-year-old in 2010 and has lived for the past seven years in community detention in Perth with other asylum seekers who travelled as unaccompanied minors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He met his partner, Kesinee Kingrak, when they both attended Greenwood College high school and they began dating in 2014. Their daughter, Lily, was born in February and they planned to announce their engagement in the new year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His application for refugee status and subsequent review were rejected in 2011 and then reviewed again after a data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was taken from community detention to the Perth immigration detention centre on 22 December, the day before his 20th birthday. On Thursday his lawyers lodged a federal court application requesting a judicial review of his refugee application on the grounds that the initial rejection failed to consider all the relevant protocols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high court this month heard a challenge to the fast-track assessment process that applies to asylum seekers who arrive by boat, a later iteration of the non-statutory process used in HPN's case, which Legal Aid Victoria argued was &quot;fundamentally unfair&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Fast-track assessment fundamentally unfair to refugees, high court told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anna Copeland, a lawyer from Southern Community Advocacy Legal Education Service, wrote to Dutton last week requesting ministerial intervention to allow HPN to apply for a temporary partner visa to remain with Kingrak and Lily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Kingrak was very distressed at being forced to separate from HPN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Department of Home Affairs has said that because HPN is classified as an unauthorised maritime arrival, and his refugee claim was therefore assessed in a non-statutory process rather than by the migration tribunal, he does not meet any of the ordinary categories for ministerial intervention. As a boat arrival, he is also not eligible to apply for a visa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copeland is seeking an exemption under section 195A of the Migration Act 1958, which states that the minister may grant a visa of any class to a person who is held in immigration detention &quot;if the minister thinks that it is in the public interest to do so&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HPN told immigration authorities in 2010 that his parents, who are devout Catholics, had sent him away because the Vietnamese government reclaimed land belonging to their church and they feared he would be exposed to persecution. In an immigration interview, he said: &quot;My mother told me to go and don't come back.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He remains a practising Catholic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the immigration department, Copeland said deporting HPN would negatively impact Kingrak, a permanent resident, and Lily, an Australian citizen, by depriving them of his support and making Kingrak a single mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She requested he grant a temporary partner visa, which would allow HPN to work and live with Kingrak to apply for a permanent partner visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministerial guidelines for intervening in migration cases state that the minister has discretion to intervene where there are &quot;strong compassionate circumstances that if not recognised would result in serious, ongoing and irreversible harm and continuing hardship to an Australian citizen or an Australian family unit, where at least one member of the family is an Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has formed this little family and it is not good for any of them to be separated,&quot; Copeland said. &quot;It is unnecessary as he would clearly meet the criteria for a partner visa, as he and Kesinee have a genuine and continuing relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Copeland, HPN told Guardian Australia that he did not want to be separated from his daughter. He said that he helped Kingrak with Lily every day, despite his community detention order meaning they are unable to live together, and had taught her to sit up and wave goodbye. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  UN condemns Australia's forced return of asylum seeker to Sri Lanka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two earlier letters from the Labor MPs Tim Hammond, on behalf of HPN, and Anne Aly, on behalf of Kingrak, who lives in her electorate, requesting ministerial intervention have gone unanswered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If HPN is deported, Copeland said, it could be some years until he was cleared to reapply to enter Australia and able to afford the $8,000 fee to apply for a partner visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copeland said HPN's detention had already caused &quot;unnecessary suffering&quot;, including causing him to miss his daughter's first Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Department of Home Affairs said the department was unable to comment on individual cases, but that &quot;individuals who have exhausted all avenues to remain in Australia are expected to depart&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh has drawn up plans to dump 100,000 Rohingya refugees on a floodprone island far from shore, claiming they are a terrorist threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan has been condemned by aid workers who say the island is uninhabitable and did not even exist until 11 years ago, and fear it is a device to frighten people into going back to Burma.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already one of the world's most overcrowded countries, Bangladesh has been struggling to cope with the influx of 655,000 refugees since late August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most are crammed in the so-called mega-camp of Kutupalong, now the world's largest refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like creating a Manchester in three months on a very small amount of land,&quot; said Mohammad Abul Kalam, the Bangladeshi government's commissioner for refugee relief and repatriation. &quot;The strain on the local population is huge. Given the challenges, [the island is] not bad, though a little far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN and aid agencies have been calling for more land to extend the camp as well as to house 16,000 still trapped in no-man's-lands between Burma and Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Bangladeshi military has argued camps on the mainland are a security risk. &quot;Camps like this of vulnerable people are easy prey for extremists and may already harbour terrorists,&quot; said a senior military officer. &quot;Putting them on an island will separate them from our population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has approved a $280m (&pound;210m) plan to relocate 100,000 people to a remote island called Bhashan Char in the Bay of Bengal, about 20 miles from the mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mustafa Kamal, planning minister, said the project would be complete by 2019. Dutch technical experts have been brought in to advise on how to use lowlying land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But UN officials have called it &quot;uninhabitable&quot;, arguing it could disappear in the coming cyclone season and the surrounding sea is a major trafficking route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We and other humanitarian agencies are not keen on this idea,&quot; said Sultana Begum, Oxfam policy manager. &quot;[The island] would be hard to get aid to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month Bangladesh and Burma signed a deal to start returning Rohingya next month, to reduce pressure on camps. Some have likened it to sending victims back to a crime scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res estimates at least 6,700 Rohingya were slaughtered by Burmese military in the first month alone, including 730 children under the age of five. Earlier this month the UK foreign affairs select committee called it &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Oxfam study published tomorrow finds that despite the inadequacies of the camps, Rohingya said they would not return without guarantees of security and equal rights and some would rather die than go back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We interviewed 200 refugees and the overwhelming feeling from everyone was they are not ready,&quot; said Sultana Begum. &quot;They have only just arrived and are deeply traumatised, having been raped, knifed and seen loved ones killed. I had women saying they would rather commit suicide than go back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">638  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE stood there, rooted to the spot, disbelieving, trying to survey the nightmarish scenes of desperation before him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children so hungry they simply couldn't stand. Mothers, eyes red from crying. Men, broken by grief. Tents stretching out as far as the eye could see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing could have prepared Lord Foulkes for the horrors endured by these Rohingya refugees in a sprawling, disease-infested camp that has now swelled larger than both Edinburgh and Glasgow combined.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were standing there,&quot; he said, &quot;next to a tarpaulin sheet that stretched from the fence to the side of the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huddled beneath it were two families, two families living there. Not really living, just trying to exist. They slept there, they ate there, they barely survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm well travelled, I've been around and seen many, many tough things in my lifetime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I have to be honest - this is the worst I've ever seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was all I could do not to cry in front of them. They just have no hope, it's been snatched from them. The world has to do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who knows George Foulkes, the long-serving Edinburgh politician and former Hearts chairman, will recognise all too well the mighty roar of his laugh and width of his grin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not many, though, will have experienced the haunting drawl or steely eye he has when left shocked to the core. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was part of a group of six MPs and other foreign politicians in Bangladesh with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, when they asked to visit the border region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They wanted to see for themselves what had become of the people forced out of Myanmar and were driven to Cox's Bazaar. Located just a few miles over the border from Myanmar, the former port town has become the epicentre of the current refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Foulkes said: &quot;Before we left we heard there were 600,000 refugees there. When we got there, we found out that was now 826,000 people - that's more than the populations of Edinburgh and Glasgow combined - the size of Scotland's largest two cities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was staggering. There were tents, and canopies and people as far as the eye could see in every direction. No schools, no toilets, no infrastructure - no hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people we spoke to told us it will reach a million refugees by Christmas. And they are being left here, forgotten by the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They stopped serving hot food, because they were worried about an outbreak of diarrhoea,  they are worried about dysentery and other disease, they are worried about malnutrition, they are worried about the floods, and about mud slides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But malnutrition - this is what they are worried about most. They are not getting food. Bangladesh is already one of the world's most impoverished countries, and now they are trying to cope with this. They simply cannot cope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on his fellow citizens in Edinburgh and across Scotland to do what they can to help. He said: &quot;The charities are mobilising, we have Sciaf, the Disasters Emergency Committee, Save the Children and others all seeking donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd read about this crisis, like most people back home watched it on the TV. But  nothing had me prepared for how dire a situation this is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd urge people to give what they can. If they can't do that, they can write to their MPs and others, and ask them to ensure we do more for these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees spoke about the slaughter they left, the arrests and violence, of how women and children perished along with the men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foulkes added: &quot;The ethnic killings, the genocide - for that's what it is - has to stop. But until it does the world has to take notice and do all it can to help. Because these people have nowhere to go, nowhere to turn and no hope. They have nothing except us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UK has already donated to the cause, but it's not enough. Other countries also have to get involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'ALISON&quot;, she says. It's close to midnight. I am sitting with one of my oldest friends, my penfriend from German school exchanges, at her kitchen table. She had just picked me up from the airport. We are both bubbling with the happiness of being together and the gratuitous amazement that this short visit has been possible. &quot;Alison. I have something to tell you.&quot; she says, with a seriousness, &quot;my life has changed completely in the last two months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last 25 years I've seen very little of her, busy as we were with family life, and just Christmas cards holding the space. Then social media came along and helped, in the way it can. She knew of my struggles to have children of my own, of my work, our fostering of an Eritrean child and the long struggles for justice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She'd been gently alongside from afar, witnessing an experience that was unimaginable to her. We are very different people, with very different lives and experiences. Calm, measured, work and family life in rural Germany compared to mine as an academic, writer and activist. When she visited me for her daughter's 18th birthday treat and saw how wonderfully our daughters hit it off, being of a similar age, the friendship took on a new dimension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've become a mother to a refugee boy &quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had wondered before arriving how she would have experienced the new Germany, the one which has just welcomed more than one million refugees. Angela Merkel's change of heart and decision to take in refugees in the event of a war on the borders of Europe was one of determination to uphold the articles, signed up to by her country as an EU member state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany was largely isolated in Europe in this decision. The majority of states ignored the binding agreements they, too, had signed up to upon joining. The UK went a whole xenophobic step further and voted for Brexit. But Germany has, once again, transformed itself, and for the better. Every village, every parish, every town and city in Germany has refugees and asylum seekers dispersed to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wir schaffen das&quot; - &quot;we can do it&quot; has not found a welcome everywhere in Germany, and, as in the UK, the areas with the least diversity have shown the greatest hostility. There are numerous issues with the macro-structures and politics of this move but what is important, to me as a researcher, is how it is experienced in people's lives and homes. It's here that the politics of a country are first made, because all homes are political. And it's not a complex thing. It's either a step into greater love or into greater hate. Neutrality is not possible in the face of the need or the suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out comes an album of photographs, the son's name, the necessary language of refugee politics and bureaucracy, is starting to form in her speech, but also, beautifully, talk of volunteering and welcoming, of football tournaments and swimming galas, of mutual language learning, and of stories of experiences they are sharing together. I have rarely seen her so determined, clear, alive, so completely at home in her skin, and proud of her children's response. Her husband - shy, steady - is alight with a liveliness and quiet certainty about the rightness of this, their new family relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the risk of love. They just stepped up when the need presented itself in a personal way, and did so despite fears which circulate all the time in our media telling us not to care, not to trust but instead to demonise, insult and dismiss, to render destitute, to detain and to deport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she tells her story I am finding it hard not to cry. Beauty does this to me when it expresses itself fully and in balance with natural justice. Night passes into a new day and we step purposefully into the stride of our friendship in these rare moments of being in the same time and space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A walk round a town where shop windows, faces, and the silence of a cathedral are now all occasions for stories about the children who found us both. We first walked these streets together when I was 14. Thirty-six years on, since her hospitality profoundly changed my disturbed and lonely young life, its grace was coming full circle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening brings a meal together at home. Language is loosened into the simplest words in a multilingual kitchen alive with Maninka, Wolof, German, French and English. We are all practising speaking everything. It's a celebration, so groundnut stew and thick gunpowder tea are on the menu, and the new son is charge. The air is as thick with stories as the tea is with sugar. Every now and then we lapse into the languages that are easiest for us to share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eating each other's food, sharing in each other's stories, touching each other naturally, as families do, with affection, in tenderness and in jest, celebrating each others' lives, giving of wisdom and knowledge back and forth. Yes, there is grief in the stories on all sides, but the way the family is re-forming is a matter of adventure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Syrian resettlement programme began in Scotland two years ago I was one of those advocating on practical grounds, for it to be concentrated in the central belt, and particularly Glasgow, because that was where the experience of integrating reasonably well had developed through the years of dispersal, largely through trial and error, and a good deal of error at that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could see how little experience, capability and capacity there was in local councils with none of Glasgow's particular refugee and asylum story. Witnessing the new Germany - yet another new Germany - I realise I was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see the changes, which are coming across Scotland through the community work of integrating, though with much less opportunity for full participation due to the tiny numbers of refugees the UK is taking in comparatively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not a complicated thing, integration is the very back and forth, the give and the take of hospitality when it's in full flow. It's a place at a table, with food as part of the common task of making a new society, together. This does not mean I must meld my life to every stranger, just if occasion allows and I am prepared to put myself in a place where I can be found, to a particular stranger who may occasion across my path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My friend's family are as &quot;German&quot; as they ever were. They haven't lost anything. They have simply expanded their sphere of love.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manfred Weber urged the European Commission to support Hungary to secure its borders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's Manfred Weber, the leader of the Centre-right European People's Party group, wants Hungary to receive financial support to help battle the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I understand that [Prime Minister Viktor] Orb&aacute;n is requesting financial support for the country's border security because it contributed to tackling the migration crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hungary controls the EU external borders for others. The European Commission cannot simply dismiss a request like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary fortified its borders with Serbia and EU state Croatia with a fence, police and troops, and says it is protecting the rest of EU from illegal migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  'Italy cannot support everyone' Furious backlash at Pope's demand f...  German Election - Merkel demands migrant crisis 'never be repeated' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 1.7 million refugees and migrants have reached EU shores through the perilous Mediterranean crossing since 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Weber said that Brussels also supports countries such as Bulgaria and Italy in dealing with the crisis and he believes that this should be widened to include Hungary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that Mr Orban would have to play his part by working with other EU states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;Solidarity is not a one-way street. I think it is important that Viktor Orb&aacute;n now acknowledge how crucial solidarity is between EU states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Court of Justice is set to rule on Wednesday whether European countries must agree uphold refugee quotas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary has fortified its borders with Serbia and EU state Croatia with a fence, and police wit dogs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came after ex-communist EU state Slovakia and Hungary challenged a 2015 decision to relocate 160,000 refugees across EU states, had no legal basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refusal by Hungary, as well as its ally Poland, to take in a single asylum-seeker under a 2015 EU scheme has infuriated Brussels, Berlin and Paris, and many other EU states, triggering a broader debate in the bloc about key values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An initial indication from the court suggests the two east European countries are set for a resounding defeat, which could also lead to hefty fines being imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahead of the ruling, Hungary said it would ask the European Commission for about 400 million euros to cover half of the cost Hungary has incurred for border management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 1.7 million refugees and migrants have reached EU shores through the perilous Mediterranean </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission refused the request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman said: &quot;We do support border management measures at the external borders. This can be surveillance measures. It can be border control equipment... But fences, we do not finance,&quot; said spokesman Alexander Winterstein</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overwhelmed by chaotic arrivals in 2015, the bloc has tightened its migration policies and external borders, but many still see Hungary's fences as inhumane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They accuse Hungarian Prime Minister Orban of not showing enough solidarity with Italy and Greece, the main states of arrival in the EU, as well as Germany and other wealthy members of the bloc which take in most of those people who make it to Europe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO doctors have described working in one of the world's largest refugee camps as &quot;desperate&quot; and &quot;heartbreaking&quot;. Zubair Wani and Haroon Ali travelled to Turkey for six days with three other doctors as part of a wider group of 12 humanitarian workers with the United Aid Network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University (ABMU) health board employees Dr Wani, a trainee GP currently working in palliative care in Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, and Dr Ali, a junior doctor in orthopaedics in Morriston Hospital in Swansea, went to the Adana camp in their own time and at their own expense.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctors, both from Swansea, raised more than &pound;15,000 before travelling over. Medical supplies including antibiotics, painkillers, creams and dressings, were donated and carried out to the camp - which home to more than 5,000 Syrian refugees - in suitcases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ali said what he saw was devastating: &quot;The situation was desperate. Living conditions were extremely poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Around 10 people would live on the floors of makeshift tents. These people hadn't seen a doctor for years. We encountered a wide variety of conditions, from primary care to problems caused by the living conditions which were hygiene related. &quot;A lot of the children were dehydrated, malnourished and had fevers. It's difficult to guess how many patients we saw but it was probably hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tried our best with limited resources and were able to diagnose and treat simple diseases, as well as give advice to more chronic problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once word got around there were doctors at the camp, a huge queue of people quickly built up outside the tent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Wani struggled to cope with temperatures of around 40&deg;C, despite having air conditioning - a luxury none of the camp residents enjoyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women and children worked the fields in the sweltering heat to support their families,&quot; he said. &quot;The toilets consisted of a small tent with a hole in the ground flanked by two sandbags, with waste collecting on the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were flies collecting on the other side, and these flies were also in contact with people's food. Needless to say, the potential for disease was evident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this, Dr Zubair said, the Syrians were some of the most welcoming people he had ever met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given their unfortunate circumstances, they insisted we have tea on each visit, and prepared large meals for us. This presented a dilemma, as I could only guess how many days' worth of food they had selflessly prepared, but at the same time it is seen as disrespectful to refuse food when offered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as running the clinic they also worked in a warehouse, organising equipment and making up four tons' worth of food packs for distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctors said the work was not over as the war showed no sign of ending soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Wani said the other doctors at the Princess of Wales Hospital were hoping to coordinate a regular medical mission to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would like to extend our sincere thanks to ABMU and all of our donors who supported us,&quot; Dr Ali added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their help was greatly appreciated by the refugees. Every donation made such a big difference to those people that it is impossible to convey in words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are now 4.9 million refugees left homeless by the Syrian civil war. Poverty, poor sanitation and the risk of disease are rife in camps such as those around the city of Adana in southern Turkey where the doctors worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These camps are home to around 7,000 men, women and children, all unregistered refugees with no access to food, water, shelter, healthcare or education.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims, an informal fleet of small wooden fishing boats has meant deliverance from what they say is an indiscriminate assault on their villages by the Burmesearmy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deliverance, however, comes at a price. Some refugees told theReuters news agencythey paid as much as 10,000 taka (&pound;90) per adult to boatmen to make the five-hour crossing from Burma'scoast to ports in southern Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the fishermen say they have a moral obligation to help desperate fellow Muslims escaping persecution, Bangladeshi officials accuse them of profiteering. Ordered to stamp out what they call human trafficking, they have made arrests and even set fire to fishing boats.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course we want to keep going back to rescue more people. Our Muslim brothers and sisters are in a bad situation, so I have to go and bring them,&quot; said Mohammed Alom, 25, a fisherman in the Bangladeshi village of Shamlapur.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bodies of Rohingya children 'shot dead by Burma police' found by river</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 400,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh in less than three weeks and people are still coming, by land as well as by sea, after attacks by Rohingya militants sparked a fierce counteroffensive by Burma'sarmy. Senior UNofficials have described the violence as &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influx is placing huge strain on authorities in southern Bangladesh, one of the poorest parts of a poor country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't say rescuers. The rescuers should be going and they should rescue people, not in terms of money,&quot; said Lieutenant Colonel Ariful Islam, Border Guards Bangladesh commander in Teknaf on the country's southern tip, referring to the fishermen bringing refugees ashore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people are very poor, it's just extorting from them whatever they have. We are helping those who arrived, but we're trying to insist that no human trafficking should take place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters interviewed three Rohingya fishermen and two Bangladeshi boat owner-operators, all of whom had made at least two visits to Burmain recent weeks. The men didn't believe the profits they made detracted from what they saw as a rescue mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaif Ullah, 34, a Bangladeshi, who co-owns a fishing boat, said he made 100,000 taka (&pound;900) rescuing the family of a Rohingya in Malaysia who paid him via BKash, a popular mobile money service, after he returned to Bangladeshi shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People from Malaysia and Saudi Arabia call me and tell me to go there to get their family,&quot; he said. &quot;They are crying for my help. I take money from them, yes, but it's also a humanitarian act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two refugees have told Reuters their family members were detained by fishermen or brokers in Bangladesh when they could not pay for the journey. Several also complained they had to hand over gold and other jewellery to boat operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had no chance to negotiate with the boatmen,&quot; said Ali Johar, 75, an elder from his village in southern Maungdaw, just across the Naf river that forms the border between Burmaand Bangladesh, now staying in Shamlapur.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we are grateful to the fishermen for bringing us here,&quot; he said. &quot;There were so many people trying to get here. If they didn't bring us, we would be stuck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pronay Chakma says it was a &quot;stroke of fate&quot; that thrust him into a key role in Bangladesh's response to the crisis. The 31-year-old administrator arrived in Teknaf to start a new job as sub-district assistant commissioner for land on 23 August, two days before northwestern Burmaexploded into violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing is that, yes, the fishermen can go there, no problem, but if they demand money from the pain of stricken people, is it humanitarian? No,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chakma - a Buddhist member of the Chakma tribe who live scattered throughout South Asia - is an executive magistrate, which means he can hand down jail terms in simple criminal cases. He interrupted an interview with Reuters to sentence a man to three months for possession of five methamphetamine tablets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chakma and another local official have sentenced at least 100 people to terms of up to six months for continuing to charge Rohingya refugees for ferrying them to safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each and every time we are warning them,&quot; he said. &quot;Yes, you can do that, but not in exchange of money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed to the deaths of women and children who, unable to swim, have died after their boats capsized near Bangladeshi shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fishermen and local residents told Reuters that authorities have also broadcast messages in their villages by loudspeaker ordering them not to pick up Rohingyas. At least five boats caught bringing refugees in exchange for money have been set on fire on the beach by officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boatmen Reuters spoke to said they were cautious about operating in bad weather and rejected allegations of coercion or detaining refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of thousands of people may still be waiting to cross the mouth of the Naf river, according to estimates by refugees, fishermen and rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to go back to bring these people, because Muslims are suffering,&quot; said Bangladeshi boat owner Moni Ullah, 38. &quot;For me, it's hard to sit here and not go there, because I have seen so many people crying on the beach.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday that a Somali refugee charged with ramming his car into a Canadian  policeman, stabbing him and then injuring four people while leading officers on a high-speed chase over the weekend was ordered deported from the U.S. in 2011.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennifer Elzea, an ICE spokeswoman, said Hasan Sharif Abdulahi was taken into ICE's custody in San Diego in July of that year and in September an immigration judge ordered him sent back to Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elzea said Sharif was released from custody two months later then failed to report as ordered for his removal on January 24, 2012.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said efforts to locate him were unsuccessful.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said Sharif had no known criminal history at the time of his encounters with ICE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharif now faces 11 charges in Canada, including five of attempted murder in the Saturday night attack in Edmonton, Alberta.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have raised the possibility of filing terrorism charges against Sharif because there was an Islamic State flag in his car and he was investigated in 2015 for espousing extremist views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Sharif, 30, entered Canada legally in 2012 and obtained refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Canadian official said Sharif entered Canada from the U.S. The official insisted on speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ICE listed Sharif's name with slightly different spelling, Abdullahi Hassan Sharif. But the Canadian official and a U.S. government official both said it is the same man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A preliminary hearing for Sharif opened Tuesday but was recessed so he can find a lawyer.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appeared on closed-circuit television and followed proceedings with the help of an interpreter. The suspect spoke briefly with a lawyer who stepped forward to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing was held over until November 14, but could resume sooner if Sharif can hire a lawyer before then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edmonton police say they believe Sharif acted alone during the series of attacks, which began around 8:15pm on Saturday as police Constable Mike Chernyk was handling crowd control outside a Canadian Football League game at a stadium just northeast of downtown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chernyk was hit by a speeding white Chevy Malibu that rammed through a barrier and sent him flying through the air.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver got out, pulled out a large knife and began stabbing Chernyk as he lay on the ground. The officer fought back, and the suspect fled on foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chernyk suffered cuts on his face and scrape on his arms but was released from a hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police distributed the name and physical description of the Malibu's registered owner and set up roadblocks, and officers stopped the suspect, now driving a U-Haul truck, hours later at a checkpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver took off toward downtown with police in high-speed pursuit, and the truck struck four pedestrians along the way.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chase continued until the truck crashed on its side. Officers used a stun gun on the driver and took him into custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the four pedestrians remain hospitalized, one with a fractured skull.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Greek Cypriot news agency CNA on 11 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Unattributed report: &quot;Turkey has to implement the Third Vienna Agreement, says acting government spokesman&quot;]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey has an obligation to proceed with the implementation of the Third Vienna Agreement, Acting Government Spokesman Victoras [Viktoras] Papadopoulos has stressed, adding that Ankara must also end its military occupation of the Republic's northern areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Invited by CNA to comment on reports in the Turkish Cypriot press that planning is underway for the members of the Maronite community to begin returning to their villages in the Turkish occupied areas, he said &quot;we should wait to see if they will go ahead with what they have said they would do, namely allow Maronites to return to their villages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to wait and see if they will go ahead with their pledges, ie to demilitarise the maronite villages and allow the Maronites to return. It is Turkey's obligation to proceed with this action according to the Third Vienna Agreement which it has never implemented,&quot; he told CNA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papadopoulos said that Turkey should take similar steps with regard to refugees from the Karpass peninsula and the rest of the refugees as well. &quot;This action does not lift the illegality and the violation of international law that exists as Ankara's occupation continues,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey, he pointed out, cannot be absolved by merely allowing the Maronites to return to their homes. &quot;It must end the occupation and allow all refugees to return to their homes&quot;, Papadopoulos stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remarks to CyBC at Pedoulas village on Thursday [10 August], President Nicos Anastasiades [Nikos Anastasiadis] clarified that Maronites were never prohibited from returning to their communities in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960, the Maronites had to choose to belong either to the Greek Cypriot or the Turkish Cypriot Community. The Maronites opted to join the Greek Cypriot Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the Turkish invasion in 1974, the Maronites became refugees and the four Maronite villages namely Kormakitis, Karpashia, Asomatos and Agia Marina Skyllouras lie in the Turkish occupied area of the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the second phase of the Turkish invasion in August 1974, about 20,000 Greek Cypriots and Maronite Cypriots living in villages and townships primarily in the Karpass Peninsula of northeast Cyprus and in villages west of the city of Kyrenia remained behind the ceasefire line. These persons are known as the &quot;enclaved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 2 August 1975, at the conclusion of UN sponsored intercommunal talks the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities Glafcos Clerides [Glafkos Kliridis] and Rauf Denktash respectively, reached an agreement known as the &quot;Third Vienna Agreement&quot; addressing important humanitarian aspects affecting the lives of the enclaved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement provided that Greek Cypriots at present in the north of the island were free to stay. They were to be given every help to lead a normal life, including facilities for education and for the practice of religion as well as medical care by their own doctors. They were entitled to free movement in the north of Cyprus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Third Vienna Agreement however was violated by Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot regime. Since 1974, the enclaved have endured conditions of hardship and oppression because of their ethnicity, language and religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble,&nbsp;Germany's veteran finance minister, agreed to become the speaker of parliament on Wednesday, in the first decisive step towards forming a new government as coalition negotiations fractured over immigration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Merkel, the&nbsp;German&nbsp;chancellor, will hope that Mr Sch&auml;uble, 75, who is deeply respected in&nbsp;Germany&nbsp;for helping steer the eurozone through the debt crisis, can impose order on a fractious parliament that includes six parties after Sunday's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel is attempting to form a three-party coalition government after her own conservative CDU/CSU bloc lost support and the anti-immigrant Alternative for&nbsp;Germany&nbsp;(AfD) entered parliament for the first time in half a century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sch&auml;uble's exit means that the finance ministry could go the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) or possibly the Green Party as part of coalition talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FDP, who are as fiscally hawkish as Mr Sch&auml;uble, have said they want his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Angela Merkel wins fourth term in German elections       01:03</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Bundestag president, Mr Sch&auml;uble will not be involved in coalition negotiations, removing one strong-minded negotiator from the table and potentially giving Mrs Merkel a freer hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A deal with the FDP and the Greens is Mrs Merkel's only realistic coalition option, but the parties disagree on issues including energy, taxation, Europe and migration, complicating the path to a so-called &quot;Jamaica&quot; coalition - a reference to the parties' respective colours: black, yellow and green.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the Green Party said it would refuse an &quot;upper limit&quot; to the number of refugees entering the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our political compass is refugee protection and human rights, so recognised refugees should be able to catch up with their families,&quot; said Simone Peter, Green party leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel is under pressure from her own party to set an upper limit on migration, after it lost votes to the AfD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel is picking her way through delicate negotiations after a poor result for her traditional coalition partner pushed them into oppositonCredit:      Getty     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel, who defended her &quot;open door&quot; refugee policy earlier this summer, told voters during a television event in the run-up to the election that she did not believe a cap on refugees would be &quot;practical&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the FDP leader said his party will only join an alliance with Mrs Merkel if there is a change in the direction of government policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are glorifying Jamaica as a romantic political project,&quot; Christian Lindner told Die Welt daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is, there is an arithmetical majority, but the four parties each have their own election mandates. Whether these can be allied without contradiction and in the interests of the country remains to be seen,&quot; he said, adding that if in doubt, his party would remain in opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AfD party is also dealing with the fallout after Frauke Petry, the former face of the AfD, theatrically walked out of a party press conference on Monday to protest against its bitter infighting and radicalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was speculation in the&nbsp;German&nbsp;media over whether she will form a new &quot;Blue Party&quot;, after&nbsp;German&nbsp;newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine, uncovered a web domain of that name, which had been registered by Mrs Petry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the rumours, Mrs Petry has said that &quot;blue&quot; embodies an idea, but not yet a party name.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, some 87,000 Rohingya Muslims have entered Bangladesh, fleeing violence which erupted on August 25.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The asylum seekers have filled three older refugee camps set up in the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN spokeswoman Vivian Tan said: &quot;The existing refugees have taken in the new arrivals into their homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands more are sheltering in local villages, or in open fields - wherever they could find space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Tan said: &quot;What we desperately need is for land to be made available to get more emergency shelters up,&quot; as well as help with other aid supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people have been walking for days. They likely have not eaten since they left their homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many needed medical attention for respiratory diseases, infections and malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are exhausted, they are traumatised ... There are babies, some newborns, who've been exposed to the elements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, at the Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital about two hours from the border, doctors were treating 31 men who arrived &quot;distressed and afraid&quot; with broken bones and bullet wounds, mostly to their limbs, according to the resident medical officer Dr Shaheen Abdur Rahman Choudhury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They all told similar stories of Burmese soldiers opening fire randomly on their villages in western Burma on August 26-27 and setting buildings aflame, Dr Choudhury said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital, already &quot;hugely overburdened,&quot; expects to receive many more wounded refugees, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violence and the exodus began on August 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked Burma police and paramilitary posts in what they said was an effort to protect their ethnic minority from persecution by security forces in the majority-Buddhist country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the military unleashed what it called &quot;clearance operations&quot; to root out the insurgents. The violence led the UN World Food Programme last week to halt aid deliveries to some 250,000 people in Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest violence is part of an ongoing struggle between Burma's minority Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists. Bloody rioting that erupted in 2012 forced more than 100,000 Rohingya into displacement camps in Bangladesh, where many still live today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Pakistani rights advocate Malala Yousafzai condemned the violence against Rohingya, in a Twitter statement. &quot;I am still waiting for my fellow Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to do the same,&quot; she said of Burma's leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security officials and Rohingya insurgents have accused each other of atrocities. The military has said nearly 400 people, most of them insurgents, have died in clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh police said dozens of Rohingya have died attempting to cross the river separating the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma's government blames the insurgents for burning their own homes and killing Buddhists in Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the hospital in Cox's Bazar on Monday, Rohingya refugees who had been treated for bullet wounds recalled the violent events across the border differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammad Irshad, 27, said he saw at least eight bodies after his village near the coastal town of Maungdaw was visited by at least 30 soldiers, who he said opened fire indiscriminately before setting fire to homes and other buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixteen-year-old Mohammed Osama said he had tried to flee into the nearby forest when soldiers entered his village on August 26, but instead was shot by one of them in the thigh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a gaping bullet wound in his leg, he was carried by his father and some of his 11 siblings across the border. His family joined thousands now packed into the Bangladeshi fishing village of Shah Porir Dwip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet another village near Maungdaw, in Burma, was destroyed by about 50 soldiers, according to 25-year-old Rohingya villager Mohammad Arafat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I started running when the firing started and lost track of both my parents. I don't know if they're dead or alive,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're cutting up people, shooting people. I'm very afraid. I never want to go back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife and mother-in-law were sheltering in the border area of Teknaf, but Mr Arafat sought treatment for his wound.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a beaming Pope Francis swapped the Popemobile for a brightly painted rickshaw towards the end of his six-day trip to Burma and Bangladesh, Rohingya refugees just an hour's flight away in Kutupalong camp were struggling to understand why he could not also board a helicopter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope came all the way from Rome - he should have come here,&quot; said Mohammad Hussein, 18, gesturing at what is fast turning into the world's largest refugee camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussein escaped from Burma with his mother and three siblings after their village was attacked and his father's throat slit. Now they live in a hut of plastics sheets, cardboard and bamboo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope is a big leader who everyone listens to,&quot; he said. &quot;The Burmese government is killing our people, raping our women and stopping our children going to school. If he had come face to face with us here he would have seen our suffering and how we have been oppressed and tortured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kefayet Ullah, another refugee, complained: &quot;The Pope always used to address Muslims as brothers, but now it seems we don't matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said that because the papal trip was organised before the Rohingya crisis started, the Bangladeshi authorities could not facilitate the complicated logistical and security challenges of visiting Kutupalong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet from the young man having a &quot;Neymar&quot; cut in a makeshift barber's shop to the grandfather trying to weigh live chickens on a scale and the mullah calling to prayers in a hilltop mosque, everyone in the camp seemed to know about the Pope's visit to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he is an outspoken advocate for refugees, the plight of the Rohingya cast a long shadow over his trip. There was disappointment in the camp when he did not even use the word Rohingya in Burma on the first leg of the trip, despite global condemnation of what the UN has called &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vatican advisers, apparently fearful of reprisals against Burma's small Catholic minority, for whom the trip was originally planned, claimed it was more important to build bridges with the Burmese government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism abated when, after a multifaith meeting in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, on Friday, the pontiff met 16 Rohingya. &quot;We won't close our hearts. We won't look away,&quot; he assured them in a trembling voice, visibly moved as he held their hands and listened to their stories. After touching the head of a young girl whose entire family was killed, he added: &quot;The presence of God today is also called Rohingya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the camp, however, this was not enough for Sanjida, 25, who took 11 days to escape from Burma by foot and boat with her four children and grandmother after her husband was killed. &quot;Everyone here is talking about Pope Francis and we are happy he is taking our side but we can't understand why he can't come here and see how we are living,&quot; she said. &quot;We thought the Pope was here for us so it was very disappointing that he did not come and see us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pope spent some of his final hours in Dhaka yesterday visiting a home for the destitute founded by Mother Teresa. And as darkness fell last night in Kutupalong, some Rohingya came out to see the almost full moon, saying it made them happy even in the midst of such hardship. Yet still there was regret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammad Kashim, 24, who arrived two months ago, said: &quot;We're so frustrated the Pope left without visiting the camp. If his visit to both countries was to try to help solve the problem and make peace, then he should have come to see what miserable conditions we're in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">EBRD and donors provide EUR53.24 million to upgrade wastewater services for local residents, including refugees<BR><BR>Over 100,000 residents in 15 towns in the western part of Jordan's Irbid governorate, of whom 18 per cent are Syrians, will have sanitation services for the first time in the area.<BR><BR>Continuing the EBRD's efforts to improve Jordan's infrastructure, through its Municipal Resilience Refugee Response Framework, the Bank will finance a EUR53 million investment for the benefit of the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) to upgrade its wastewater network.<BR><BR>The proximity of the city of Irbid to the Syrian border has resulted in a significant number of Syrian refugees resettling in Irbid and nearby towns. Population growth in the area has put unprecedented strain on the wastewater network, placing extra pressure on the outdated infrastructure for wastewater collection, particularly in the towns outside of the city.<BR><BR>The Bank's financing will contribute to the construction of a wastewater network serving 15 towns, located in western areas of Irbid governorate. This will include the infrastructure for a catchment area of 21.9 km2 and the installation of pumping stations to connect the towns to the new network and to existing treatment plants at Wadi Al Arab.<BR><BR>KfW, the German development bank, and Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) are also implementing a parallel investment that will rehabilitate the water and wastewater networks in other parts of Irbid governorate.<BR><BR>The project will be made possible with grant co-financing support of US$ 2.5 million from the World Bank's Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) and EUR5.9 million from the EBRD Shareholder Special Fund.<BR><BR>Jordan's population is expected to double by 2050, and the country already faces extremely scarce water resources and poor wastewater infrastructure. Currently, only 63 per cent of the population have access to wastewater collection or treatment systems.<BR><BR>Heike Harmgart, EBRD Regional Head of the Eastern Mediterranean and Head of the Resident Office in Amman, said: 'We are delighted to continue our strong partnership with WAJ and to help the government advance its resilience and refugee response programme. The EBRD's investment will enable remote areas to be connected for the first time to the wastewater network; this will not only benefit the local community but also Syrian refugees living in Jordan. These projects will help relieve strained municipal services in Irbid and strengthen the resilience of the country as a whole.'<BR><BR>Hazim El-Naser, Minister of Water and Irrigation, stressed the importance of this financing which is part of the Jordan Response Plan 2018-2020 and will improve the local sanitation conditions in 15 large towns in western Irbid, protect valuable groundwater sources in that area, and eventually contribute to increased treated wastewater for use in agriculture in the Jordan Valley thus allowing the release of more freshwater (currently used in agriculture) for municipal use.<BR><BR>As part of its country strategy for Jordan, the EBRD strives to develop and implement a comprehensive wastewater investment programme in order to resolve the country's difficulties in the sector, caused by rapid population growth, and the presence of 1.3 million Syrians. The western Irbid wastewater project is the third of its kind to be implemented by the EBRD in Jordan.<BR><BR>Since Jordan joined the EBRD in 2012, the Bank has invested US $ 1 billion in 41 projects benefiting various sectors of the country's economy.<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to the Jungle. Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson were the young Oxford graduates who built a theatre in this unofficial refugee and migrant camp in Calais. They called it the Good Chance - the term refugees use when feeling that the odds are favourable for them to make it across the Channel - and it became a symbol of hope.Now the pair make their playwriting debut with this remarkable work that pulls you into the life of the camp, charting its story from inception to final eviction. It manages to be sharp and undeceived about what happens when refugees from a wide variety of backgrounds meet well-meaning volunteers from the UK.But it's also an exceptionally moving celebration of how the people set aside their differences, creating a world that, albeit cold, muddy and scary, was a tribute to tremendous resourcefulness and resilience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superlative staging by Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin - a co-production between the Young Vic, the National and Good Chance Theatre - invites you to take a seat in a space that has been transformed into the camp's thriving Afghan restaurant which served traditional food. It received a laudatory </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> review from AA Gill (who extolled a particular dish &quot;that defied the surroundings and at the same time elevated them...&quot;) and a five-star write-up on TripAdvisor. Miriam Buether's excellent immersive set is a deliberately makeshift affair of chip wood and tarpaulin. The tables become a network of raised walkways on which the actors perform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 18-strong company, brilliantly cast, let you hear a rich diversity of voices. Among them, there's Salar (Ben Turner), the diehard Afghan who built the restaurant (on behalf of which there was a peaceful protest against the bulldozers when it was the only structure in the camp that had not been moved to the &quot;safe&quot; zone). Our sad, gracious guide for the evening is Safi (Ammar Haj Ahmad), fleeing the nightmare of Aleppo, and noting in a coda that he spoke more English in the thronging camp each day than he does now in Leicester where he awaits a decision about asylum.Okot, a 17-year -ld boy from Darfur, had to go through several kinds of hell to get to Calais to get here; his harrowing story is embodied with an astonishing intensity of pain by John Pfumojena. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An assortment of do-gooding Brits descend, eager to organise the troops. Michael Gould's Derek, with his clip-board and earnest chivvying manner, might seem straight out of Ayckbourn, but he has his depths. In his cups one night, he suggests that the paradox at the heart of the Jungle is that the refugees are running in one direction and the volunteers are running in another, But they are all running towards the same thing. &quot;We're building an image of Britain that doesn't exist! Certainly not in Britain. It exists in our dreams only.&quot; He thinks, though, that with time it could exist in this spot.Whereupon a refugee drily replies that it is never mad to believe you can create a fair society: &quot;But remember, Derek, no one wants to stay here. We all want to get to UK, Let's get you to bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The production invites the gentle laughter of rueful recognition at the volunteers and we come to respect their dedication and stamina. Alex Lawther brings some delicate touches to the potential caricature of Sam, the Eton posh-boy turned town planner. He cultivates a French official for mutual favours and is told that his city-building in the camp, with its designs on permanence, is inflicting the cruelty of false hope. And Rachel Redford's excellent gap-year Beth fumes at the empty virtue-signalling of the government, vociferous that people have human rights &quot;until they are standing at our door, screaming for help&quot;. She becomes determined to smuggle Okot into Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The production is beautifully orchestrated, deftly weaving individual storylines into the general hubbub of argument and song. It has too much humour to fall into the trap of preachiness. The play performs the vital role of raising awareness, swarming with details that bring home the felt experiences of refugees and making you ashamed that you ever thought of them as a generalised problem. The show breathes with the generosity of spirit that it champions. An admirable joint endeavour - wonderfully humane and illuminating.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than 480,000 people - roughly the population of Edinburgh - have fled for their lives into Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many have experienced horrific violence and the destruction of their homes and villages. They are traumatised, vulnerable and desperately need our help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charity bosses say the refugees are here chowdry living in extremely difficult conditions, with a massive and immediate increase in humanitarian assistance needed to save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also an urgent need to get food and items such as pots, pans, soap and jerry cans to thousands in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen Disasters Emergency Committee member charities have come together to call for funds to respond to the needs of those affected by what the United Nations describe as &quot;textbook ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are not recognised as citizens in the Buddhist-majority country of Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Rohingya insurgents attacked army posts in August, the state responded with terrifying force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have reported rape, infanticide, brutal beatings and people being burned alive. Satellite images show 200 villages have been burned to the ground. In this huge movement of terrified people, families have been split up. Zia estimates women and children make up 60 per cent of the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the camp, women are too scared to leave their makeshift shelters. Children walk around the sprawling camp, searching for their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zia said: &quot;Every day we see children wandering around endlessly. The community are trying to look after them but basically they've lost their folks, they can't find their mum and dad, they don't know if they're alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women stay at the back of the camp, they don't come out, they're traumatised and they're scared. They've lost their husband. They've been through horror to get to this place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a huge number of elderly people, lots of people with disabilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zia and his staff are picking their way through the mud, helping the refugees. The camp is enormous. Yesterday it took one medical worker two hours to walk from one end to another. He added: &quot;We are going shack to shack, tent to tent, plastic to plastic, to see just who's in there, talk to them and find out what their needs are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions have improved, slightly, since CARE and other aid agencies arrived. Zia said: &quot;Four weeks ago, we were on the roadside giving out umbrellas. Now we can go quite deep inside the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We started with cooked food. Now people have got a little tiny shelter and a little tiny stove we are giving them rice to cook for themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next stage in the relief effort is to improve the shacks and basic hygiene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zia added: &quot;We need proper shelters, with high-quality plastic and bamboo. And we need to get a more balanced diet, most people are just getting rice and they can't survive on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so many vulnerable people crammed into a tiny space, Zia fears an epidemic could break out at any time. He said: &quot;There are hardly any toilets at all - two or three for a thousand people. So people don't use them, they go outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children who were born here have not been vaccinated and we don't know how many were vaccinated in Myanmar. We're worried about the outbreak of disease so we are trying to vaccinate children fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his 20 years of humanitarian work, these are the worst scenes Zia has seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the sheer number of people in such a small space. At times you feel like you're in a football crowd, there are so many people crammed together round the aid distribution points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then you go into the camp and it's tent after tent after tent, you can't walk between them they're so tightly packed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This would stretch any country and Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very rarely movements of people on this scale. In 20 years of working with refugees I've never seen anything like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They escaped the genocide unleashed in Myanmar... only to arrive in a hell where the scale of the crisis is told in staggeringly high numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven more giant settlements lie close on the border of poverty-stricken Bangladesh, housing 700,000 Rohingya Muslims - including 250,000 children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are in the region of Cox's Bazar, where half a million refugees - more than the population of Liverpool - have arrived in the last month alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malnutrition is rife. With open sewers, disease threatens to sweep the camps, while monsoon rains hit aid agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear and famine abound in equal measures. Pain is visible all around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And tales of murder, torture, rape and assaults are heard everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young mum Sajede Begum, 25, saw two daughters die when troops and local militia torched her home in Nabura village, in the Mongdu district of Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engulfed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She tried in vain to save them, but could do nothing as the leaf-roofed structure was engulfed with flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just seven days later her husband Mohamed, 26, was shot with a single bullet when the same troops returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;My husband used to tell me that we must leave but we never did. Then he was shot dead by the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't say anything, they just came in and shot him. I didn't know if I was going to die. Now I worry about feeding my remaining children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With her two-month-old daughter in her arms, Sajede made a six-day trek to the border with her two other children, Rushmi, seven, and Safad, two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She reached the refugee camps after a perilous trip on a crowded fishing boat across the rain-swollen Naf River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers are performing miracles here but need more help and supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Mohammed Rifat, a GP from Dhaka, said his volunteer team treated nearly 1,000 people in a single day. He said: &quot;I'm shocked by the scale of the disease and injuries. Some people have leg and hand injuries consistent with bullet wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sabkun Hakan's starving daughter wolfs down food supplements after more than three weeks without a proper meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashika is just eight months old but has acute malnutrition. Her withered arms are no wider than a 2p coin. She is so weak she cannot cry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sabkun revealed she hid in the Myanmar jungle and neighbouring rice fields to avoid the violent and systematic rape inflicted on the Rohingya women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;I saw many women who were sexually attacked. It took us three days to cross the border. I'm not sure if my daughter will live or die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef experts fear 150,000 children are malnourished. Anuradha Narayan, Unicef's chief of nutrition for Bangladesh, said: &quot;The young children are listless, they look vacant, like they are surviving on their basic metabolism. The influx has been so huge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid this chaos and carnage, scores of newborns are adding to the numbers in the camps - 400 have already arrived. Tiny Kamal Hossain took his first breaths in the Uchiprang settlement 18 days ago - arriving the day mother completed a gruelling three-day trek. Hasina Begum, 30, was heavily pregnant when she fled Myanmar's Thurkhali district after local militia and government troops gunned down two villagers and told Rohingyas to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now she fears the sickness ravaging Kamal's body will claim his life. Hasina said: &quot;I'm not getting enough food so I cannot breastfeed. My child will not stop trembling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mass exodus from Myanmar began on August 25 after a military purge in the wake of attacks on police outposts. Twelve officers died and Rohingyas were blamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have fled say troops and Buddhists in Rakhine province are conducting a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An independent tribunal in Kuala Lumpar last week ruled Myanmar was guilty of genocide, confirming rape, murder and brutal attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar, which is predominantly Buddhist, denies it, but has postponed a visit by UN officials and diplomats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, does not control the military and has faced criticism for not condemning them. Experts predict that hundreds of thousands more refugees will head for the Bangladesh border. On Thursday, 60 died when a boat heading for the safety of the refugee camps capsized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days ago, Suu Kyi said the Rohingya could return. But few will feel safe - and their future, for now, lies in the refugee shanty towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef's Jean-Jacques Simon said: &quot;Imagine half a million people coming over the border. It's like an entire city being built from nothing in one of the poorest districts of Bangladesh.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">518 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of editorial entitled Tragedy facing the returnees and their political exploitation by the presidential palace by independent Maseer newspaper on 31 July</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees who have returned to Afghanistan from Pakistan are facing many hardships. Despite repeated government promises of assistance to them, they have received nothing. The biggest challenge facing the returnees is lack of shelter. They have no access to education and health services also. Their lands have been grabbed by powerful actors and they cannot find jobs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their representatives have met everyone from the president to the minister for refugees and returnees only to receive empty promises. Even worse, authorities take political advantage of returnees. They do not solve their problems or give them their rights. [For example,] The president tried to engage in political rhetoric until the end of his meeting with representatives of the returnees at the presidential palace yesterday. Although the problems and needs of the returnees were discussed and promises to resolve them made, nothing was said about how these needs will be met and problems solved. Even worse, the statement issued by the presidential palace states before even touching on returnees' problems that returnees have pledged their support for the president's policies. The statement reads: Representing two and a half million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, they [returnees' representatives] declared their support for the President's plans especially on administrative reform and anti-corruption. Somebody may indeed have spoken of support for the president, but the palace's reflection of this issue in this fashion suggests that it does not care about the hardships returnees are facing and that, on the contrary, it is trying to take political advantage of refugees and returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are authorities not paying attention to the quality of life of the returnees? Women, children and elderly returnees live in extreme cold in winter and in extreme heat in summer. Instead of providing them with shelter and education and health services and employment opportunities, authorities continue to focus on how to exploit them for political gain. Can authorities say what they have done for the returnees especially returnees from Pakistan? Returnees from Pakistan have only received 200 to 400 US dollars from UNHCR as resettlement assistance. Nothing else has been done for them. The government has even not been able to return to them their lands grabbed by local strongmen. The government claims continuously that it is allotting plots to returnees, but few returnees have been given plots, that too in areas where they cannot use them at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, returnees are in a difficult situation. Some are even threatened with being labelled as agents of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) for having lived in and returned from Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government should do more for the returnees. It should meet their basic needs and stop taking advantage of them for political gain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Syrian family fear they will be torn apart after the Home Office said their young son must be deported from the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mirzo family were reunited with their son Mohammed in April after more than four years apart, but the Home Office say he must return to Bulgaria where he first arrived in the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His family say he was badly mistreated in Bulgaria, a country that has been strongly criticised for its treatment of refugees and migrants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Mirzo, 19, is currently being held in an immigration detention centre in Oxfordshire and could be deported at any moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A keen footballer, Mohammed was separated from the rest of his family when he was aged 16 and ended up in Bulgaria after they fled from Aleppo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cardiff Bus fares are increasing and it's being blamed on congestion and running costs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then made it toCardiffwhere he was saw his mum for the first time in two years and met his newborn baby brother for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali Mirzo, Mohammed's father, said: &quot;Mohammed's mother and I are desperately worried about our son. We visited him in the detention centre this week and his medical situation is already getting worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His greatest fear is being removed to Bulgaria, where he had a such traumatic experience when he was still just a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His life was turned upside-down when he became a refugee at the age of 16 and he lived through suffering in Bulgaria and Germany that no child should experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only will he be alone and vulnerable in Bulgaria, but he has threatened to harm himself in the past, and we are concerned that his current situation will lead him to do this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five people describe what the Welsh language means to them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After around five months in Bulgaria, Mohammed travelled to Germany, where his family say he was attacked by a neo-Nazi gang suffering a broken shoulder which has still not fully healed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mohammed made it to Cardiff he applied for refugee status, but during one Home Office meeting he was detained and held at Parc Prison for two days before being sent to the Campsfield Immigration Removal Centre in Oxfordshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His family say he could be deported to Bulgaria before November 2, prompting a petition which has gained almost 6,000 signatures in three days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to human rights charity Amnesty, in 2016/17 Bulgaria failed to provide &quot;all required services&quot; and &quot;access to proper procedures&quot; for the growing number of migrants and refugees in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's an organised mini trail in search of Cardiff Bay's Snowdogs this weekend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed's brother Salah, 21, said: &quot;Almost every hour we have to call him to give him hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he is sent to Bulgaria I don't think anything good will happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation will be very bad, and it's like they took a piece of my mother's heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed's father Ali, a teacher by profession, arrived in Cardiff in 2015 and gradually brought the rest of his family to join him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Settling in Lakeside, Ali set up the Royal Coast Cafe in the city centre and volunteers as an interpreter for child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything we know about plans to redevelop Newport's troubled Ringland area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali said: &quot;We are so grateful for the welcome that Cardiff has offered to my family and to other Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only are we safe here, but I have been able to set up a business and make a future for our family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have also been able to make a contribution to society, as a taxpayer, an employer, and a volunteer with community groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been given the kind of warm Welsh welcome that we will never forget, but that only makes us fear the situation my son will face in Bulgaria if he is deported there even more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali's two teenage daughters have settled at Cardiff High andLlanishenHigh schools and he and his wife have a young baby boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family said they are appealing the Home Office decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of helping homeless people in Wales</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;The UK has a proud history of providing protection to those who need it, but it is only fair that we do not shoulder the burden of asylum claims that should rightly be considered by other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Asylum seekers should claim in the first safe country they arrive in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where there is evidence that an asylum seeker is the responsibility of another European country we will seek to return them there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of Australia's most senior clinicians has offered to conduct free health assessments of the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island to ensure they are not being deprived their human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an open letter signed by 18 current and former heads of peak medical bodies and royal colleges of medicine, the clinicians said they were &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about the ongoing physical and mental health of the men who were removed from the decommissioned detention centre last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also expressed concern over the damage being done to Australia's reputation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island: MSF denied access to refugees as thousands rally in Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that the humanitarian issues take precedence over politics,&quot; the letter said. &quot;This is a matter beyond immigration and border control but one that affects the health of people and others' perceptions of our great nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior clinicians, who said they wrote in their individual capacities, said the reported poor hygiene and sanitation, limited electricity and inadequate living conditions would all exacerbate disease and ill health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said they were not aware of any accurate information on the health of the former detainees and offered to assist in an &quot;immediate, independent review&quot; of those still on Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are willing to conduct this review pro-bono, arranging the appropriate mix of clinical specialties,&quot; they said. &quot;We would require the Australian government to negotiate the diplomatic permissions and officially sanction travel to and within PNG, as well as agree to clinical assessment of willing individuals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A standoff lasting more than three weeks came to an end on Thursday and Friday after Papua New Guinea police and immigration officials forcibly removed all remaining men who had refused to leave over concerns for their safety in the Lorengau community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers used metal batons against the men to get them on to busses. Many have since reported injuries and alleged further beatings, including the Kurdish Iranian refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani, who was targeted for arrest on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's letter said the men had a universal right to health and wellbeing enshrined in the UN charter, which should not be affected by their political and citizenship status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All politicians regardless of their political party should respect the human right to health and themselves be strong advocates of 'health for all' without discrimination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signatories included four past presidents of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, and the current and immediate past president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, as well as a former head of the Australian Medical Association, and mental health expert Prof Patrick McGorry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGorry, who is president of the Schizophrenia International Research Society and the International Association for Youth Mental Health, is also a former Australian of the year who signed another open letter on the refugee issue last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  New centre at Manus still a construction site, says Tim Costello</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That letter, from 12 former Australians of the year, condemned the crisis on Manus and called for the Australian Medical Association to be allowed access to assess and treat the refugees and asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The AMA has made many representations on this matter, both publicly and in private but, with a worsening and more dangerous situation emerging on Manus, the federal council strongly believes that urgent action and answers are needed,&quot; the AMA president, Michael Gannon, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, suggested the prominent Australians should write a thank you letter to Australian Border Force and the navy instead for stopping deaths at sea when people sought asylum by boat in large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism continues to mount over the Manus Island situation but the Australian government has remained steadfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res revealed it was also being denied access to the men. MSF had arrived on Manus on Wednesday with approval from the PNG immigration department but were denied entry to the centre. After the men were removed and taken to the transit centre MSF was still denied access to the accommodation and the medical clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of MSF Australia, Stewart Condon, told Guardian Australia they were particularly concerned about the health of men with psychiatric conditions and whose supply of medication likely ran out more than 10 days ago, based on earlier reports they were given extra doses to see through the transition of the centre's closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the UNHCR said the humanitarian crisis was human-made and entirely preventable, and a &quot;damning indictment of a policy meant to avoid Australia's international obligations&quot;. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of brutal fighting, the battle to retake Raqqa, the self-declared capital of the Islamic State caliphate, is almost over. Scroll down to follow photographer Achilleas Zavallis and reporter Martin Chulov as they journey from the Iraqi border to the wasteland of the frontline of the ancient Syrian city where the few remaining Isis fighters are making their last stand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Crossing the Syrian border                   </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bobbing rhythmically over barren hills, the donkey heads of Rojava's oil trade draw crude from the ground, sending it down thin pipes to a refinery nearby. These basic black pumps are the linchpin of the region's economy, and are central to what happens after Isis is finally pushed from Raqqa and its surrounds. Oil could galvanise Kurdish claims on autonomy. The subterranean riches here are also tempting for forces fighting to the south, Russian, Iranian, American and Syrian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Driving between Kobani and Ain Issa                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria's newest refugees arrive most days here, on a dusty outpost near a teeming refugee camp. They tumble exhausted from clapped out lorries and cars that have barely made the journey. Their faces swathed in scarves to avoid the dust and flies, they settle into makeshift tents, and wait. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many come from Raqqa. Others from towns and villages close to Deir ez-Zor, where Isis is fighting yet another last stand. Their fate, like that of the millions of others who have fled five years of war and insurgency, is uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Visiting the Ain Issa IDP camp                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees from Syria and Iraq are crammed into this camp, one of the biggest in the Raqqa hinterland. Some had been displaced more than three times before arriving here. &quot;Everywhere we go, the airstrikes follow,&quot; said Abu Jassem, originally from Falluja in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one corner are the widows and orphans of foreign fighters. Blond and red-headed children frolic in a small courtyard. Their mothers hide behind curtains, many wearing chadors. They are stigmatised by their captors and by other refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   East Raqqa YPG base                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this half-finished concrete building, fighters in the war with Isis rest and recuperate, before heading to the frontline a mile away. Their dead and wounded are brought here. They sleep, eat and plan the war in the room upstairs, from where they can see smoke rising from the battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, Hazam, a Kurd from Kobani, who lost a hand in the battle for his home town, oversees a fighting force of mostly Arab youths from Raqqa. Hazam is supervised by a Kurd from the Turkish mountains. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Fighting nearby                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters help a shellshocked comrade to his feet. The fighter and his team were hit by an RPG round, fired by Isis militants, while trying to assist cut-off members of their unit on the east Raqqa front line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Approaching the frontline                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than half a mile from the Raqqa clock tower, anti-Isis fighters are dug into the ruins of several buildings. Some use holes in a wall to scope for extremists further on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their foes, like them, move through holes they have smashed through walls. The enemy is often less than two buildings away, hidden in the remnants of a ruined city that was once the heart of their so-called caliphate, but volunteers fighting with the Kurds say they have never seen a live Isis member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burnt-out cars are used as a temporary road blockade near a SDF base as a precautionary measure against Isis suicide car bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Near Clock Tower Square                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the jagged wasteland there is a prize that all those fighting Isis are aiming for: a clock tower that stands on a small roundabout. Public executions were routinely performed there, and some of the group's most infamous members lived nearby. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holborn Assets, a leading financial services organisation, has joined forces with Emirates Red Crescent in an effort to provide a wide range of school supplies for Syrian and Yemeni refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Logo:http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/555109/Holborn_Assets_Limited_Logo.jpg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Photo:http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/555105/Holborn_Assets_celebrate_fundraising_success.jpg)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the first week of September, Holborn Assets has been sourcing and funding hundreds of notepads, pens, pencils, art kits, calculators, school bags and more to provide children in Dubai, and those currently living within refugee settlements, with a range of academic equipment. Holborn Assets has joined the initiative started by Dubai-based Venkatraman Krishnamoorthy, of Tamil Nadu, India, who collected a record-breaking 10,000+ kg of stationery for refugee children around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holborn was given the green light to support the cause by the Islamic Affairs &amp; Charitable Activities Department. In addition to the Emirates Red Crescent, the school-supply drive is supported by Education4All, Dubai Chamber's Engage Dubai, IBPDubai and UAE Schools and Well-Wishers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the upcoming weeks, employees at Holborn will be further boosting this effort by taking part in various sports events as they look to secure sponsorship and raise funds for the Emirates Red Crescent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the activities, CEO of Holborn Assets, Bob Parker, said: &quot;As announced by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, 2017 is the UAE's Year of Giving and our team is very excited to be involved in supporting such a worthy and timely cause. Holborn Assets is committed to expanding its community work in addition to raising awareness about the Red Crescent's wider goals - we also encouraged our clients and the public to drop off any school supplies directly to our office!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Further to education essentials, a number of our financial advisors will soon be putting their sporting abilities to the test in efforts to raise cash donations for Red Crescent's extensive educational and humanitarian efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the upcoming months, Holborn Assets will be championing a range of voluntary activities for these great causes in what promises to be a record-breaking year of charitable donations from the business as we look to support causes in the UAE and across the world and shall be sharing more news here very shortly!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This collection was undertaken under the umbrella of Emirates Red Crescent - license No 581 of Islamic Affairs &amp; Charitable Activities Department.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, faces crucial talks on forming a new government on Sunday following last month's damaging election losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration is set to dominate the agenda as Mrs Merkel meets with Horst Seehofer, the leader of her Bavarian sister party and an implacable opponent of her refugee policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel is trying to put together a new coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Green Party. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel on Saturday made her most explicit backing yet for the so-called &quot;Jamaica&quot; coalition, because the colours of the three parties match the black, yellow and green of the Caribbean country's flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said in Dresden: &quot;I advise everyone to concentrate on what lies ahead. First between the CDU and (Bavarian) Christian Social Union (CSU) then with the Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens and to understand the mandate that voters handed us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before she can begin negotiations, however, she has to put her own house in order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Seehofer is threatening to pull his Christian Social Union party (CSU) out of any coalition unless Mrs Merkel agrees to an annual limit on the number of refugees allowed into Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with both the FDP and the Greens opposed to any limit, it is a demand Mrs Merkel can ill afford to give in to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   German election results                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Complicating matters still futher for the chancellor, she needs the CSU's 46 MPs for a coalition to command a majority in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSU has been in an almost continuous alliance with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) since 1949, and its participation in any CDU-led coalition is usually automatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Seehofer said this week discussions with the CDU following the election have been &quot;the most difficult since 1976&quot;, when the two parties briefly split for a few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSU suffered damaging losses in last month's elections, and Mr Seehofer's position as party leader is hanging by a thread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has made no secret of the fact he blames Mrs Merkel's &quot;open-door&quot; refugee policy for the losses . &quot;The election was not lost in Bavaria, but in Berlin,&quot; he was reported to have said recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German Chancellor Angela Merkel&nbsp;Credit:      AP     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Seehofer opposed Mrs Merkel's refugee policy from the start and his party has long demanded an annual limit of 200,000 refugees a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not budge on the upper limit,&quot; Manfred Weber, a senior MEP said this week, while Alexander Dobrindt, the outgoing transport minister, described it as &quot;non-negotiable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if Mrs Merkel were prepared to back down over the issue, her putative coalition partners in the FDP and the Green party are just as adamant they will not agree to an upper limit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talks could also cause Mrs Merkel a few headaches over European Union reform.&nbsp; The CSU opposes any German funding for French leader Emmanuel Macron's proposed new joint Eurozone budget, while Mrs Merkel is keen to offer Mr Macron some support over reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Seehofer is facing calls to resign as CSU leader over the election losses, and will not want to return to Munich empty-handed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But equally pulling the CSU out of coalition would almost certainly lead to new elections - which could lead to further losses for the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel will not want to force Mr Seehofer into a corner - not least because his likely successor as CSU leader, Markus S&ouml;der, is considerably more hardline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, most analysts agree she will try to find a compromise formula that will allow Mr Seehofer to claim victory in the talks, while still keeping herself a free hand in the negotiations with the FDP and Greens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One possibility that is being talked about is the CDU agreeing to a &quot;guideline&quot; upper limit that would not be binding on the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will surely find a wording of penetrating beauty and Horst Seehofer will say it's the upper limit,&quot; Wolfgang Bosbach, a senior CDU politician said this week.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya refugee debate is far from over in India as the government continued to make a strong pitch for their deportation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India Today TV has exclusively accessed a copy of the affidavit that the government was all set to file in the Supreme Court where it argues that the refugees are a security&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is thought to have held back the document for tweaks at the last moment. The ministry of home Affairs will ask the SC not to interfere with the deportation process, saying they are illegal immigrants and hence can't stay in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has made a security pitch as well as a right to resources plea to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government fears that the north-eastern corridor that has already seen many insurgencies, including ULFA in Assam and Naga uprising in Nagaland as well as a volatile Manipur, could be further exploited by elements from the Rohingya Muslim community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affidavit adds, 'There is also a serious potential and possibility of eruption of violence against Myanmar government/its diplomatic missions and also against Buddhists who are Indian citizen who stay on Indian soil by the radicalised Rohingya.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled from Myanmar following a military crackdown, which the UN has described as 'ethnic cleansing'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many taking refuge in Bangladesh and some then crossing a porous border into India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar says its forces are carrying out their legitimate duty to restore order after guerrilla attacks last month on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, the Narendra Modi government has connected militancy with sections of Rohingyas living in India.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Some of the Rohingya with militant backgrounds are also found to be very active in Jammu, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mewat, and have been identified as having a very serious and potential threat to the internal/national security of India,' &nbsp;said the affidavit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior official -on condition of anonymity - &nbsp;said they have particular objection to Jammu as the radicalised elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mewat, not far from Delhi, has in the past seen communal tensions which authorities believe can be exploited by these elements with the Rohingya Muslims living in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hyderabad has been a hotbed of ISIS sympathisers with many being arrested and questioned for days as they embarked to go to Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agencies fear the growing presence of Rohingya Muslims in the southern city is a ticking time bomb that is impossible to monitor 24/7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of State for Home, Kiren Rijiju said this month that the Rohingya living in India have to be 'pushed back'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Jitendra Singh, who handles the Ministry Of Personnel, told India Today TV that their deportation is natural and there is nothing wrong in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party also feel that a tough stand on the issue will send a positive message to the party's core constituency that will help it in upcoming assembly elections in key states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security is not the only pitch the government is making.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Providing facilities/privileges to illegal immigrants out of the existing national resources , apart from above referred direct threat to national security, would also have a direct adverse impact upon Indian citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It would deprive the Indian citizen of the legitimate share in the employment sector, subsidized housing, medical and educational facilities.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research by Cornell University has led to the dire prediction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research by Cornell University has led to the dire prediction, which could see two billion people displaced by 2100.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who live on coastline or islands are most at risk from the rising sea levels, which threaten to swallow vast swathes of land.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lead author Charles Geisler, professor emeritus of development sociology at Cornell, said the people will effectively become refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;We're going to have more people on less land and sooner that we think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The future rise in global mean sea level probably won't be gradual.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet few policy makers are taking stock of the significant barriers to entry that coastal climate refugees, like other refugees, will encounter when they migrate to higher ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A United Nations report projects the world's population will skyrocket to nine billion in 2050, and to 11 billion by 2100.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Geisler estimates 1.4 billion people will have lost their homes by 2060</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will further impact humanity as the encroaching sea overtakes fertile coastal zones and river deltas, forcing people to look for arable land elsewhere.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the problem swells, Mr Geisler estimates 1.4 billion people will have lost their homes by 2060, rising to two billion by the end of the century.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The colliding forces of human fertility, submerging coastal zones, residential retreat, and impediments to inland resettlement is a huge problem.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We offer preliminary estimates of the lands unlikely to support new waves of climate refugees due to the residues of war, exhausted natural resources, declining net primary productivity, desertification, urban sprawl, land concentration, 'paving the planet' with roads and greenhouse gas storage zones offsetting permafrost melt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some steps are already being taken to address the looming problem, particularly in China and Florida.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sunshine state has the second-longest coastline in the US, and officials have devised the Comprehensive Planning Act to account for a massive loss of coastal area.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State planners have come up with solutions including alternating and coordinating coastal and inland use in anticipation of population shifts due to the weather.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outlining the worst-case scenario which faces the planet, Mr Geisler said: &quot;Beyond sea level rise, low-elevation coastal zones in many countries face intensifying storm surges that will push sea water further inland.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historically, humans have spent considerable effort reclaiming land from oceans, but now live with the opposite - the oceans reclaiming terrestrial spaces on the planet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who live on coastline or islands are most at risk </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pressure is on us to contain greenhouse gas emissions at present levels.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the best 'future proofing' against climate change, sea level rise and the catastrophic consequences likely to play out on coasts, as well as inland in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a beaming Pope Francis swapped the Popemobile for a brightly painted rickshaw towards the end of his six-day trip to Burma and Bangladesh, Rohingya refugees just an hour's flight away in Kutupalong camp were struggling to understand why he could not also board a helicopter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope came all the way from Rome - he should have come here,&quot; said Mohammad Hussein, 18, gesturing at what is fast turning into the world's largest refugee camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussein escaped from Burma with his mother and three siblings after their village was attacked and his father's throat slit. Now they live in a hut of plastics sheets, cardboard and bamboo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope is a big leader who everyone listens to,&quot; he said. &quot;The Burmese government is killing our people, raping our women and stopping our children going to school. If he had come face to face with us here he would have seen our suffering and how we have been oppressed and tortured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kefayet Ullah, another refugee, complained: &quot;The Pope always used to address Muslims as brothers, but now it seems we don't matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said that because the papal trip was organised before the Rohingya crisis started, the Bangladeshi authorities could not facilitate the complicated logistical and security challenges of visiting Kutupalong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet from the young man having a &quot;Neymar&quot; cut in a makeshift barber's shop to the grandfather trying to weigh live chickens on a scale and the mullah calling to prayers in a hilltop mosque, everyone in the camp seemed to know about the Pope's visit to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he is an outspoken advocate for refugees, the plight of the Rohingya cast a long shadow over his trip. There was disappointment in the camp when he did not even use the word Rohingya in Burma on the first leg of the trip, despite global condemnation of what the UN has called &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vatican advisers, apparently fearful of reprisals against Burma's small Catholic minority, for whom the trip was originally planned, claimed it was more important to build bridges with the Burmese government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending his approach last night, the Pope said: &quot;It's true I didn't have the pleasure of slamming the door in their face publicly with a denunciation, but I had the satisfaction of dialogue, and letting the other side dialogue, and in this way the message arrived.&quot; He insisted that his true feelings were made clear in private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism abated when, after a multi-faith meeting in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, on Friday, the pontiff met 16 Rohingya. &quot;We won't close our hearts. We won't look away,&quot; he assured them in a trembling voice, visibly moved as he held their hands and listened to their stories. After touching the head of a young girl whose entire family was killed, he added: &quot;The presence of God today is also called Rohingya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the camp, however, this was not enough for Sanjida, 25, who took 11 days to escape from Burma by foot and boat with her four children and grandmother after her husband was killed. &quot;Everyone here is talking about Pope Francis and we are happy he is taking our side but we can't understand why he can't come here and see how we are living,&quot; she said. &quot;We thought the Pope was here for us so it was very disappointing that he did not come and see us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pope spent some of his final hours in Dhaka yesterday visiting a home for the destitute founded by Mother Teresa. And as darkness fell last night in Kutupalong, some Rohingya came out to see the almost full moon, saying it made them happy even in the midst of such hardship. Yet still there was regret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammad Kashim, 24, who arrived two months ago, said: &quot;We're so frustrated the Pope left without visiting the camp. If his visit to both countries was to try to help solve the problem and make peace, then he should have come to see what miserable conditions we're in.&quot;&nbsp;@christinalambHOW YOU CAN GIVETO THE SUNDAY TIMES CHRISTMAS APPEALOnline: go to savethechildren.org.uk/sundaytimesCall 0800 055 7676Text APPEAL TO 70008 to give &pound;5*You'll be billed &pound;5 plus standard rate text message.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the height of the migrant crisis Ankara took on 3.4 million refugees headed for Europe at the behest of Brussels in return for aid cash, visa authorisation and the promise of membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim went on to claim the EU's side of the bargain was &quot;a big big lie&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on to tell &nbsp;express.co.uk that despite the &quot;regret&quot; that comes with joining the Brussels bloc, his country would still push ahead with plans to become a full member state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Yildirim said: &quot;We are currently welcoming 3.5million refugees in Turkey - what happens if we were to tell them 'ok, here's Europe, off we go?', Can you imagine what can happen?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But of course&nbsp;its&nbsp;not a behaviour we will display it is not befitting of us, it is not in compliance with how seriously we see this issue to use these people as a potential threat to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had the agreement of the 18th&nbsp;March,&nbsp;2016 with the EU. We were supposedly going to deal with all of these issues, the Visa authorisation would come, assistance would flow from the EU and the EU would take some refugees, that was what it was about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it turns out that was a big, big lie and we left that negotiating table and after that Turkey was left to its own devices to figure out these matters for itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between Turkey and the EU have remained fractious since President Erdogan saw off a failed coup to oust him from power last year by pushing ahead with increasingly autocratic rule across his nation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey and the EU have struggled with a fractious relationship in recent years</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite decrying the &quot;regret&quot; that comes with joining the EU, the Mr Yildirim said Turkey will still push ahead with their plan to join the 27-nation superstate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to Express.co.uk, he said: &quot;If you become a member of the EU that's a source of regret for you and if you leave the EU you also end up regretting that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the UK, a member state is now exiting and we are trying to enter, I think we have a lot to exchange between the two of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Independent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 unaccompanied minors known to have crossed from northern France via unauthorised routes since last August remain unaccounted for by British authorities. Of 167 children referred to UK agencies as potential victims of human trafficking after making the crossing, 104 are missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The true figure is estimated to be far higher -possibly in the hundreds - with many unaccompanied minors said to be &quot;hidden&quot; from child protection agencies in both France and the UK, often ordered by traffickers not to engage with authorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities and campaigners have warned that missing youngsters are at risk of sexual and labour exploitation by trafficking and smuggling gangs, with adults ordering them to fulfil demands in order to pay the sum for their facilitated crossing, thought to be in the region of &pound;9,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as theScottish and Welsh governments accused the UK immigration minister of a &quot;lack of planning&quot; in theresettlement of unaccompanied minors through the Dubs scheme, saying &quot;more need to be included&quot; to avoid children being left without &quot;safe and legal options&quot; and at greater risk of being trafficked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heard of one case in which a boy was referred to UK agencies following his unauthorised arrival from Calais, and found to be living with his &quot;uncle&quot;.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another child told a charity in Calais that an adult man had told him if he does some &quot;work&quot; he would be &quot;taken to the UK&quot;. In another case, an 11-year-old boy who is now documented in the UK was discovered to be addicted to heroin after having been &quot;looked after&quot; by a group of men during his time in northern France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures were provided to </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the Refugee Youth Service (RYS), a Calais-based charity that keeps records of children known to have reached the UK and refers them to the NSPCC's Child Trafficking Advice Centre (CTAC), providing it with information such as names, photographsand dates of birth to help locate them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any unaccompanied child who arrives in the UK should under law be referred byimmigration or border staff to the local authority who is responsible for theirwelfare, but minors from Calaisincreasingly appear to be falling through the net and bypassing the protection systems in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael McHugh, the RYS coordination and child protection officer, warned that smugglers and traffickers operating across Calais and the UK were exploiting the closure of legal routes to Britain by facilitating alternative illegal crossings on lorries, with the exploitation continuing oncechildren reach British shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the Dubs scheme has closed down and family reunification referrals are extremely delayed, these kids' only real option is to jump on lorries,&quot; he said.&quot;There are people here now who are doing business facilitating this, and they speak the children's language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Young people are becoming more and more emboldened in their pursuit to cross, with many considering 'work' as a way to do it. One child here recently told me he was told by an adult male that if he could do some work he would be taken to the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McHugh added that the true number of unaccounted for minorsis probably far higher than 104, with many children ordered by traffickers and smugglers to avoid speaking to volunteers and authorities in order to avoid state interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the tip of the iceberg,&quot; he said.&quot;We can only do so much. There are children here who are trying not to be seen, manipulated by people who don't want them to be seen by us, worried about the state interfering. The true numbers will be far higher.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child refugees being wrongly identified as adults in Greece</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Government announced in early February that it was to close the Dubs scheme - intended to grant 3,000 vulnerable unaccompanied minors a safe passage to Britain - after accepting just 350, as well as ending an accelerated scheme to assess direct family ties through the Dublin regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, the then-immigration minister Robert Goodwilladmitted that an &quot;administrative error&quot; had led to 130 places for child refugees offered by UK local councils not being taken into consideration as part of the Dubs scheme, but no additional children are known to have been brought to the UK to fill these places as of yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Trafficking and Modern Slaverypublished last week found no evidence that providing a safe route for children to travel to the UK acted as a &quot;pull factor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings found that the decision by the Government and others to create a &quot;hostile environment&quot; has led to young people in northern France, many of whom have relatives living in Britain, being forced into the hands of criminal gangs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christine Beddoe, an adviser on tackling child trafficking who co-authored the report, said children and young people in Calais are turning to smugglers &quot;in desperation&quot; to help them get out of their current situation, which she said&quot;can very quickly turn into a trafficking situation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both in Calais and once they reach the UK, children and young peopleare falling victim to sexual exploitation, labour exploitation, criminal exploitation - it can be all three,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very high prices are demanded and if they don't have families who can pay, then those young people are expected to do something to pay back that money, and then that turns into an exploitation situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can either pay your way if you've got money, or if you haven't got money, the very same opportunistic criminals will stilltry to get you there. But then these children arelocked into having to repay that debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Beddoe highlighted that one of the most concerning yet underreported forms of exploitation regarding children brought from Calais to the UK is the sexual exploitation of young boys, which she pointed out was &quot;not even mentioned&quot; in the vulnerability criteria of the Dubs scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the biggest problems that is hidden in the UK with victims of trafficking is the sexual exploitation of young boys,&quot; she said.&quot;Because in a lot of the countries they come from there is so much stigma about sexual abuse of males, victims are veryreluctant to talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But rampant sexual abuse that goes on, not only on the journey, but also here in the UK. This level of abuse is so hidden here that when the British Government under the Dubs scheme talked about the vulnerability criteria, they didn't even mention about sexual abuse of male children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hidden on a policy level. The whole political framework overlooks the vulnerability of boys from all sorts of different backgrounds being sexually abused, and that is one of the crises in this situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swati Pande, assistant team manager of CTAC, which is central to identifying the missing children,said: &quot;Many of these children, through no choice of their own, will have been forced to leave dangerous situations and now find themselves in a strange country without any support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are vulnerable to being trafficked or moved for physical labour or sexual sexually exploitation and may not know how to seek help. Once a child is hidden from authorities and safe adults, it is extremely difficult to trace them and get access to the right support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Getty)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are to protect children then organisations must act swiftly when they spot the warning signs and adults who are worried about a child contact the right authorities. We're helping professionals to spot the signs to prevent children being abused through child trafficking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once unaccompanied minors are reported to CTAC by the RYS after reaching the UK, they are immediately referred to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) - the official framework for identifying victims of human trafficking. Earlier this year, the the number of child trafficking victim referrals to the NRM rose by 30 per cent, markinga record high.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a third of all potential victims of trafficking were children aged 18 and under, with a majority of children drawn into exploitative labour, including forced criminality and sexual exploitation. Children from Afghanistan and Eritrea - two of the most common nationalities of minors in northern France - were among the top four most likely to be referred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KevinHyland, the UK's Anti-Slavery Commissioner, said not enough was being done to prevent children from being exploited as they pursue &quot;dangerous&quot; migration routes, and urged that without international action the child trafficking dangers willonly increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Unaccompanied children are especially vulnerable to human trafficking and modern slavery, and protecting these young people is one of my top priorities. Children who are seeking sanctuary need safety, not slave-like conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Often, children will not wait for authorities to support them. Opportunistic criminals target young people who lack the security of parents or guardians, leaving them at risk of exploitation even before they arrive in the UK. This risk will continue to be heightened unless we improve protection's internationally and address issues in source countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many children are exploited, and there have even been lives lost, as a result of entering into dangerous migration routes. For too long criminals have operated along these routes with impunity. The global community must do more by enforcing laws, disrupting criminal networks and identifying victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to stop playing the blame game. It's time to move from a culture of condemnation to one of responsibility. We have UN global goals - now is the time to put them into action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beth Gardiner-Smith, senior campaigns organiser for Safe Passage, a charity assisting unaccompanied minors eligible to come to the UK, said: &quot;Currently it takes months for children in Calais to be reunited safely with family here in Britain, and only after the intervention of projects like Safe Passage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When children are sleeping rough, often surrounded by smugglers, this is simply too long to be waiting. Britain and France need to urgently agree a process to give all unaccompanied children immediate access to safe accommodation and fast family reunion if eligible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said in response to the figures: &quot;It is vital that children in care are protected from harm. That's why we have already strengthened regulations on children's homes and placed a duty on local authorities to tell us about all incidents of young people going missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, we know trafficked and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children can be particularly vulnerable. Our focus will continue to be on transferring all eligible minors to the UK as soon as possible and ensuring they arrive safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our strategy is clear - we believe the most vulnerable children are in the conflict zone around Syria and best way to help them is by resettling refugees directly from the region. This is how we can stop traffickers and smugglers from exploiting vulnerable people and children.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fishing boat drifts somewhere between England and France. There are children hiding on deck. Stowaways? Refugees, perhaps? The boat is set on fire, by someone wearing a gas mask; it's not clear if the kids are still on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man is found when the charred vessel is towed into Ramsgate, he's in the hold, alive, bound and gagged. But when the gag is removed by DCI Karl Roebuck (Stephen Dillane), he's still not saying much, because his tongue's been cut off. Ew.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turns out he wasn't much of a talker even when he had the equipment for it, especially not to the police. He's a trafficker, those children were refugees, wherever they are now. No bodies then, at the start of The Tunnel: Vengeance (Sky Atlantic), but missing kids, as well as the missing tongue. Actually, it's there, spat out in the hold, just no longer attached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's not the end of the horror. Rats run down the Channel tunnel. Not proverbial ones, escaping the sinking ship that is Brexit Britain, but actual ones, bloody great rodents, released into the tunnel deliberately. They knock over a French maintenance worker and have a gnaw on her face before being exterminated by pest control. It is, as Roebuck says, like a&nbsp; James Herbert novel. Or, combined with the missing children, like the Pied Piper, as Elise Wasserman (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy) finds while investigating on the internet. The Pied Piper of Calais?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elise is no longer commander, she has demoted herself, plus she has got toothache. And, although she's on the case with Karl again, Anglo-French relations have cooled, which may or may not have something to do with Brexit. His intent is at least cordial, but she's giving him the old &eacute;paule froide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their relationship and chemistry, and the performances of Dillane and Po&eacute;sy, are a big part of the success of The Tunnel and why it has successfully divorced itself from its Scandi parent, The Bridge, to become something in its own right. Karl, incidentally, has voted out of his marriage, although it seems to have been a relatively successful break with good deals on access to trade and children etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We won't get to see how actual Brexit impacts on The Tunnel as this third season will be the final one. They probably did an impact assessment and decided that future international cooperation, with regard to both policing and making television, was simply too uncertain. And over on this side, all the Kent filming locations might be chock-full of lorries waiting to get through customs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elise already doesn't have a high opinion of commercial fishermen from this side of la Manche. Is that true, what she says to Karl about female skate, the anatomy of their genitals and what British fisherman like to do with them? I started doing some serious journalistic research (Googling) on the subject, got as far as typing &quot;skate + vaginas&quot; and then thought: &quot;NO! I do not want to be doing this, especially not at work.&quot; Does Google remember if you just put the words in without hitting search? I'm hoping this paragraph might help me, come the tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quickly, back to the children then, the three from the boat. They are refugees, from Syria, and they are alive and well, thank God. They turn up, one morning, in the beds of three middle-class English children in their beautiful Kent Channel-view home. Much to the dismay of the middle-class English mum, not so much because she has suddenly got three refugee children in the house (what do Syrians have for breakfast anyway?), but because her own three children have disappeared!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, it's a bit bizarre, the sleepover kid-swap. Intriguing though, and it does mean that this series of The Tunnel is engaging with the Story in Europe right now: the refugee crisis. Specifically, the thousands of missing refugee children. And how the lives of some children are valued higher than others', depending on status, nationality, passport (or lack of), wealth, race. The police, who really weren't that interested when it was three Syrian kids missing, are all over it now that it's the Carver children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're alive, too, but drugged, apparently, being trundled somewhere in a trolley. Aleppo? For symmetry? To be honest, I doubt whoever is behind this is motivated by some kind of fortune redistribution. How does it end in the Pied Piper? Not well, Karl thinks. Depends which version I think. I would look, but I'm scared of the internet.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Cohen</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">537 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 26, 2017 the Supreme Court ruled that a limited version of the 90-day Travel Ban contained in President Trump's Executive Order 13780 could go into effect. The limited Travel Ban went into effect on June 29, 2017. Persons from one of the six designated countries (Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen) who cannot establish a pre-existing bona fide relationship to a close U.S. family member or U.S. employer, educational institution or other entity (or who cannot show that they are exempt from the ban or secure a waiver of the ban), are prohibited from entering the United States until the Travel Ban expires on September 27, 2017. In its ruling, the Supreme Court mentioned some relationships that would qualify but the Court did not provide a complete list of acceptable close family or entity relationships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the Supreme Court decision, U.S. government agencies, including the Department of State (DOS), issued guidance about which &quot;close&quot; family relationships would be considered sufficient to allow admission into the U.S. The guidance limited the allowable family relationships to parent (including parent-in-law), spouse, fianc&eacute;, adult son or daughter, son-in-law and sibling (whether whole or half, and including step relationships).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following on the heels of the Supreme Court decision and DOS guidance, the restricted qualifying family relationships (and entity relationships, in the case of refugees) were challenged in federal court in Hawaii. On July 13, 2017 the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii issued a ruling regarding the definition of &quot;close familial relationship&quot; as that phrase was used in the Supreme Court's decision. The District Court ruled that the administration's definition of &quot;close family relationship&quot; was unjustifiably narrow, and that grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces, and cousins are also included in the definition of &quot;close familial relationship.&quot; With regard to refugees, the Court ruled that refugees who have relationships with refugee service organizations or those that are part of the Lautenberg program would not be banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has appealed the Hawaii District Court decision to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the July 13th Hawaii court decision, the DOS issued updated guidance confirming that if otherwise approvable, consular posts will issue visas to visa applicants who can demonstrate one of the acceptable relationships, as expanded by the Hawaii District Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DOS also clarified that those applicants who applied for a visa and were refused on the basis that their U.S. family relationship was not &quot;close&quot; enough may re-apply if they can provide information that the relationship meets the expanded definition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BATTLE lines have been drawn - a red ring around the coast of Italy - and a small 'army' has been assembled by far-right activists who claim they will &quot;defend Europe&quot; from migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mediterranean mayhem: Right wing group set to sail for search and rescue zone outside Libya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Generation Identitaire' activists working for the Defend Europe movement are heading for the Mediterranean waters outside Libya where search and rescue missions are preventing mass drownings from packed-out dinghies and wooden boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lifeguards are bringing thousands to the EU once they are pulled from the perilous waters - but the sheer numbers are sparking a new backlash from young right-wing groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charities and NGOs are rescuing men, women and children desperate to flee war-torn Libya, but a crew on an anti-migrant boat called 'C-Star' refuse to accept their stories of rape, abuse and torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Sellner, a founder of the Austrian branch of the Identitarian movement has claimed the NGOs are &quot;luring people into the sea&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, they say they will put an end to daily drop-offs in Sicily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alt-right Canadian political activist Lauren Southern was on the first boat sent into EU waters in May, which attempted to block an NGO bringing migrants to shore in Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, Miss Southern said their mission was to record NGOs &quot;breaking the law&quot; and stop migrants being brought to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs accused GI of setting out to murder innocent people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children are among the thousands being brought to Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Miss Southern said the C-Star will attempt to ferry migrants back to Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;We will not cause anyone to lose their life, if there is a call for help or distress we have to follow the law and help people, but we will not be bringing them back to Europe, we will be brining them back to Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are little things we can do - we will not be harming people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NGOs are supposed to sink the migrant boats so they cannot be re-used and we are fairly certain they are not doing that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The astonishing claim was met with indignation by charities who accused Miss Southern of stunning naivety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Militia and government forces are fighting on the beaches daily, with many refugees being shot dead as they try to escape, say the NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kidnapping, torture and human rights abuses are part of daily life in the North African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet GI refuses to accept the situation is that bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Southern claims the rescue missions stop 'real' refugees from being able to make it to safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;The UN is a very pro-migrant organisation - yet it was they who reported 70 per cent of people coming are economic migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A very small percentage are coming because they fear for their safety and there is no distinction made by the NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are currently people, real families, who are stuck in these countries and waiting for legal asylum to Europe.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are families - and they are waiting five years because fighting age men are coming over illegally on boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is infuriating. The EU needs to approach this more responsibly instead of opening the flood gates and putting European lives in danger.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C-Star crew has hit a number of embarrassing issues early on in its mission, including crew being arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously known as 'Suunta', the boat is a Finnish-made research vessel flagged to Mongolia, owned by Sven Tomas Egerstrom, director of Marine Global Services LTD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ship was recorded as a &quot;floating armoury&quot; in 2014 leading to fears the crew could be armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the boat was searched in Egypt and authorities found no evidence of weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group was detained in the Suez Canal when its captain failed to produce a satisfactory crew list last week.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-racism and civil rights campaign, Hope Not Hate told Express.co.uk GI has failed to understand the situation unfolding in the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman said: &quot;We think these far-right activists are naive in the extreme and are only pouring petrol on the fire if they think they can rock up, with armed personnel, and begin harassing NGOs rescuing people in the water or trying to return refugees back to Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Libya is a failed state with two governments, competing militias, the presence of Islamic State and a coastguard which doesn't even control all the coast.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The comprehensive legal briefings we've commissioned to assist NGOs suggest that anyone returning legitimate refugees could possibly contravene the non-refoulement obligation under Article 33 of the 1951 SAR Convention.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Directly facilitating the onward transfer of those migrants/refugees to detention locations where their human rights would most likely be abused also contravenes that Convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, those who want a new start in Europe say they will die if they do not find income - as will their families in some of the world's poorest countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hope Not Hate said the GI movement is filled with Holocaust deniers and former neo-nazis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman said: &quot;People are free to debate and discuss the migrant and refugee crisis as much as they want, without including those who are talking about a 'reconquering' of Europe.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be lobbying all the relevant authorities, payment platforms, working with NGO partners and continuing to bring out further expos&eacute;s of Defend Europe and those supporting its mission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs and charities in the Mediterranean told Express.co.uk they will not be cowered by Defend Europe - and they will not stand back and let people die at sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C-Star mission has been crowdfunded by supporters all over the world - at the last count more than (EURO)110,000 was donated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Southern said people are &quot;voting with their dollar&quot; since they are &quot;too afraid&quot; to admit in Europe they do not want open door migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian said Defend Europe received so many applications from professional seamen to join the crew they were sifting through resumes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;We never imagined we would have a ship the size of the NGOs ships and that we would have it donated to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we can put donations towards other things like intelligence gathering and getting the crew here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had more people come forward and say they would like to get involved. There is the potential for even more boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martin called me and we were trying to decide who to take on board - we had enough military and sailors to have our own personal army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The crew is top notch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, those returning to Libya have told of experiencing some of the most vile human rights abuses imaginable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men have been jailed and sold on slave markets and women repeatedly raped, attacked, burned and abused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most have seen friends and family members murdered or - in the case of economic migrants - are out of work and starving in countries where dictators keep the military in arms and the people out of basic food and water.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mothers and babies are among those who Defend Europe want to sail back to Libya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Defend Europe supporters have claimed they are watching their society eroded by mass migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Southern said: &quot;The reason young people are so inspired is because they realise they are the last generation who have a shot at changing anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our children's futures have ben sacrificed by the flood gates being opened in Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last night Penny and Ronald Jones were devastated after it appeared they had unwittingly given their love and support to two teenagers embroiled in the investigation into the Parsons Green bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Jones, 71, and Mr Jones, 88, have been fostering since the 1970s, welcoming 268 children into their home, and were honoured with MBEs from the Queen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yesterday it was claimed they had been caring for the main suspect in Friday's attack, an 18-year-old refugee, believed to be Iraqi, who was arrested in Dover on Saturday, apparently trying to flee the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbours in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, said the teenager had been a problem' and that they had been contacting officials saying they were unable to cope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also thought the couple had in the past looked after Yahya Faroukh, 21, whose home near Heathrow airport was searched by police yesterday. As police searched the couple's suburban home at the weekend, a friend told the Daily Mail: To say they are gutted is an understatement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this to happen, after all the kids they have fostered, and for it to ruin everything... questions have to be asked about what checks were made and who decided to place him with them.' Even though Mr Jones is on the cusp of his tenth decade and uses a mobility scooter, the couple were coaxed out of retirement a few years ago by a deep-seated desire to help children fleeing war zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Jones said in a recent interview: We try and support where we can - because they've had bad lives. They just need to be loved.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the couple were awarded their MBEs at Buckingham Palace in 2009, Mrs Jones said: We open our hearts to all the children. Anybody that comes to us, we will do whatever we can to help them with whatever they need.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their latest charge, a teenager born in Baghdad who came to Britain as a refugee a couple of years ago via an immigration centre in Dover, was proving a handful, it was said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Griffiths, 28, who lives across the road, said: Police have been at this address a few times in the last couple of weeks.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Nye, a former foster child of the couple, said they had told him they had hosted some difficult teenagers' recently, adding: I really feel for the Penny and Ron. It's dreadful for them and it has made me quite emotional - they never asked for any of this and they have been so good to so many kids.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family friend Jim Adaway, 37, said the couple willingly took on refugee children after retirement, but admitted they had struggled with one of the youngsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: I think Penny was getting in touch with [the authorities] saying, &quot;I cannot handle this one&quot;. I don't know if it was the right decision to do this.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple, who have six grown-up children of their own, had given up fostering and were enjoying their retirement but in recent years were moved by the plight of children arriving from war zones. They have opened the door of their modest home to youngsters from countries including Iraq, Eritrea, Syria, Albania and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Jones said: You have to have patience and remember they've been through a lot - they're doing their best but nothing is going to happen overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's so rewarding. They're grateful to be safe, to have a bed to sleep in and to have food and [our support]... that's all they need.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One refugee was a 15-year-old boy who had smuggled himself into the country from Calais in the back of a lorry. Fostering refugees has involved accompanying them to Home Office appointments and helping them find a solicitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Jones said: Sometimes, watching the news, they can get so worked up that they have to leave the house and go for a walk - it's awful to see and it's so difficult for them. We just try and support where we can.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: They're all children - they just need to be loved.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicky Rider, 43, a neighbour of the Joneses, said: They are a lovely couple. I have known them all my life. They must be devastated.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another neighbour said: I feel for them both. They don't deserve this at this time of their life.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years ago father-of-four Rakan Almellehan made the heart wrenching decision to flee his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary school teacher packed his bags and, with his family, fled Daraa in Syria in the dead of the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaving behind his classroom, he didn't know if the children he taught would survive the war, never mind be able to complete theireducation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with his own family's safety at the forefront of his mind he left the city he had called home all of his life and fled to a refugee camp in Jordan with his children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the first day in the camp, his daughter Muzoon, then 14, looked around the damp tents and makeshift buildings and asked her father &quot;Where is the school?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so started her life as an education campaigner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years on, that little girl is set to fly to Hamburg and address world leaders at the G20 summit as the youngest ever UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiercely proud, Rakan positively beams as his daughter holds an award gifted to her by the Newcastle Peace and Unity group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Muzoon, now 19, the title is just the beginning of her journey and the determined youngster, who has found sanctuary from war in the Newcastle area, wants to become a voice for refugee children around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;I'm the first refugee to become a Goodwill Ambassador, it is a great thing I really appreciate it. It is a wonderful platform from which to fight for the right to education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a huge responsibility to speak on behalf of children around the world. I will do as much as I can to help them and be their voices and tell others about their difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want this appointment to be just a title of goodwill ambassador. I want to make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling the moment her life changed forever, Muzoon says her story began when the war began, turning the peaceful city she called home into a terrifying zone of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private firms banned from forcing asylum seekers to share bedrooms in Newcastle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;We were forced to flee our home. The situation was really difficult and we were forced to flee and leave everything behind. Of course I was sad, I didn't want to leave my home. I didn't want to leave everything behind, my friends, my relatives, my country where I was born and also my school. I didn't want to leave and not be able to continue my education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she and her three younger siblings arrived at the camp, Muzoon was shocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no electricity, no water and having to live in a tent with all her family her life had changed beyond recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However she said her life changed when she realised there was a school at the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That moment changed my life,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I realised there are no challenges in the face of getting an education, because by getting an education I can change this hard situation and I can make a difference in my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And from there her mission began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I got to the school I was shocked and saddened that there were so many girls there my age who didn't see school as a priority. I tried my best to encourage them and then I told myself to start my own mission and encourage people back to school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I started that in the classroom, anytime I met anyone I would tell them the importance or education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How Newcastle students are helping refugees fleeing war-torn lands settle in the North East</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I became known as a voice for the children, an advocate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Education is a right for children all over the world. There are children suffering, and I want to be their voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three years of living in a refugee camp, Muzoon and her family were able to move to the UK and settled in the Newcastle area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muzoon has just left school after spending one-and-a-half years there and is set to go to Newcastle College in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite moving to safety, Muzoon has pledged never to give up her fight for education and has become friends withMalala Yousafzai, the youngest ever Nobel Peace prize winner who was shot by the Taliban when she was just 15-years-old because of her education awareness work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muzoon said: &quot;Malala shes a remarkable person, we became friends, her friendship is a pleasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I came here I didn't stop my activities, I still fight for the right to education and I will do that forever. It is wonderful to go to school and I am lucky to go to school everyday and to live in a safe place but I am not going to be completely happy until every child has the same right and the same access to education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as she prepares herself to face some of the most powerful people in the world at the G20 committee, Muzoon has no fear about confrontingDonald Trump, Theresa May and Vladimir Putin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not nervous, I have something to say to them. I need to tell them education is a right, it is not enough to just offer shelter, they must also offer hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In the mid-1990s, Samantha Power, who later became US ambassador to the United Nations under the Obama administration, reported from Sarajevo for The Sunday Business Post <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 16, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Serbian rebel forces in Bosnia did what all prayed they would not and few thought they would dare, overrunning a UN-designated, ill-defined 'safe area', the lightning advance stunned the beleaguered UN Protection Force (Unprofor). The Bosnian Serbs stormed into the overcrowded town centre of Srebrenica, forcing the enclave's 42,000 Muslim inhabitants to flee. On Friday, the same fate faced the inhabitants of <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#381;</SPAN>epa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After two days of Bosnian Serb busing between Srebrenica and the nearest frontlines, UN officials estimated that some 15,000 civilians had been removed from the trampled enclave to government-controlled territory, making it one of the largest single 'ethnic cleansing' operations in the bloody 39-month war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Probably the Bosnian Serbs will go down in history books not only as the greatest violators of human rights and perpetrators of ethnic cleansing, but as the fastest and most efficient,&quot; said Unprofor spokesman Alexander Ivanko.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More worrisome, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) - which is supplying tents, blankets and water to the throngs of women, children and wounded in the northern Bosnian town of Tuzla - reckons that 2,000-20,000 people have vanished, including all men from 16-65. Serb officials said the men were being screened for 'war crimes'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God knows how many people are still in Srebrenica and what their fate is going to be,&quot; said UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski. &quot;We are afraid that some ugly things happened there and might still be happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnian and UN officials relayed refugee accounts of abduction, rape and cold-blooded murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have reports of hundreds of people lying on the side of the road, many of them with stab wounds, some naked,&quot; said Bosnian prime minister Haris Silajd<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#382;</SPAN>i<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#263;</SPAN>. &quot;These were people who were probably caught trying to escape through Serb lines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After boarding Serb buses in Srebrenica, the refugees - some of whom were wounded and carried on stretchers - were dumped at the edge of Serb-held territory, separated from their blue-helmeted escorts and forced to walk two miles across the confrontation line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladi<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#263;</SPAN>, who personally directed his army's successful infantry and tank assault on Srebrenica, publicly claimed &quot;all civilians, including Muslims&quot; were &quot;welcome&quot; to remain in Srebrenica, adding that those who &quot;chose&quot; to leave would be treated in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Unprofor officials said Serb treatment of the refugees was making a mockery of Mladi<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#263;</SPAN>'s proclamations. &quot;Forcing women, children and the elderly to walk across a confrontation line is hardly what the authors of the Geneva convention envisioned,&quot; said Ivanko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frontline march is just the latest chapter of hardship for Srebrenica's 40,000 occupants - an estimated 90 per cent of whom were forced to flee their homes in 1992 and 1993 in a widely-documented Serb ethnic cleansing campaign that saw armed banks of Serbs joining with the 'regular' rebel army to drive close to a million Muslims from their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the refugees ended up in the three eastern enclaves that the UN designated as 'safe areas' in the spring of 1993. Though it has been a rocky 39-month mission, it is hard to remember peacekeepers looking more feeble. Unprofor began by downplaying the attack, citing its 'limited objectives'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As late as the morning of the conquest, a UN spokesman in Sarajevo said: &quot;It is our understanding that the threat made by the local commander . . . does not reflect the position of the Bosnian Serb military leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout from the fall of Srebrenica could be immense. Unprofor officials blushed at their initial misreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our assessment was wrong,&quot; confessed Ivanko, &quot;people make mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they were also very quick to point to the probability of 450 lightly-armed Dutch soldiers using white-painted vehicles to stave off the tank-heavy Serb juggernaut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bosnian Serbs have learned the will of the international community, and the limitations of the forces deployed to deter them,&quot; said Lt Col Gary Coward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a refrain sounded at countless previous crisis points, but perhaps never before with such resonance, another Unprofor officer declared: &quot;The Serbs know what they want to achieve: victory. What, pray tell, does the West want Unprofor to achieve? Who wants to go to war? Just tell us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most ominous aspects of the Srebrenica debacle was the insight it gave into what a UN withdrawal will likely encounter - a red carpet from the Serbs, a gun barrel from the Bosnians. Dutch peacekeepers in the enclave attempted a microcosmic withdrawal just before the Serb conquest, hoping to abandon their observation posts in the face of Serb tanks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowing that relatively-demilitarised Srebrenica was doomed without their UN protectors, however, the Bosnian army forced peacekeepers to remain penned in their posts with grenade and gunfire. One peacekeeper was killed as he attempted to retreat; nearly 50 stayed put and were captured by the advancing Serbs. UN officials fear the fall of Srebrenica will only mark the beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The infantry-stretched Serbs need to free up troops by blotting out all three of the eastern Bosnian thorns in their sides, and they have seen the ease with which they can do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capturing even the tiny enclave of Srebrenica, the Serb secessionists have stripped the Bosnian government of a parcel of land which the five-nation contact group had proposed enlarging and linking with the <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#381;</SPAN>epa enclave to the south. In Sarajevo, contempt for the West ran high after Unprofor renounced air power and abandoned the exclusion zones here in June, but new events have exceeded even the most cynical expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the UN passed its 75th resolution on Bosnia, an exhausted prime minister Silajdzic sighed in a daily 1am interview: &quot;The UN should really stop passing resolutions it has no intention of fulfilling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[caption id=&quot;attachment_403619&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;] Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic listening to Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic (right) during a meeting with the press in Pale in August 1993. Last week, Mladic was sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity at international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia Pic: Michael Evstafiev[/caption]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovi<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#263;</SPAN> urged western leaders to stop appeasing domestic political audiences with their tough words and to start telling the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they cannot or will not do it, they should say it publicly,&quot; he pleaded at a press conference. &quot;The least they owe to this country are clear, unambiguous answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French statements that they might actually force the Serbs to withdraw from Srebrenica were greeted in Sarajevo with yet more disingenuous rhetoric, and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karad<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#382;</SPAN>i<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#263;</SPAN> responded smugly: &quot;What withdrawal? From our country? Srebrenica is our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling a spade a spade, as Izetbegovi<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#263;</SPAN> requested, while welcome in the abstract and novel in practice, will not do anything to hearten the Bosnian government. The eastern enclaves are the Serbs' for the taking, as they always have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big mistake by the international community was to lead the Bosnian government to believe they were ever going to defend those pockets,&quot; said one UN official. &quot;Can you imagine 75 Ukrainians fighting the Serbs of <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#381;</SPAN>epa?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All blue-helmeted heads have now turned to <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#381;</SPAN>epa and the other vulnerable eastern enclave of Gora<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#382;</SPAN>de, where 330 British soldiers are deployed. &quot;I don't think there is evidence on the ground that they are likely to do the same (to the two other 'safe areas'),&quot; said Coward. &quot;There is, however, rhetoric in the Serb press indicating that they might.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbs continue threatening, packing radio broadcasts with reports of the imminence of <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#381;</SPAN>epas's surrender, and warning that they would next set their sights on the more-fortified Gora<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#382;</SPAN>de pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Muslims in Gora<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#382;</SPAN>de carry on with their terrorist acts, using the status of the Gora<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#382;</SPAN>de safe area, sheltering behind it, in other words abusing it,&quot; warned rebel Serbs, &quot;that's precisely what we are going to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps rightly, given the meagre state of Srebrenica's defences, the fall of the enclave - the biggest defeat for Bosnia in two years - is being billed in the Bosnian capital not as a military defeat, but as a defeat for the United Nations. Shaken Sarajevo residents long for the day when their army is strong enough to allow them to wish good riddance to the blue helmets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While they curse British prime minister John Major, US president Bill Clinton and UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi - and slamming their doors in the faces of the most visible manifestation of the international community, western journalists - they swoop up the morning editions of the daily Oslobodjenje and charge up batteries to watch the weekly television programme, Path to Freedom, both of which depict heroic Bosnian soldiers erecting Bosnian flags on newly conquered mountain peaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Izetbegovi<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#263;</SPAN>, who had just returned from the field in central Bosnia, attempts to fuel flagging hopes. After devoting the first half of a press conference to demanding the United Nations use force to reclaim Srebrenica, Izetbegovi<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#263;</SPAN> then shifted to his chats with Bosnian army generals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We confirmed our determination to blockade Sarajevo by military or political means,&quot; he declared. &quot;The soldiers are convinced they are capable of doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A stunning Sudanese model who became a fashion icon after moving to the US from a refugee camp has detailed the cruel bullying she faced growing up, at the hand of classmates who thought her skin was 'too black'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyakim Gatwech, based in Minnesota, revealed in March this year that an Uber driver had once asked her whether she would bleach her skin if she were given $10,000 in exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anecdote resonated with her social media followers-she now has 325,000 on Instagram -and Gatwech, 24, has become a vocal advocate for self-acceptance, who often speaks out against discrimination based on skin color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Gatwech moved to the US aged 14, she lived in two different refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, after her family had to flee war-torn Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'My mother fled before I was even born, because there was a war. Soldiers would come and shoot the whole village, machine gun everybody down,' she told Cosmopolitan  in a new interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'She had to make her way with her children on foot to Ethiopia, and she lost my older sister - she passed away along the way. We were there until the UN left that camp. After that, we moved to a refugee camp in Kenya, where finally we were accepted into the United States.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model expected America to be 'like heaven', after sleeping in the refugee camp's tents and not having safe access to food and water, but faced ruthless bullying as she settled into her new country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recounting her classmates' taunt, she said: &nbsp;'They would say, you know, I'm too black, my skin is too dark. They'd be like, &quot;You don't take showers. That's why your skin is dirt.&quot; Or, &quot;Smile so we can see you, Nyakim. We can't see you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And then, in class, for example, the teacher would ask a question and say, &quot;Oh, Nyakim, can you answer that?&quot; A kid would say, &quot;Who are you talking to? We can't see her. She's not here.&quot; The whole class would start laughing, and I would just cry.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager, who was in the process of learning English, also struggled with the language barrier. She kept to herself and thought she would never make it as a model, because she didn't look like other people in magazines, on television, or online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;I could hear people saying under their breath, 'Oh my God, she's so black. Is that even normal?' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When her family moved to Minnesota the following year, the comments regarding her skin color continued.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I'd walk into the grocery store, and people would stare at me. I could hear people saying under their breath, &quot;Oh my God, she's so black. Is that even normal?&quot; ' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to make friends Gatwech  joined a track and field team, but ended up quitting after her teammates wondered out loud whether they would be able to see her clearly enough to give her the relay stick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bullying took such a toll on the future model that she considered bleaching her skin, but her sister, who went through the treatment herself, talked her out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'She said, &quot;You would not just be bleaching your skin, you would be bleaching your mind. I did it and I regret it. I'm not going to let my daughter do it, or you-nobody,&quot; ' the model recounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Gatwech finds ignorant remarks easier to handle. When the Uber driver asked her whether she'd bleach her skin for ten grand, she laughed and asked him why he thought she ought to change her appearance.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver was convinced the model would have an easier time landing jobs and finding a partner if her skin was lighter, to which Gatwech replied:&nbsp;'[Even if] being lighter would make my life easier, I'd rather take the [hard] road.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The negative reactions or comments don't affect me as much now-some of them I laugh at. But there are some that go deep and bring me down for a little bit,' she added in her latest interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Some people say I get followers because people feel bad for me, not because I'm actually beautiful. They say I'm the dumbest person ever. But there are millions more people who think I'm beautiful and give me positive feedback.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model has also inspired others to love themselves, including a young girl who told her she is now proud to be 'the darkest girl in the room'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I never imagined that somebody would feel like they've accepted who they are and love who they are because of something I did,' Gatwech said. 'That's my main goal, if loving myself and talking about it is helping people, I want to keep doing that. That's important.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Images of families and children in makeshift refugee camps around Calais and Dunkirk have disappeared from the media, but the refugee crisis remains unabated and, for those continuing to search for a more hopeful future, the situation is just as grim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why today I have co-sponsored a debate in Parliament to remind those with the power to change people's lives that this suffering continues and they have the tools to end it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week marked one year since the demolition of what came to be known as the Jungle camp in Calais. Although the timing of the decision taken by the French authorities was highly questionable, the spirit behind this demolition was right - no one should live in those sorts of conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I visited these camps on more than one occasion, spending time with families who felt that this location was their only option and the charities working tirelessly to provide support and advice to them. I met lots of children who were without adult guardians. For some their parents had paid traffickers to get them to Europe, to safety; for others they had lost their parents to conflict or become separated while fleeing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument goes (from those who seem intent on turning Britain into an insular and mean country) that these people have reached European shores, they are safe, so why do they seem so intent on coming to Britain? This desire is not the same for every person. Of those I spoke to, some wanted to come here because they could speak English; for others they had friends of family members who could help them settle in and restart their lives; and for some it was the recognition that Britain has always welcomed those whose own homes had become too dangerous. All of these reasons are legitimate, but for those with family already in the UK they have a legal right to be here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, out of the demolition the Government conceded to transferring 750 children to Britain, of which 550 were reunited with family here. These transfers should never have been a one-off. Rough estimates suggest that around 1,000 refugees are now in Calais and surrounding camps including an estimated 200 unaccompanied children. These people are not only vulnerable to the elements - using trees as shelter, they are also vulnerable to evil traffickers and others who would do them harm. For children, no place could be more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary colleagues from all parties banded together to secure a commitment from the Government to accept unaccompanied refugee children who had made it to Europe after treacherous journeys from flashpoints elsewhere in the world. This became known as the Dubs scheme, and we who fought for it, both in and outside Parliament, expected that the Government would offer sanctuary to thousands of children. We were bitterly disappointed by both the Government's initial measly quota of 480 unaccompanied children and their subsequent decision this year to close the scheme after allocating under half of those places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, with Brexit negotiations under way and family reunification rules on the table, we must ensure that vulnerable children continue to have access to safe and legal routes to come to the UK. There is no shame in reversing a bad decision, and that is what I will be asking ministers to do today by reopening the Dubs scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weather is turning once again and for many it will be the most bitter winter of their lives. It doesn't need to be this way. Britain must not turn a blind eye and betray our history as a compassionate and caring country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments before the would-be assassin tried to kill the mayor of this small and picturesque riverside town in the Sauerland hills of western Germany, he told him why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was thirsty, he said, as he pressed a foot-long butcher's knife to the mayor's throat. But rather than help his fellow German, the mayor had taken in hundreds of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks later, the gash in Mayor Andreas Hollstein's neck has largely healed. But the sense of profound shock in this tight-knit community remains. And the debate over his decision to make this economically precarious town a German model for the acceptance and integration of asylum seekers has only escalated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the attack, Hollstein - who credits the quick response of the immigrant family that runs the kebab shop where he was ambushed with saving his life - has been defiant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people may not like his humanitarian-based approach, he said while sitting in his office overlooking the town's imposing 12th-century castle, and a few on the extreme right may be angry enough to try to kill him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Hollstein said he had no regrets about taking in 450 asylum seekers, 100 more than was required under German rules for distributing the influx of more than 1 million people in 2015 and 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the right thing to do,&quot; said the blond, bespectacled and youthful-looking 54-year-old, a scar forming beneath his left ear where the blade pressed in. &quot;I'd do the same thing tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That puts Hollstein, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right Christian Democratic Union, sharply at odds with the political moment in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the continent, politicians wary of a voter backlash against those seeking a haven from war or persecution have sharply toughened both their rhetoric and their policies. Just this week, European Council President Donald Tusk proposed giving up on forcing countries to take in refugees after two years of largely failed efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet if Hollstein is out of step with the political mood, the attack on him is in keeping with the times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, the leading candidate for mayor of the western German city of Cologne, Henriette Reker, was stabbed in the neck as she campaigned in an election she would win days later while recovering in the hospital. Police said her assailant was motivated by opposition to her pro-refugee politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year in Britain, Jo Cox, a 41-year-old member of Parliament and passionate advocate for Syrian refugees, was shot and stabbed to death in her northern English district. A right-wing extremist who shouted &quot;Britain first!&quot; during the attack was convicted of her murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Tuesday, German federal prosecutors charged a soldier with plotting to assassinate top politicians, including the justice minister, and to frame refugees for the crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing trend toward violence comes amid a public discourse that has become far more poisonous and accepting of extreme measures against refugees and their supporters, said Dierk Borstel, an expert on the far right at Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a big problem for security services. The police used to know about the people who could be violent. There was tight observation,&quot; said Borstel, whose university is a short drive from Altena. &quot;But now the circle has expanded, and people who haven't been previously suspected are committing these acts. So it's very hard to control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said little about the man charged with the attempted murder of Hollstein beyond his first name, Werner. But locals in Altena described him as a middle-aged town resident who largely kept to himself and had fallen on hard times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of the attack, Hollstein had stopped for dinner at City Doener, a favourite neighbourhood gathering spot where native-born Germans, Turkish immigrants, Arab refugees and many others feast on sizzling kebab sandwiches piled high with veggies and hot sauce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had just placed his order when a man approached and asked if he was the mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Hollstein said he responded. &quot;Why?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPD agrees to coalition talks in major breakthrough for Angela Merkel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that, the man pulled out his knife and lunged, while berating the mayor for having taken in &quot;foreigners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a flash, Ahmet Demir, 27, was out from behind the counter where he had been making kebabs, and was trying to wrest the knife away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was just shocked,&quot; said Demir, who has lived in the area since his family immigrated to Germany from Turkey when he was twoand who has long worked with his parents at the family restaurant. &quot;There's never been anything like this in Altena. No crime. No fighting. It's quiet here. It's safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demir's father, Abdullah, joined him within seconds. His mother, Hayriye, dashed to the police station down the road. An officer's gun fixed on the perpetrator, it took several minutes of commands to drop the knife before he complied and let the mayor go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my mind, I knew it was a life-or-death situation,&quot; Hollstein said. &quot;I was lucky that (the Demirs) were there to help me. Without them, there was no chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next morning, his three-inch neck wound wrapped in bandages, Hollstein was back at town hall insisting he would not be intimidated. He would continue to do his job without police protection, he said, and to pursue a high-octane strategy for integrating refugees that has won the town a national award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of residents gathered for a candlelight march that evening. Merkel condemned the attack and called Hollstein to express her hopes for a fast recovery. Cards and emails poured in from thousands of well-wishers around the world, including the mayors of Barcelona, Milan and New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But mixed in with the mail were more than 100 letters of the sort Hollstein has grown accustomed to in the past several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry this man wasn't successful in killing you,&quot; said one. &quot;Now we will kill you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klaus Laatsch, a local spokesman for the far right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), said the attack on Hollstein was &quot;a really bad thing.&quot; But he can understand the anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you drive around Altena, it's a very sad place,&quot; said Laatsch, whose party this fall became the first from the far right to enter the German Parliament in more than half a century. &quot;And the mayor's the one who's responsible for a lot of the problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many small and once-mighty industrial towns in Germany, Altena has suffered as factories have moved away. A population of 32,000 decades ago has dwindled to just over 17,000 today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asylum seekers from the Middle East, Africa and Asia began making their way to Europe in large numbers several years ago, Hollstein saw an opportunity: The town had surplus housing that would otherwise be knocked down. It had schools on the verge of being shuttered because of under-enrolment. It had employers looking for young workers to train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollstein, whose grandmother fled to Altena from her home in Kaliningrad as Soviet troops advanced during World War II, said he also thought the town had a humanitarian imperative to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't solve everyone's problems here in Europe,&quot; he said. &quot;But we can do what we can do. And it was very clear to me that we could do more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond taking a higher share of refugees than required, Altena has stood out for its aggressive efforts to integrate the newcomers. At the town hall, a team of four helps to connect asylum seekers with jobs, guides them through the German bureaucracy and coordinates the work of an unusually large cadre of volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these days, the refugees need a lot less help than they used to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're independent. They're self-sufficient,&quot; said Esther Szafranski, a 50-year-old Altena resident and volunteer. &quot;The kids all speak German very well, and the adults are catching up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them is Nazeer Mohseni, a 29-year-old Afghan who fled a conflict zone more than two years ago and travelled six months to reach Germany. He now speaks the language, has a German girlfriend and walks the steep streets of Altena delivering mail as a postal trainee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I leave at 9 a.m. for my rounds with my letters and packages, everyone greets me with a smile and says, 'Guten morgen,' &quot;said Mohseni, who bears the scars of a bomb blast he survived five years ago. &quot;I feel very good here. There's security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But when I saw what happened to the mayor, I said to myself: 'How can this happen in Germany?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers from Call To Duty travelled to Bangladesh this month to deliver aid to refugees expelled from Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, in their own words is a detailed account of what they saw on the ongoing crisis involving the Muslims of Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Words by Amar Abbas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through donations they have delivered 1,250 family food packs, 5,000 People now have lifesaving food and the group helped to install a 1,000 metre Water Well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day 1/2 We've been on the road since 10am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We headed straight to the military liaison office who are co-ordinating all relief efforts.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found out the latest camp most in need, and headed straight over with 6 trucks, containing 1,250 Family Food Packs providing life saving food to just under 5,000 sisters, brothers, children and elderly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people were too grateful, thanking us constantly. It is as if we had done something special.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We reminded them that the people of the UK were the ones that made it possible, but it was in fact an honour for us to serve others. As the beautiful religion of Islam teaches us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Met a brother who lost his father during the massacre in his village. He described in detail the atrocities they suffered and their torturous journey from genocide in Burma to now starvation in Bangladesh.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Words cannot describe the emotions he displayed and I could not fathom any kind of response to console him, nothing - not a single word. Just a hug and a du'aa for his father who is Shaheed and will be granted Jannatul Firdos. Ameen&nbsp;<BR>As I lay here in my bed, all clean and warm - I keep thinking of the children who were sitting literally in ankle deep mud, with raw sewage and the stench.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day 3 It has been the most arduous day of our life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It started by visiting Sharpuri Island, commonly known as 'Point Zero'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is essentially the first landfall where most Burma-Muslims arrive in Bangladesh. The River Naf separates both countries: one committing genocide and the other a safe haven from the atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We assisted families arriving that morning with essential supplies. We offered bottles of water to a family that we met during the peak heat, who had been walking for 8 days straight. A small girl lay motionless on her father's shoulder.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As her father put a few drops of water to her mouth, she regained consciousness and became somewhat responsive. I witnessed the true power of clean water and will never see water the same way again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After physically assisting families, we then spent some time supporting families in the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We arrived at one camp at Maghreb Salaah (evening prayer), providing support to some of the 250,000 refugees (yes, a quarter of a million!) who were essentially sat on the bare ground with no food, no money and little hope.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst there, we were called to another camp following news that a child had died. We went quickly to see the funeral preparation of Abdul Shukur, age just 7.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father informed us that he had died whilst crossing the river, fleeing the Burmese Army and militia who had been hounding them for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family made it across the treacherous conditions today but sadly Abdul Shukur did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I performed his Salaat'ul Janaza in congregation and then had the honour of carrying his small and fragile body to his final resting place, before helping his father to bury Abdul Shakur.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even whilst writing this I am reflecting, and it brings me great sadness that Abdul Shukur suffered the way he did.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a father myself I cannot even fathom what it must be like to bury your own child. Abdul's &nbsp;father remained in a state of shock throughout.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This message is to the entire world - today a beautiful boy Abdul Shukur, age 7 died due to the genocide and persecution the people of Rohingya are suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also died because of the inaction of our political leaders, who now need to step up and be counted. Burma needs to be told that genocide in 2017 will NOT be accepted. Full stop. There must not be another single innocent death. The Abdul Shukur's of this world need to be able to live a safe, long and happy life.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day 4 It was our last full day at the camp&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We started off with distributing 3,500 hot meals to the 'New Arrivals' Camp. We met with refugees who all had a story to tell. Unfortunately, all the stories were of death, persecution and fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the camp, I met a brother from Burma, who described to me in detail how his immediate family of two sons and his wife, had survived their treacherous ordeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, he was made to witness his two sisters and their two daughters burned alive. He described their painful death, and how he reminisces about them all.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment he told me this, he burst into tears, as did I and everyone else listening. It was a heartfelt moment between men, who usually hide their emotions, all united in grief.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told me that his focus was now his two sons, and ensuring that their education does not suffer. He is home schooling them and wants them to be successful.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further told me that refugees were being persecuted for simply being Muslim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described how the Army there regularly rounds up men with beards and then literally sets the beard alight in order to set a deterrence and also to eliminate all religious leaders.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked him what can now be done to help the refugees, he replied - in a sentence: with dignity.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He responded that every human has his or her dignity and one must not forget this - even if the person is a refugee. He also said he refused to be labelled as a refugee, as he wanted to progress and provide stability for his two boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We went further to another camp, where we paid for a fresh water pump, with an electric generator to power the pump as well as a 14 cleaning station to be installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;I really do appreciate the value of water, every single drop.&nbsp;<BR>On the final part of our day, we went to complete a Masjid roof project. The masjid already existed but there was no roof and no flooring.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unsurprisingly, it was a challenge to use. We purchased bamboo and metal sheeting to cover the roof and also to install some flooring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it is our final evening here, I am sat here contemplating whether we have made a difference. The scale of need is huge; over 1.5 million refugees - yes MILLION!&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we being selfish to now go home to our homes and families and leave these sisters and brothers in this state?&nbsp;<BR>What is going to happen to them?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that I have had this perspective of life, what changes do I need to make to make an ongoing difference?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I leave this visit on a very solemn note, I leave feeling empty and deeply troubled. What world are we living in where genocide is tolerated and conveniently ignored.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day 5: With a heavy heart today we have left Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six days since leaving the comforts of home and spending many many hours in the refugee camps, we have achieved the following with your generous donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you so much for your support- your donations are still coming through (please keep them coming!).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next volunteer team is coming out at the end of October to deliver more aid. Donate at: www.justgiving.com/calltodutyrohingya</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE migrant crisis has been in full flow for three years but for English songwriter Nick Mulvey, the battle is only beginning for its victims' humanity to be recognised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulvey - one-time member of Mercury-nominated modern jazz act Portico Quartet - releases his second solo album, Wake Up Now, today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first single from the album, Myela, saw all profits go to the Help Refugees UK fund in support of the cause that inspired its writing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the concept of profits from music in 2017 may be laughable, perhaps more important is the fact a prominent musician feels the need to address such clear injustice three years on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In writing about such a sensitive subject - and one so detached from the experience of most western people - the Cambridge native felt it necessary, for credibility's sake, to remove his voice from the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than assuming the role of preacher and waxing lyrical about the injustice of it all, Mulvey chose to let the words of actual refugees do the talking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He set about gathering real-life accounts from online archives and let those form the basis of his lyrics, fictionalised to give a more universal narrative to individual experiences. Mulvey tells SFTW: &quot;I didn't feel there was much point in offering my own words about it because I don't have any specific experience to draw from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't pretend to guess at what it's like to live with that level of uncertainty that refugees must feel. So instead of creating my own words, I worked researching first-hand accounts in online archives, accounts of refugees telling their own stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then I fictionalised some of those through the song to have a more journalistic approach to it - a degree of distance and objectivity. That's in the writing of the song. But a song consists of many things - some of it is the words but a lot of it is the music and the feeling. The melodies and the way the song works, it was a space for me to express my sorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The song itself is an interesting mix of sounds, from African and Latin influences that make up Cuban music to lush jazz chords and west African choral vocals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's fitting that a song that attempts to shine a light on the refugee experience is rooted in the rich music heritage of the Mediterranean. He says: &quot;I had all of the chord sequences, which draw from the Spanish style, and it moves to this groove at the end that I felt was much more north or west African. And, of course, we know Spanish music deeply draws on the wonder of Islamic music and the beauty of Islamic culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It related to the Middle East. I had all these chords and I didn't have any words. And it was when I was talking with a friend, and I said, 'This song is very Mediterranean,' from that I thought, oh, this would be the right space to talk about the refugee crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was moved to speak, in part, by what he and many others view as confusing and disturbing coverage of the crisis, particularly from the right-wing media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Systematic attempts to dehumanise refugees on one hand, and cast them as selfinterested opportunists on the other, has characterised much of the coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulvey sees the track as his small part in the effort to redress that imbalance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says: &quot;It felt like a basic act of compassion from fellow human beings could acknowledge the humanity of those people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The surface differences between us are exactly that - they're very shallow. We have an overwhelming amount more in common than different, and I wanted to sing 'you are my neighbour.' I've been very confused, like most people out there, by a lot of the media coverage of the crisis. So I wanted to provide a little bit of content out there from my own platform, just to offer a different story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More generally, Mulvey feels the album should serve as a wake-up call for everybody - himself included - that the solutions to the world's burning questions begin at home. &quot;I think it's important that we approach a lot of the bigger questions about our time and the world we are creating with a new lens - a lens of selfenquiry. &quot;Asking very fundamental questions about what are we and who are we, that are born from realising we are more than just our labels and our identity. Identity is a very constructed thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's very interesting that, despite surface differences around the planet, we all have almost an identical nervous system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very, very similar under the surface, so musical expression has profound fundamental universality in the realm of basic pentatonic scales and basic form of the way tension and release works in music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are more than just the titles and the roles and the labels we assume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was very inspired by ideas around enquiring into the nature of self and the role it has to play in us answering bigger questions about climate change and global injustice and the survival of our species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you change yourself, you change the world - I think that's what this album is all about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, Wake Up Now is a joyful and celebratory album in spite of the sometimes difficult-to-understand and emotionally-charged subject matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a sense of celebration. Even if you haven't embraced the difficult subject matter, the album is joy-pop. It captures the energy we felt making it, and it's important because we won't succeed in any of the actions we need to do in the bigger picture if we act out of fear or guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That will create more of the problems we face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Falling deeper in love with the daily act of being alive is going to be really key to us understanding what we have to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This album is a celebration of being alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've been confused by a lot of the media coverage of the refugee crisis</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trawler carrying Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Burma has capsized, drowning at least five people, as the UN said the crisis has pushed more than 125,000 refugees into Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Residents of Shah Porir Dwip fishing village recovered five bodies from the Bay of Bengal, hours after the boat capsized at around midnight, said police official Yakub Ali. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear where the boat began its journey, or if the passengers had been among 450 detained by Bangladeshi border guards and ordered on Tuesday to return to Burma.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some border guards were letting refugees across the borders, others were sending them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi has blamed a misinformation campaign for fuelling the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with mounting numbers and a lack of space and basic supplies, Bangladesh said it will set up a new camp to accommodate Rohingya refugees who have arrived from Burma since August 25, many walking for days and crossing jungles and rivers to reach safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shah Kamal of the Ministry of Disaster Management did not say when the new camp would be ready. He said it will be established in Tyingkhali, south of Cox's Bazar district and near the established camp in Balukhali where more than 50,000 Rohingya have been sheltering since October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked officials to prepare a database with fingerprints for the new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of Rohingya fleeing western Rakhine state has reached more than 125,000, 80% of whom are women and children, said Unicef executive director Anthony Lake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many more children in need of support and protection remain in the areas of northern Rakhine state that have been wracked by violence,&quot; he said in a statement, adding that the UN refugee agency has no access to Rakhine trouble spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are unable to reach the 28,000 children to whom we were previously providing psycho-social care or the more than 4,000 children who were treated for malnutrition in Buthidaung and Maungdaw&quot; in Rakhine, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our clean water and sanitation work has been suspended, as have school repairs that were under way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence and civilian suffering have prompted international condemnation and resonated particularly in many Muslim countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Suu Kyi complained to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call that Turkey's deputy prime minister was a victim of fake news when he posted photos purportedly showing dead Rohingya that were not related to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photos on Mehmet Simsek's Twitter account have since been taken down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her office, Ms Suu Kyi said such misinformation helps promote the interests of &quot;terrorists&quot;, a reference to Rohingya insurgents whose deadly attacks on Burmese security posts on August 25 triggered the latest military crackdown and streams of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military has said nearly 400 people, most of them insurgents, have died in clashes. Security forces responded to the attacks with days of &quot;clearance operations&quot; the government says were aimed at rooting out insurgents it accuses of setting fire to Rohingya villages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has defended a policy encouraging refugees held on Nauru to sever ties with their families - including relinquishing all rights to ever see their children - in order to be considered for resettlement in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said on Wednesday that Australia's policy would not change but the UN children's agency and parliamentarians have all urged Australia to uphold international law and the unity of families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred refugees have been brought to Australia from offshore processing centres for medical treatment not available in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Border Force tells Nauru refugees to separate from family if they want to settle in US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In dozens of cases, their immediate family members have been left on offshore islands and told that, if they want to be considered for resettlement under the US deal, they must abandon their families, or encourage their families to return to offshore processing, even in defiance of doctors' advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton said the government's policy was that nobody brought to Australia from offshore for medical treatment could be considered for resettlement in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been clear on people who have received medical advice here: it was the reality for people on Nauru that if people left and came to Australia then consideration of their file would be suspended until they returned back to Nauru.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef Australia director Amy Lamoin said the UN's children's agency had consistently provided advice to the federal government on the importance of, and legal protections for, family unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Placing people in a position where they have to make an impossible decision - one that may have lifelong ramifications - to choose between their families and an option to live in a safe country with a feasible future is unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamoin said Australia's offshore processing policy had caused &quot;severe physical and psychological harm, and ... deliberately split vulnerable families&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unicef Australia urges the Australian government to consider the plight of children who have already suffered so much and to take steps to ensure that the identified vulnerable families, including children, can be reunited in an appropriate country such as Australia with adequate and ongoing support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several department sources, and sources on Nauru, have confirmed to the Guardian that it is &quot;unofficial policy&quot; to use family separation as a coercive measure to encourage refugees to agree to return to Nauru, or even to abandon their protection claims altogether. The department has said in public statements that families are separated to keep the number of people being brought to Australia as low as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the Guardian reported on the case of Iranian refugee Arash Shirmohamadi, who has never seen nor held his nine-month-old daughter, Yusra, after his pregnant wife was flown from Nauru to Australia because of health complications during her pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, four days after Yusra was born, an Australian Border Force official emailed Shirmohamadi a &quot;release of custody&quot; form that would have severed all of his parental rights to his child, potentially forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ABF told Shirmohamadi he had two choices if he wanted to seek resettlement: either separate from his wife and relinquish all rights to his child in order to apply to go to the US as a single man; or bring his family, including his Australian-born child, to Nauru to apply for a chance - but with no guarantee - of American resettlement together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US has, so far, preferred to take single people rather than families for its resettlement places and Shirmohamadi's wife has been advised by doctors not to return to Nauru because of ongoing complex health issues, and there is a court-ordered injunction preventing her return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian has obtained copies of the email, the release of custody document and recordings of a phone call with an ABF official in which the official tells Shirmohamadi &quot;if you want to keep your case together, your wife would need to be on Nauru... but if you wanted to progress in the US process without your family, it would be a matter of splitting your cases&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirmohamadi told the Guardian he faced an impossible choice and the government's policy might keep him from ever seeing his daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was not allowed to be with my wife for our child's birth and now they are saying to me, ' You must abandon your family ',&quot; he said. &quot;And they do it just to be cruel, just to cause pain to me and my family. To be heartless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration department declined to comment for the Guardian's story but issued a statement after it was published. It confirmed the Guardian's story that Shirmohamadi had been sent a release of custody form and was told that, in order to apply for the US, while his wife and child was in Australia, he would need to separate from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department said: &quot;No family units in Nauru have ever been forcibly separated by the department or the ABF. Claims it is 'unofficial policy to use family separation as a coercive measure' are also false.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian did not report that families were forcibly separated. In response to the statement, department staff again contacted the Guardian to state that family separation was deliberately, if unofficially, used to encourage refugees to return offshore, or to abandon protection claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood up to six refugees are in similar situations to Shirmohamadi, split from their immediate family members - including pregnant wives and Australian-born children they have never met. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, accused the Turnbull government of flouting international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're talking about tearing apart families here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family unity is a fundamental principle of international and Australian domestic law. Australia is a party to the convention on the rights of the child, which states that children have a right to know and be cared for by their parents, and should grow up in a family environment wherever possible. It is also a party to the international covenant on civil and political rights, which says the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A charity that helps refugees and asylum seekers by providing refurbished bicycles has been given a financial boost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bike Project, based in Dulwich, south east London, was presented with a cheque for &pound;1,000 by Imran Madden, UK Director of Islamic Relief.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money came from profits of a unique project that Islamic Relief participated in earlier this year - the UK's first inter-faith charity shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pop-up interfaith charity shop in Selfridges on Oxford Street celebrated and united the Muslim, Christian, Jewish and Buddhist communities. It was the idea of American artist and film-maker, Miranda July, and produced by leading arts organisation, Artangel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The design of the shop was a replica of Islamic Relief's charity shop in Whitechapel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islamic Relief has supported The Bike Project since January 2017. From January to December 2017, about 1,000 bikes have been donated - 200 of which are as a result of the funding from Islamic Relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imran Madden, UK Director of Islamic Relief, said, &quot;The Bike Project is a fantastic charity that we are proud to support. Providing refugees and those seeking asylum with bicycles really can make a difference to their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many have very little money to live on and having a bike saves on transport costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were honoured to have been chosen by Miranda July to take part in this unique art concept. Art is at the heart of many nations, religions and communities, providing an intimate and authentic view into another's culture and perception of the world. &quot;Taking part in Miranda's project has helped us to continue with our mission to support and save the lives of many of the world's most vulnerable people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the two months the shop was open, it was staffed jointly by four religious charities chosen by Miranda - Islamic Relief, Jewish charity, Norwood, London Buddhist Centre and Spitalfields Crypt Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Items for sale were donated by the public and typical of those traditionally sold in charity shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the project ended, the shop's profits were divided between all four charities, with each donating 2.5 per cent of their share to another charity of their choice. In the case of Islamic Relief, the Bike Project was chosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jem Stein, founder and CEO of The Bike Project, said: &quot;Once again I would like to say thank you to Islamic Relief for their continued support and for choosing us to share the profits from the inter-faith charity shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having fled persecution and atrocity in their country of origin, most refugees arrive in London with absolutely nothing. They have very little in resources. A weekly bus pass is &pound;21 a week so a bike is a free sustainable means to get around. It can help them access education, healthcare and food banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This donation will go towards the buying of gloves and reflective vests for refugees this winter so they can keep warm and cycle safely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bike Project take second-hand bikes, fixes them up and donate them to refugees and asylum-seekers. A small proportion of the bikes they receive are sold through The Bike Shop to generate funds, the proceeds of which support The Bike Project.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria Police said the woman, who drew police attention after she was bolted on to a car parked on train tracks at Ascot Vale with flat tyres, will face court on February 8, charged with conduct endangering serious injury and transport and traffic related offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her conduct charge alone could earn her up to five years behind bars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Moonee Ponds woman caused train delays of up to an hour ahead of the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday, and incensed 3AW  broadcaster Neil Mitchell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It was dangerous, stupid and disrupted people who wanted to have fun,' he said during an interview with Teachers for Refugees activist Lucy Honan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Honan and her activist colleagues have planned a protest at the Department of Immigration in Melbourne to follow up Tuesday's spectacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high school teacher told Mr Mitchell 'hundreds of teachers across Melbourne and Sydney' would wear politicised t-shirts to class on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shirts say 'Teachers for refugees' on the front and 'close the camps, bring them here' on the back.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I'm not keen to disrupt average people but I am keen to bring attention to [the situation on Manus],' she said of the car parked across the train tracks which disrupted hundreds of commuters.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The scale of crisis of a car on train tracks pales in significance compared to what's happening on Manus and Nauru.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, activists drove a blue Ford Laser on to train tracks at Ascot Vale.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group let the tyres down and fled when police arrived, leaving a woman bolted to the car's steering wheel, with the doors locked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the car, they had spray painted '#Justice4Refugees' and 'Evacuate Manus'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vehicle also held messages against horse racing, with one door reading: 'Phar Lap's revenge', and the roof proclaiming: 'Animal liberation = human liberation'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racegoers were forced to pile out of trains and walk to the Melbourne  Cup after they were brought to a halt by the graffitied car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers were warned by Metro Trains to expect delays of more than an hour as the Melbourne Cup's 3pm jump time loomed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police were left less than impressed with the bold protest.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They left the vehicle in situ with the tyres down and a female protester was bolted to the steering wheel,' Superintendent Tim Hansen told reporters at Flemington on Tuesday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police arrived at the scene, about 20 protesters scampered, leaving the woman in the car to be extracted by firefighters.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are really appalled at the situation on Manus Island and we think it's really inappropriate for people to be celebrating when there are individuals with no water and no security,' protester Sonia Arquette told AAP on Tuesday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group claimed they were not aligned with any organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We don't want to be doing this but we feel we have no choice when there are 600 people starving,' Ms Arquette said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate event, two woman also climbed a crane at Flemington racecourse, unfurling a banner which read 'SOS: Evacuate Manus Now'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hannah Patchett, 24, and Katherine Woskett, 27, scaled the crane, which is on site as part of a grandstand redevelopment, at about 11.30am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police contacted the protest group and negotiated with them and the women agreed to climb down, but not until after the main race.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall police said they were pleased with the behaviour of racegoers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six people were arrested for being drunk and disorderly at Flemington on Tuesday, one person was arrested for assault and one for offensive behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five people were arrested for other offences, and 33 people were evicted in total from the racecourse by security.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have been harbouring a craving for one of baking biker Selasi Gbormittah's vanilla sponges since seeing him in the last series of the Great British Bake Off, you're in luck. The show's famously Zen contestant is auctioning off the chance to win a three-course meal with him - and he will join you at the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all in aid of international children's charity World Vision and its Share a Meal appeal to help vulnerable kids.He boasts that he is both a deft cook and good company - just make sure you save room for dessert. Gbormittah is working on the appeal after a trip to Uganda, where he met South Sudanese refugees. Cooking for them made the task of impressing the Bake Off judges seem like a breeze. To know a place and its people, Gbormittah believes &quot;you must try their food&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took on World Vision's challenge to cook a meal with Rose, a refugee from South Sudan, and the 17 kids she looks after. &quot;It was a massive task to make something tasty out of sorghum [a cereal plant] and beans, which is all the refugees have to eat, every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he could even start he had to find wood for the fire. &quot;Rose's kids and foster family found it hilarious, because South Sudanese men don't tend to get involved in cooking. Philip, one of her brood, kindly claimed my meal was tasty because of the way I'd fried the onions. But in the end it was more about sitting together and hearing their stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 600,000 child refugees now live in settlements in Uganda, many having fled their homes after their parents were killed or abducted in the civil war. Eva, aged 16, fled South Sudan with her sisters. &quot;They were on their way home from school when they heard gunshots and saw dead bodies in the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People urged them to turn around and run back. They don't know what has happened to their parents. Eva now looks after her sisters Leyla, five, and Mary, 12, but they struggle. She finds it hard to make her rations last the month and they often go to bed hungry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Food is a common thread that connects us - wherever we come from,&quot; adds Gbormittah. &quot;Never has the importance of basic nutrition hit home so much. The monotony in their diet struck me, especially when - I'm ashamed to say - three days into the trip I bit into yet another sandwich and sighed. 'Cheese again!'&quot; If you're lucky enough to win the auction, Bake Off chat will be on the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gbormittah is watching this series and despite the new format finds it &quot;pretty much the same&quot;. He thinks Noel Fielding is funny, &quot;which is what the new bakers need&quot;, and predicts a girl will win: &quot;My money is on Sophie.&quot; His advice to the contestants? &quot;Stay calm and bake with the heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You'll naturally feel nervous but don't worry, Paul is a softie and gives great hugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A highlight was the &quot;Hollywood handshake&quot; he was given when his Yorkshire pudding passed muster. It was hard not being able to tell his family and friends he was on the show. &quot;Some thought I was being unsociable because sometimes I couldn't meet up because of filming. I didn't get much time to practise before episodes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he has no regrets. &quot;Bake Off was a great experience, and I met an awesome bunch of guys. I applied because I baked a lot at work and for charity, and everyone kept saying I was good but you can never tell if you are. It was exciting to go on the show and try to prove myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To enter the draw, post a photo from your meal on Instagram with the hashtag #shareameal and tag @worldvisionuk. Join Selasi by organising a meal for friends and family and collecting donations for the appeal here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">621 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horrific stories of children burned alive, women raped and men beheaded are emerging from the Rohingya Muslims crammed into the refugee camps of southern Bangladesh. They are among the 620,000 victims of Burma's brutal ethnic cleansing campaign and their plight demands the urgent attention of the country's neighbours, the wider international community and everyone with a shred of humanity. The unfolding tragedy shames us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the murders and mass expulsion are described in this newspaper today. At first victims died at the hands of machete gangs on motorbikes. Soon it became clear, as whole villages were set ablaze, that the Burmese military was running a vicious campaign in Rakhine state. Trapped on the Burmese side of the border with Bangladesh, desperate mothers tried to escape by improvising a raft made up of plastic bottles and bamboo. Children were swept into the rivers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times Christmas Appeal is backing an experienced charity, Children on the Edge, which already has a strong network on the ground in Bangladesh. Set up by the late Dame Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop, it has been working with the Rohingya Muslims for seven years. Successive Burmese governments have refused to accept the existence of the Rohingya as an ethnic group, claiming they were illegal migrants from Bangladesh. In fact, the overwhelming majority of Muslims living in Rakhine state were born in Burma and are denied citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children on the Edge has correctly identified the young as the most vulnerable in this exodus. It has in the past set up classrooms for refugee children in the Kutupalong camp in Bangladesh. Now it must scale up its activities. The breakneck pace of the expulsions, worse than anything since the Rwanda genocide, has left the usual aid infrastructure reeling. John Littleton, who works for the charity, has seen nothing to compare with this emergency in terms of &quot;the scale and the overwhelming sheer amount of human need&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The priorities are clear and urgent: to provide food, rehydration tablets, clean water in the camps, solar lighting and proper sanitation. The charity is mobilising partners in the field to expand all these basic services. The Kutupalong camp population is home to 325,000, a number likely to rise to 400,000. It is easy for children to get lost in this heaving multitude, so Children on the Edge intends to set up 100 learning centres, educating 10,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This and other aid efforts depend on the continuing goodwill of Bangladesh. Governments across the world should be helping what is already one of the world's poorest nations to support the Rohingya. Few of the refugees are ready to return. There is no guarantee of their safety, no homes to return to, no rights of citizenship and every likelihood that the whole miserable cycle of murder, rape and expulsion will begin again as soon as they are out of the international spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many, including Pope Francis, have urged Burma to change its ways. Those responsible for atrocities should be identified and sanctioned, especially senior military commanders. This is unlikely, however, to change the attitudes of generals who have ruled the country for so long in conditions of almost complete isolation. Pressure has to come above all from China, Burma's chief trading partner. If the misery of the Rohingya Muslims stokes the anger of a future generation of jihadists, China and other Asian neighbours will sooner or later be the targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the time being the goal must be to protect and educate those in the camps, and to conjure out of their dismal situation a glimmer of hope. Children on the Edge understands the scope of the problem. It is a deserving charity on the front line of tragedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 8,500 people have died or disappeared while attempting to cross the Mediterranean since the death of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed ashore in Turkey in 2015, drawing global attention to the plight of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the latest figures released by the UN's refugee agency, 4,337 people are believed to have drowned since September 2016 while attempting to reach European shores. Most departed from Libya bound for Italy, from Turkey bound for Greece or, more recently, from Morocco bound for Spain. A further 4,185 people died in the previous 12 months, from 1 September 2015 until the end of August 2016.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures have been released by the UNHCR to mark the second anniversary of the Syrian boy's death, which has also inspired Khaled Hosseini, the bestselling author of The Kite Runner, to write a short story about a Syrian father and son facing an uncertain future on a boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosseini's short story, Sea Prayer, has been transformed into a virtual reality project published by the Guardian on Friday, made in collaboration with the UNHCR. In it, the protagonist pleads with the waters to keep his child safe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosseini, a UNHCR goodwill ambassador, has been an advocate for refugees since 2006, travelling to Afghanistan, Chad, Iraq, Jordan and Uganda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photographs of Alan's body lying face down on the sand near the Turkish resort of Bodrum on 2 September 2015 dominated front pages worldwide, and touched a nerve with Hosseini. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way I thought about it, when I saw the photo, was all the unseen work that goes into the raising of a child,&quot; he told the Guardian in an interview. &quot;All the private worries, the private anxieties ... We worry and fret over their wellbeing, and to have done all that work, and see the person that you poured all that love and all that passion and all that work into, and to see that body lying face down on the beach ...&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Trying to block migrants won't work. Europe needs a realistic plan | Sophie in 't Veld</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR said that although the number of refugees arriving in Europe had &quot;drastically decreased&quot; since Alan's death, perilous sea journeys continued to result in the deaths of thousands. Clampdowns on routes to Europe via Libya and restrictions imposed on the Turkey-Greece route are partly responsible for the reduction in the number of people arriving, but this is leading hundreds to risk their lives crossing the Strait of Gibraltar from Morocco to Spain on inflatable vessels and rickety fishing boats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee agency urged the international community to take action to prevent further tragedies, saying in a statement that if poor conditions continued in countries such as Syria, people &quot;will continue to gamble their lives making desperate journeys&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the children trying to reach Europe travel on their own, making the journey even more terrifying and perilous,&quot; the UNHCR said. &quot;This was the case for 92% of the 13,700 children who arrived to Italy by sea in the first seven months of 2017.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  African and European leaders agree action plan on migration crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 120,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, with about 82% travelling to Italy from Libya. In June, Italian coastguards rescued about 5,000 people in one day in the Mediterranean. In August, 600 people were rescued by the Spanish maritime safety and rescue agency and the Red Cross in a single day. They arrived in at least 15 different vessels off the coast of Tarifa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosseini, whose books have sold 38m copies worldwide, was once a refugee himself, arriving in the US at the age of 15 speaking little English. His father was an Afghan diplomat working in Paris, and the family fled to the US after the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Hosseini practised as a doctor before embarking on his writing career.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many striking shots in Ai Weiwei's Human Flow, his urgent and compelling documentary about the refugee crisis, but the most arresting is perhaps the very last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of orange life jackets, left on the shoreline of the Greek island of Lesbos by migrants flooding in from Africa and beyond; the camera, attached to a drone, rises gradually over the mounds, which assume the vague shape of continents around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the celebrated Chinese artist, it was the perfect image to symbolise the plight of the world's 65 million displaced refugees. &quot;These are people who have been abandoned, like those life jackets,&quot; he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Still, today, there is no right programme. They are being treated by all kinds of policies, [ever] changing. They become a product.&quot; Human flotsam and jetsam, he suggests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously seen on screen in 2012's Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, about his trials with the Chinese government, Ai has frequently turned to film for his art, creating numerous documentaries, including a contribution to Don't Follow the Wind, a collaboration set inside the exclusion zone at the Fukushima nuclear plant that went into meltdown in 2011. Human Flow, however, is surely his most ambitious work yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those expecting a film about solutions to the refugee crisis might be surprised. Rather, it's a humane portrait that spans 23 countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, France, Germany, Greece, the US-Mexico border and Rohingya villages in Bangladesh. A year in production, involving 25 film crews and a dozen cinematographers, it's a remarkable feat. Much of it sees Ai on the frontline, on camera. &quot;I travelled part of it,&quot; he clarifies. &quot;A lot of locations you cannot get a visa, you have to use local people. And it's not an easy movie. If Continued from page 31 you want to make one story, that's easy; if you want to show the global condition, it takes a lot of people to work behind the scenes. Even the drones, you're not allowed to bring them into most nations. We got stopped in all kinds of locations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September, trade paper Variety dismissively dubbed it &quot;Refugees for Dummies&quot; (and plenty of stats do flash up on screen). But while the 140-minute film undulates wildly in tone, it's impossible not to be moved by some sickening scenes, notably as the camera trails a group of refugees repelled at the Macedonian border by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less focused than Gianfranco Rosi's award-winning Fire At Sea, which dealt with migrants off the coast of Sicilian island Lampedusa, it's nevertheless crammed with potent poetic images. &quot;I think it has to be presented to the audience as a first-class cinema experience,&quot; says Ai. &quot;I think it's tragic, but every tragic [situation] may also parallel with beauty. And that beauty makes us think and gives comfort - a contradiction to the film. So the film exists on different levels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no surprise that Ai should be drawn to such an emotive subject. &quot;I very much identify with the refugee condition because of my own life story,&quot; he explains. &quot;I was born a refugee. My father was punished the year I was born. They sent him to the most remote area in China. He did hard labour and was seen as enemy of the people and the Party. That lasted for 20 years. I never even dreamt we could leave. My father told us: 'Just think that you were born here.'&quot; First exiled in Manchuria, Ai's family was sent to a labour camp on the edge of the Gobi desert. His father, a poet who studied in Paris, was put to work cleaning toilets. He attempted suicide several times. &quot;He's been mistreated his whole life,&quot; says Ai, who believes his upbringing gave him &quot;essential, solid ground&quot; to approach a topic as vast as the migrant crisis. &quot;It's not foreign to me. I feel I can really talk to them, cut their hair, or eat with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai, too, suffered at the hands of the Chinese government. Once in favour - he helped design the Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics - his criticism of the Communist Party's stance on democracy and human rights left him persona non grata, and he was detained for 81 days at an undisclosed location in 2011. He now lives in Berlin, after the authorities unexpectedly returned his passport in 2015. Many of his friends are still in jail in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Needless to say, he wants Human Flow to be seen by people back home. &quot;The film should be shown in China. China has a very different kind of human rights situation. Tibetans are not allowed to travel. Rural people are not allowed to travel. And I was not allowed to travel. Everybody should see the film, and see some kind of reflection of themselves. But so far we still haven't had this luck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 60, Ai is instantly recognisable: the receding hairline, round belly and matted grey beard. But, despite frequently being on camera, he was recognised only once, by a Syrian economics student. Perhaps it says much about his ability to blend in, to empathise with those he meets - whether while cooking kebabs on an open fire or swapping passports in a touching exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has no desire to be seen as Ai Weiwei the artist. &quot;No, they should see me as an individual, who wants to be involved,&quot; he says. &quot;The intention is to get people involved, to understand the situation, and to speak out. It could be one sentence, it could be one image.&quot; As calm as he sounds, speaking in slightly broken English, he's boiling with anger inside, particularly regarding European attitudes to the issue. &quot;It takes global leadership to sit down and see how to prevent the refugee situation from war, from famine, from environmental problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He blames the media, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know how to help. We have enough resources, we're smart enough, we're privileged, and if we turn away, we shatter ourselves. We diminish our purpose.&quot; He looks downcast. &quot;It's the only way we can reward life, by helping another person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Human Flow' opens next Friday. A special screening/Q&amp;A with Ai Weiwei takes place on Monday, broadcast in cinemas across the country (humanflow.film)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justin Trudeau has sought to temper the notion that Canada is a guaranteed safe haven for those fleeing the threat of deportation in the United States, as his government faces criticism that its refugee-friendly messaging has given &quot;false hope&quot; to the thousands of asylum seekers streaming into Canada from the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the start of the year, more than 11,300 people have crossed into Canada by foot from the US. The pace has picked up in recent weeks, with as many as 250 people a day - many of them driven by fears of Donald Trump's crackdown on immigrants - entering the country at remote, unguarded locations. Doing so allows them to skirt a longstanding pact that bars most refugee claimants in the US from applying for asylum in Canada.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Activists challenge 'unsafe' US-Canada pact that prompts refugees to flee by foot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Canadians officials scramble to process and house the new arrivals - turning Montreal's Olympic stadium into a temporary welcome centre, deploying the military to set up a 500-person camp at the border and setting up a temporary tent city in a small Ontario city - Trudeau has set out to tone down the welcoming image his government has cultivated since taking power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For someone to successfully seek asylum it's not about economic migration,&quot; Trudeau told reporters this week. &quot;It's about vulnerability, exposure to torture or death, or being stateless people. If they are seeking asylum we'll evaluate them on the basis of what it is to be a refugee or asylum seeker.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he highlighted that Canada remains an open and welcoming society, his message to those crossing into Canada at unmarked locations along the border was pointed: &quot;You will not be at an advantage if you choose to enter Canada irregularly. You must follow the rules and there are many.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister has taken heat from opposition politicians who say his welcoming messages may have misled some into believing that Canada accept all migrants with open arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our system now is in shambles, and I think a lot of this has to do with the messaging - the inconsistent messaging - that has been coming out of Justin Trudeau's personal communication shop,&quot; said MP Michelle Rempel, the Conservative immigration critic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pointed to Trudeau's viral tweet - sent out shortly after Donald Trump moved to ban travellers from several Muslim-majority countries last January - which read: &quot;To those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rempel described the tweet as irresponsible, linking it to the surge of asylum seekers now streaming into Canada. &quot;I want to be perfectly clear. This is a problem that is of the prime minister's making. We weren't seeing this as an issue in the past, for a reason. Tweets have a great degree of import on the public dialogue,&quot; she said. &quot;I think he's giving false hope to people crossing the border.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Democratic party accused Trudeau of being intentionally misleading in saying that there is no advantage to entering Canada irregularly, citing a 2004 pact between Canada and the US, known as the Safe Third Country Agreement, which forces most migrants to apply for asylum in the first country in which they arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act means Canada must turn away most asylum seekers who attempt to enter the country from the US at official border crossings, said MP Jenny Kwan of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This leaves desperate asylum seekers with few options, and many feel they must take the risks of crossing the border in-between ports of entry,&quot; she wrote in a recent letter to Canada's immigration minister, Ahmed Hussen. &quot;If the prime minister was serious about reducing unsanctioned border crossings, let alone truly welcoming refugees, he would have already suspended the Safe Third Country Agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other organisations - including Amnesty International and the Canadian Council for Refugees - have long called on the government to suspend the agreement, pointing out that doing so would reduce the likelihood that migrants will brave freezing temperatures, fields of waist-deep snow and icy rivers to cross into the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters this week, Trudeau said his government was not considering changes to the pact. &quot;The United Nations has made a determination that even with the shift in immigration policies of the United States, they still fully qualify for holding up their end of the bargain on the Safe Third Country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks around 85% of those who have crossed into Canada are Haitians who have been living in the US, according to Canadian officials. In May, the Trump administration threatened to pull the plug on a longstanding humanitarian program, potentially exposing as many as 58,000 Haitians to deportation in 2018. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The rule here, is that everybody is welcome&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A welcome way to put an end to loneliness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At St Vincent's Support Centre in East Leeds, &quot;it doesn't matter what brings you here in the first place,&quot; you'll usually find a reason to come back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And come back, they do. Refugees and immigrants who initially come for English language classes come back week after week for an Art and Conversation group; someone using the charity shop may return for lunch; and people who came for help with debt struggles might return for counselling.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one thing that may go under the radar, but is in almost every service the centre offers, is help and support for those feeling isolated or lonely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why the crisis of loneliness shows no signs of slowing down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Centre manager Sheena Eastwood said: &quot;There are people who come to us because they live on their own, or their circumstances have changed, for example, if their partner has died and they go from having a full and active social life to having nothing. They come to us for lunch, just to take up a couple of hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the people who attend the centre's events and activities originally come to it for English classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, the charity Refugee Action published research as part of the Jo Cox Loneliness Commission's spotlight month on refugees found that refugees in Yorkshire had been left lonely and isolated because English language provision is &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities like St Vincent's, it said, were being forced to bridge the gap in provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2016/17, the charity taught 700 students English and IT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are new to the city and have little English it can be a strange and daunting place to find yourself in,&quot; Mrs Eastwood said. &quot;We offer more than just language classes, earlier this month we took a group out to the Yorkshire Dales so they could see beyond the city centre and practice their language at the same time. It's about making them feel part of the community they live in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre's own research among its English language students showed 86 per centre felt better able to maintain positive well-being because of the skills they had learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers are crucial to the running of the centre. In 2016/17, they give up 13,188 hours - time that would have cost &pound;94,954 if paid the living wage. Among the 85 volunteers at the centre are qualified counsellors who give up their time to help individuals in need. There is also free debt advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Eastwood said: &quot;We don't differentiate between our paid staff and volunteers. Both are absolutely essential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Art and Conversation class on Tuesdays is popular with a range of people, from retirees to new mothers to refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people come to learn to draw, some to practice English, but some simply come because they are lonely. It's a date in their diary each week.&quot; Mrs Eastwood said. &quot;There's no pressure to attend as it is a drop in, and our community cafe also offers a warm and welcoming hub.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre has been running Christmas Day dinners for four years, and also offers food hampers for people in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last year we had 14 people for lunch on Christmas Day who would otherwise have been on their own. Many of the volunteers would have spent the day alone too, so it's as much for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of our volunteers have been affected by loneliness, just like the people who come to us,&quot; Mrs Eastwood added. &quot;By volunteering, they feel like they are giving something back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To find out more about the services at St Vincent's, or volunteering, call 0113 248 4126.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yorkshire Post has been campaigning to highlight the devastating health effects of loneliness, which affects more than 90,000 older people in the region, since February 2014. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 2016, on the second anniversary of the campaign, we announced that Batley MP Jo Cox was launching a cross-party commission to tackle the issue. Following her tragic death in July last year, the commission was taken forward by her friend and colleague, Leeds West MP Rachel Reeves, and Conservative MP for South Ribble, Seema Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month we're backing the Commission's bid to get people to take responsibility for those in our lives who may be feeling lonely by simply starting a conversation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago yesterday the photograph of a lifeless little boy washed up on a Turkish beach went viral. For a moment, the indignity done to the boy and his grieving family seemed to offer hope that a prevailing political hostility to refugees fleeing to Europe would be overcome. Alan Kurdi became a symbol of the plight of so many others fleeing conflict and persecution in Syria and elsewhere. His tragic death laid bare the consequences of governments' refusal to provide the safe routes they and their families need to reach a place where they can rebuild shattered lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron, then Prime Minister, declared how deeply moved he was by the dead boy's image. He quickly announced a substantial expansion of what had been a tiny UK resettlement programme for Syrian refugees. But hope faded fast. Theresa May, as Home Secretary, spoke at the Conservative Party conference barely a month later. She vowed to reduce the number of people reaching the UK to seek asylum, and to be even less tolerant of those who did. &quot;Not in a thousand years&quot; would the UK join Europe in a common approach, she added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Leadership&quot; of this kind on this issue was not new from the then Home Secretary. Needless to say, it did nothing to help secure collective commitment across Europe to respect the right to asylum of people forced to seek safety by crossing the sea. Instead, various countries rushed to build more walls, fences and other less tangible barriers, from which smugglers and corrupt officials continued to profit by exploiting those needing to get past. And in spring 2016, with the EU Turkey deal, European countries agreed to pay Turkey to take back people who crossed to Greece while preventing others from making the journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This agreement has been celebrated by politicians and political commentators across Europe, including in the UK. Yet, since the deal tens of thousands of women, men and children have been trapped in limbo in Greece. Turkey has descended rapidly into authoritarianism with an increasing risk that many of its citizens will need to flee the country. And other countries have followed Europe in excluding and evicting refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the political soundbites about how UK Government policy has been to keep refugees &quot;safe in the region&quot;, the reality is that Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan have each been forcing Syrians back to conflict and terror while preventing others from escaping. But it doesn't end there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her 2015 party conference speech, our current Prime Minister looked back to when - as she somewhat modestly put it - &quot;despite its many flaws and its criminal leadership, Libya was known as Europe's forward border&quot;. The nostalgia for a time, in which British officials could work with a repressive Libyan regime to prevent people fleeing war and poverty from reaching Europe, was palpable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Government, like others in Europe, is once again dealing with Libya to try to block migration. But there is no Libyan regime now. Rather there are disparate parties, tribes and militias vying for power, legitimacy and money. In this chaos, migrants are especially vulnerable to exploitation - whether they came to Libya to work or already hoping to reach Europe. Slavery, kidnapping for ransom, torture and rape are just some of the myriad abuses and atrocities refugees and other migrants suffer in Libya. Whether held in official detention centres or by gangs and militias, they are at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As highlighted by Amnesty's recent report &quot;Europe: A perfect storm&quot;, supporting corrupt bodies in Libya such as the coastguard exposes people to these horrors. As European governments' assistance grows in trapping or returning people to Libya, they too will be complicit in human rights violations. Those vying for power - whether to run the country or control a neighbourhood - now see the chance of securing European money by promising to curb migration to Europe. While the cash flows, they may be content to shut down smuggling routes. If it dries up, they can reopen those routes - whatever pays best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why would they ever completely close these routes? Simply ending migration would remove their hold over those governments willing to pay or provide political backing. Meanwhile, there are other opportunities to exploit people who need to get out of Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years on from a moment when public and politicians cried &quot;never again&quot;, it is all too clear that our political leaders have not set out to end the death and suffering of people forced to flee, nor their mistreatment at the hands of armed gangs and corrupt officials. Rather, our leaders seem determined merely to keep as far away as possible the death and suffering of the children, women and men who - just like Alan Kurdi - have only smugglers and other abusers to turn to in their desperate search for safety. Out of sight, out of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deals that may temporarily slow migration at the cost of prolonging violence and suffering or exacerbating the root causes of why people need to flee are cruel and shortsighted. Governments must prioritise saving lives by maintaining search and rescue at sea while extending resettlement, family reunion and other visas for refugees to reach safety. Over the longer term, they must address those root causes - conflict, repression and global inequality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A car and knife attack on a police officer and a high-speed chase of a moving van that left four people injured was the work of a Somali refugee known to police for extremist ideology, Canadian authorities said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marlin Degrand, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said officers took a 30-year-old man into custody in the western Canadian city of Edmonton, Alberta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police declined to identify the man because he had not yet been charged, saying the pending charges included terrorism and five counts of attempted murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Degrand said the suspect was a refugee from Somalia who had applied for refugee status, and that he was known to both Edmonton police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Degrand said he was flagged in 2015 for extremist ideologies and that police had interviewed him at the time, but he said charges were not warranted after an &quot;exhaustive investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the best of our knowledge, this was a lone wolf attack,&quot; Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edmonton Police Chief Rod Knecht said an Islamic State group flag was found in the car that hit the officer, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it a terror attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident took place outside a Canadian Football League game at Edmonton's Commonwealth Stadium on Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police released graphic video showing a white Chevrolet Malibu ramming into a police officer standing in front of his cruiser. The officer flies into the air and the Malibu then crashes into the police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver gets out and appears to stab the officer, who wrestles the suspect to the ground and then rises as the suspect flees on foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seeing the video is very upsetting because of the level of violence and level of intent,&quot; Iveson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Edmonton police chief said Constable Mike Chernyk, a 48-year-old who has been an officer 11 years, was released from hospital with stab wounds to the face and head and abrasions on his arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was in a struggle for his life, holding on to his gun with one hand and blocking the knife with the other,&quot; Knecht said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours later, a U-Haul van was stopped at an impaired driving checkpoint north of downtown, on Wayne Gretzky Drive. Knecht said the name of the driver was similar to the name of the registered owner of the car that hit the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the van then sped off with police in pursuit. Police said the vehicle swerved at pedestrians throughout the chase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four people were hurt. Two were later released from the hospital and one was upgraded from a critical to a stable condition. Their injuries ranged from broken limbs to bleeding of the brain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The van eventually flipped over and the suspect was arrested after a Taser was employed. No shots were fired by police or the suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trudeau said in a statement that Canadians &quot;stand with the people of Edmonton after the terrorist attack on Saturday that sent an Edmonton Police Service officer to hospital and injured a number of innocent people who were out to cheer on their football team and to enjoy an evening in their city&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House condemned the attack and said US law enforcement was in touch with Canadian authorities to offer assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdulmonem Kitouh was on top of the world. It was December 2015 and he had just married the love of his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and Rana Damien had met in Aleppo, often in secret, because he was a Muslim and she a Christian. When the war in Syria upended their lives, he moved to Istanbul and she to Beirut, her family dead-set against the marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Damien's family moved to Canada after their asylum application was accepted, their opposition softened. She called Kitouh in ecstasy, telling him she would arrive at the airport the next day. They got married, and after three months of bliss in Turkey, Damien went back to Canada to finish her paperwork.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She would never use the return ticket. In January 2016, the Turkish government introduced fresh visa requirements for Syrian citizens, and Damien has been rejected three times without explanation. Meanwhile, Kitouh's application for an entry permit to Canada has been in limbo for more than a year. A love story that survived the Syrian civil war was brought to a halt by the cold logic of visa rules.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ask one of those visa officers to put themselves in my shoes for just a moment, to imagine that they're spending all this time away from the woman they loved,&quot; Kitouh said in an interview in Istanbul. &quot;When we were in Syria, we at least saw each other, even in secret. When we left Syria we could no longer see each other, because states stopped us from being together. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like I've lost so much of my life already, and I don't know why, just because I'm Syrian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  In Trump's America, immigrant families would be kept apart. He doesn't care | Sohaila Abdulali</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before Donald Trump's travel ban on nationals from six Muslim-majority countries to the US, Syrians endured onerous travel restrictions imposed by states in the Middle East and the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cities with high demand for Turkish visas, such as Beirut, waiting periods for appointments at the Turkish consulate can last as long as nine months. Applications are often rejected without clear reasons. Lebanon hosts 3 million Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Jordan, which hosts 600,000 Syrian refugees, it is difficult to get an entry permit unless you're attending a conference, and Egypt has introduced entry rules that can sometimes cost upwards of $3,000 (&pound;2,400) to circumvent. Many European countries simply do not grant visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resulting uncertainty has split families and forced refugees to navigate unsympathetic and byzantine immigration rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She fought the whole world so we can be together,&quot; Kitouh said. &quot;As Syrians we're always looking for a chance for salvation. Like those people who took the boats to find salvation from war, she was that for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oudai Alhomsi ended up taking one of those boats. In March 2012 he met Alaa Masalmaa in his city of Deraa, where protests had sparked the Syrian uprising a year earlier. She went to his shop to fix her laptop. Three weeks later they were married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to worry about him being taken to serve in the military when he went to work,&quot; Masalmaa said, teasing her husband. &quot;I would sometimes go to the shop so we could leave together and they wouldn't take him away from me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the army asked for Alhomsi by name, they knew it was time to leave. Masalmaa was seven months pregnant, but they made the trek across the border into Jordan, and arrived at the Zaatari refugee camp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was not easy but it was safe, you're not scared of death or detention, you don't sleep to the sound of gunfire, you don't worry someone will knock on the door and take away the most precious thing in your life,&quot; Masalmaa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a stint in the camp and then a Jordanian village in Irbid, where their son, Samer, was born, the family moved to Amman. But they knew they couldn't stay too long. They worked hard to survive and realised there was no future there. So they decided Alhomsi would follow the refugee trail to Germany, and then try to bring the rest of the family along. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journey took Alhomsi in October 2015 by plane to Turkey and then by boat to Greece. From there he travelled through Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany, where he eventually settled in Berlin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alhomsi applied for refugee status in November that year. It took a year for his paperwork to come through, only for him to find out he had been granted temporary protection status, which meant he was not eligible for family reunification until 2018. Alhomsi said he would appeal against the decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That day I cried the tears of two whole years,&quot; said Masalmaa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His son, now four, often runs out to their porch in Amman when a plane flies overhead and calls out to his father, thinking he is still on the plane he took in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss waking up in the morning to the aroma of coffee made by the hands that I love,&quot; Alhomsi said. &quot;A refugee is a human being, forced by circumstances to leave his country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed al-Taleb and Melina Nardi get to share a cup of coffee in the morning in Istanbul, but Belgian bureaucracy appears determined to keep them apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Taleb, a biologist, grew up in Damascus and left Syria in 2013 after being detained by the security services for taking part in protests. He was in the middle of pursuing a master's degree in immunology. He met Nardi, a Belgian-French-Italian marketing professional, in 2015 at a couchsurfing event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A little over a year later, they were engaged. But when they tried to get married in Turkey so they could begin the process of resettling in Europe, the Belgian consulate put up barriers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To get married in Turkey, residents need a &quot;non-impeachment&quot; document from their home country confirming that they are still officially single. Nardi said the consulate in Istanbul asked her husband-to-be to get a letter from the civil registry in Syria, have it stamped by the Syrian embassy in Lebanon and by the Lebanese foreign ministry, and then bring it to the Belgian consulate in Istanbul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Taleb, a 33-year-old who speaks four languages, cannot leave Istanbul because he is in the middle of an application for refugee status. As a result, their marriage is on hold while they search for other solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're not saying it like that, but it's clear they don't want me to be married to a Syrian,&quot; Nardi said. &quot;They never even accepted to meet me, all our conversations [with the consulate] were by phone or email.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nardi said the impossible demands by her home country's consulate were arguably unconstitutional, because they were putting up insurmountable barriers to her marrying the man she loves, a basic human right. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their goal is for me to say it's too complicated and I'm not going to marry him,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Taleb said he organised another engagement party earlier this month to cheer up his future wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I dont want them to steal our happiness and stress her out,&quot; he said. &quot;They were sucking the love out of our relationship, but they will not win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the couple just wait, trying to figure out a solution with the Italian and French consulates, with which Nardi also has citizenship. Her parents have always wanted to meet al-Taleb, but he cannot go to see them, and her mother has a perforated eardrum, and cannot travel to meet her future son-in-law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They spend their days visiting Istanbul's museums, walking around the city that brought them together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nardi has received a job offer in Spain, but refuses to leave al-Taleb, worried that his refugee application might get rejected and he would be deported. His brother lives in Spain, and has a doctorate in physics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm actually scared,&quot; she said. &quot;There is something new every day. I don't want to be away and one day they'll just decide to deport Syrians. I'd be leaving him in a country that is not protecting him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">529  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An independent film director who has travelled around the world documenting the refugee crisis is learning essential skills at the Google Digital Garage in Sheffield to help raise further awareness of the cause.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheffield-based Lucas Jedrzejak is well-known within the independent film industry. For the last 12 years, he has worked on projects covering a vast array of topics, from directing early music videos for the likes of Def Leppard to getting unprecedented access to boxer Ricky Hatton at the height of his fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent project has seen him travelling to over 30 countries, covering the refugee crisis and putting together a documentary where he is helping bring music and education to refugee children without access to schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet despite being an award-winning director with work regularly showcased on the film festival circuit, Polish-born Mr Jedrzejak still struggles to raise awareness of the projects to people outside the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a friend told him about the new Google Digital Garage opening in the centre of the city, he was keen to go along and find out how he could set up a new website and take control of the content he produces and actively promotes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attended a course on how to build a website and grow his presence online and intends to launch this to help promote the new documentary, Ketermaya, which tells the story of a group of Syrian children living in a refugee camp in Lebanon - and details how Lucas raised money to buy them a piano from Beirut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;In today's day and age, getting a film funded and distributed is extremely difficult, not just because commissioning editors are notoriously particular but because the market is becoming increasingly competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To get noticed, filmmakers usually start with a festival circuit where the most prestigious festivals pick a handful of films and the other 80 per cent get rejected. A festival tour normally takes at least two years of promoting your film around the world, which is time-consuming and costs a lot of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only other option is to create a huge online presence that is backed up by social media. To do this efficiently you have to understand SEO [search engine optimisation] and analytics and it's easy to get lost. For those reasons the Google Digital Garage in Sheffield is a wonderful place to start boosting your skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google's Digital Garage initiative is part of a multi-million pound investment offering everyone in the UK five free hours of digital training and is part of the Government's digital strategy, which aims to boost digital skills training in the UK by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May King Tsang, trainer at Digital Garage Sheffield, said: &quot;Whether you're a successful film director like Lucas, who is trying to get his work noticed by bigger audiences, or simply someone looking to find help in setting up an email address, the Digital Garage can help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've helped those who have never switched a computer on to others looking to learn the basics in coding. It doesn't matter your age, background or job, everyone should be able to make the most of the internet and we're thrilled Lucas is learning how to get such important issues even more visible online.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations' refugee agency has condemned Australia's forced return of an asylum seeker to Sri Lanka without any assessment of his claim for protection, saying the man is at serious risk of persecution in his homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR had sought assurances from the Australian government the man would not be removed from the country and would be allowed to apply for protection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Wednesday, the man was forcibly removed, in handcuffs, from Villawood detention centre and flown back to Sri Lanka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Sri Lankan man 'risks torture and rape' if deported from Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has maintained that the man was removed because he missed its October 1 deadline to apply for protection, and was deemed not to be seeking protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, lawyers for the man said he had a &quot;credible claim&quot; for protection, based on his Tamil ethnicity, and familial connection to the now-defunct separatist army the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Tamil Tigers. It is not suggested he was a member of the LTTE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man had struggled to fill out the 41-page protection application form in English unassisted, and was not able to access legal assistance before the deadline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With assistance from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, he lodged an application for protection during October but was told he had missed the deadline and his claim would not be assessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Sri Lanka is a refugee producing country. Here's why | Emily Howie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum seekers returned to Sri Lanka are routinely arrested at the airport, and jailed at Negombo before facing court. &quot;The use of torture ... [remains] endemic and routine, for those arrested and detained on national security grounds,&quot; the UN says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers and advocates for the returned man have not been able to contact him since he was returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the UNHCR, Catherine Stubberfield, said the UN was aware of a number of asylum seekers who were unable to meet the government's deadline of 1 October to submit their applications for asylum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since July 2012, people who sought asylum by sea were excluded from lodging an application in Australia for up to four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While they were all invited to apply by October 2016, some asylum seekers have been unable to complete this process within the time frame for a range of valid reasons, including a lack of access to legal representation. This was the case for the asylum seeker forcibly returned to Sri Lanka this week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'All is forgiven': Sri Lankan PM says returning asylum seekers won't be charged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a worrying breach of Australia's international legal obligations, Stubberfield said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this context, the return of an asylum-seeker - whose claim for international protection was not considered on its merits - presents a serious risk of return to danger or persecution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of ministerial deadlines, Australia is still legally bound by its non-refoulement obligations under the refugees' convention. It cannot return a person to a place &quot; where [their] life or freedom would be threatened &quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return of Tamils to postwar Sri Lanka, by Australia and other countries, remains controversial. There has been widespread reportage of the mistreatment and torture of prisoners by Sri Lankan security forces, including the systematic use of rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July the UN's special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights Ben Emmerson visited Sri Lanka and reported that &quot;the use of torture, has been, and remains today, endemic and routine, for those arrested and detained on national security grounds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Entire communities have been stigmatised and targeted for harassment and arbitrary arrest and detention, and any person suspected of association, however indirect, with the LTTE remains at immediate risk of detention and torture,&quot; Emmerson wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Sri Lankan Tamil refugee found dead on Manus Island</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1 October deadline was announced in May by then immigration - now home affairs - minister Peter Dutton, who accused asylum seekers of being &quot;fake refugees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven thousand asylum seekers, many of whom had lived for years in Australia without ever being allowed to apply for protection, were told they must meet the October 1 deadline. It is understood all but 71 met the deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's department of immigration declined to comment on the specific case of the man deported on Wednesday, but has commented on the return of Tamils generally, and its non-refoulement obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia does not remove people to Sri Lanka who engage Australia's non-refoulement obligations,&quot; a spokesperson said last week. &quot;Australia takes its non-refoulement obligations seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign has at times appeared something of a victory parade for Mrs Merkel, but just a year ago many were writing her political obituaries. Six months ago she still looked in trouble.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her decision to open Germany's borders to asylum seekers in 2015 was divisive. As the numbers pouring in became clear, her party plummeted in the polls, as did her approval ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mrs Merkel does win, it could be down to the asylum seekers she sought to help. Salah Mustafa, a Syrian refugee, is not religious, speaks fluent German despite not knowing a word when he arrived three years ago, works for a living and pays taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The softly-spoken 34-year-old lives in Cologne, the city that became synonymous with the controversy over Mrs Merkel's refugee policy following the New Year sex assaults of 2015. If Mrs Merkel faces a backlash from voters anywhere in Germany, you might think it would be here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But far from turning against her, Cologne has been at the heart of a remarkable comeback for Mrs Merkel, one that may be at least in part down to Mr Mustafa and others like him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love Cologne, it has been so good to me,&quot; he says, seated in a workingclass pub in the west of the city, at a mixed table of Germans and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel was derided for her migrant crisis slogan of &quot;We can do it&quot;, but the group gathered here is evidence that, in some cases at least, she may have been right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mustafa arrived in Germany in 2014, a year before the big influx. His home village in northern Syria was under the control of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil). He trained as a lawyer in Syria, but his qualifications were not enough to practise in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So he started again. He learned the language and found a job at a workshop that repairs electrical appliances. Eventually, he was offered a job at Bayer, the German chemical company, but decided to retrain as a social worker. After the New Year sex attacks of 2015, he was one of the organisers of a rally in support of the victims. With the overwhelming majority of suspects asylum seekers, Mrs Merkel's position looked even more precarious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She suffered losses in regional elections, while the AfD made gains campaigning on an anti-immigrant platform. The AfD moved clearly into third place, on 13 per cent, after Martin Schulz's Social Democratic Party (SPD), in yesterday's polls, and are on course to enter parliament for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in regional elections in May, the CDU made dramatic inroads in Cologne and surrounding cities, traditionally strongholds for Mr Schulz's centre-left SPD. &quot;Cologne has moved on,&quot; Wolfgang Gaertner, a CDU volunteer said. If the polls are right, Mrs Merkel and the CDU will suffer losses to the AfD in the former communist East, but will make gains in traditional SPD areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a case to be made that Mrs Merkel's refugee policy may even have helped her in these traditionally Leftleaning areas. Dr Carsten Koschmieder, a political scientist at Berlin's Free University, said: &quot;I'm not convinced people are voting for the CDU because of her refugee policy. Rather, I think people look at the situation and say it's under control. She said she could handle it and she's handling it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overhead pictures reveal that villages continued to be destroyed even as Myanmar and Bangladesh struck a deal last month to return refugees from the ethnic Muslim minority who had fled their country in fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York-based Human Rights Watch said&nbsp;buildings were destroyed in 40 villages in northern Rakhine state in October and November, increasing the total to 354 villages that have been partially or completely destroyed since August 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as the UN said violence against the Rohingya people could be classed as genocide.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 630,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar into Bangladesh since August 25, when Myanmar's army began what it called 'clearance operations' following an attack on police posts by a group of Rohingya insurgents.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees arriving in Bangladesh said their homes were set on fire by soldiers and Buddhist mobs, and some reported being shot at by security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late November, Myanmar and Bangladesh signed an agreement covering the return of Rohingya who fled across their mutual border to escape the violence in Rakhine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Satellite imagery confirms that dozens of buildings were burned the same week' the agreement was signed, Human Right Watch said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Burmese army's destruction of Rohingya villages within days of signing a refugee repatriation agreement with Bangladesh shows that commitments to safe returns were just a public relations stunt,' said Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch's Asia director.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The satellite imagery shows what the Burmese army denies: that Rohingya villages continue to be destroyed. Burmese government pledges to ensure the safety of returning Rohingya cannot be taken seriously.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar was formerly known as Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaw Htay, Myanmar's government spokesman, said, 'I cannot give comment yet because I have not seen the statement on the satellite images yet.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sann Win, a border guard police officer in northern Rakhine, said by phone Monday that 'there was no burning of any villagers' homes in October and November.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, Myanmar's government said more than 6,800 homes had been destroyed in the wave of violence, with all but about 200 of them belonging to Rohingya villagers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes after the&nbsp; United Nations human rights chief claimed the conflict could one day be classified as genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein hinted that he believed Burma's leaders could be charged if it is deemed they have not done enough to stop the trouble.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to BBC 's Panorama, which is due to air on Monday night, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights said it would not surprise him if genocide charges were one day brought before the country's leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: 'The elements suggest you cannot rule out the possibility that acts of genocide have been committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's very hard to establish because the thresholds are high but it wouldn't surprise me in the future if the court were to make such a finding on the basis of what we see.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the country's leaders are aware of the violence - which has seen dozens of people raped, killed and maimed and received vast media coverage - they could be 'culpable', Mr Al Hussein said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya Muslims have fled from Burma after intense violence which the UN described as 'ethnic cleansing', although authorities have blamed Rohingya militants for the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cross-party group of MPs found violence amounting to 'ethnic cleansing and may also constitute crimes against humanity and even genocide'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC said it had asked Burma's leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the head of the country's armed forces for a response but neither had replied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Koreans looking to get to the South travel via Thailand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thailand is a popular transit route for North Korean defectors, with the two nations separated by around 3,000 miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journey from the hermit nation to the freedom of the South can be undertaken through China in two ways.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is with the help of rogue people smugglers, although the cost of this can go into several thousands of dollars per person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the other means of escape is via secretive Christian networks operating out of Seoul - a route known as the &quot;underground railroad&quot; among Christian smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Nuclear shelter sales SURGE in Japan over North Korea Sarin gas fears  NORTH KOREA WARNING: Kim Jong-un could hit NEW YORK with missile  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clandestine leader of one of these Christian networks told PRI: &quot;When first get out of North Korea, they look really shabby and skinny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We usually make them stay at a church member's house for a month, just to eat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't just an act of kindness - it's more a matter of survival, with painfully thin North Koreans easily spotted by China's surveillance network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian smugglers are often faced with refugees who find China's landscape overwhelmingly modern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korean leader Kim Jong-un rules the hermit nation with an iron fist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One defector told PRI that he never eaten pork until he arrived at a Chinese safe house, recalling how his protectors also fed him cake on his birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cake is not common to North Koreans, with the defector describing the treat as &quot;an oddity, somewhat repellant&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once they look healthier, the refugees must evade the eyes of Chinese officials, as they continue their journey down to the border of Laos using public trains and buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then begins days of trekking, riverboats or even more buses, as defectors push through Laos to reach the Mekong River - and the Thailand border where they are able to find a police officer and request to be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest will result in South Korea negotiating their release before flying them to Seoul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There the North Korean defector will be debriefed, interrogated and finally released into South Korean society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the vast distance from North Korea, Thailand is in fact one of the closest reachable nations where North Koreans can expect government help to reach South Korea - the hermit nation's estranged sibling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'North Korea-to-Thailand' route has seen a surge in new travellers, according to data seen by Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news agency reports that 385 North Koreans were processed as unauthorised entrants in Thailand in the first six months of 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the influx continues, Thailand can expect to see almost 800 North Korean entrants by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korean defectors aim to be deported from Thailand to South Korea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An immigration official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said: &quot;An average of 20 to 30 North Koreans arrive each week now in northern Thailand alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For comparison, around 500 North Korean defectors entered Thailand last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South's Unification Ministry said 593 North Korean defectors had come to the South in the first six months of 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially, Thailand treats North Koreans who enter the country as illegal migrants rather than refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life in the secretive nation of North Korea is strictly controlled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thailand has not signed the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees and has no specific law on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unofficially, arrangements are often made between Thai authorities, the South Korean government, and defectors on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees rarely processes North Korean defectors in Thailand because of the arrangement between Thailand and South Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vivian Tan, spokeswoman for UNHCR Asia, told Reuters: &quot;People fleeing North Korea don't usually approach UNHCR offices as they have other ways of seeking safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the hilltops of Tarifa, the Spanish city that faces Morocco across the Strait of Gibraltar and mainland Europe's southernmost point, gusts of wind power the turbines dotting the landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the surfers who pack the city's hotels, the wind is a welcome sign of challenging waves. But for the Spanish coastguard and NGOs, the gusts are a warning that the record numbers of migrants and refugees attempting to cross the 10-mile strait are in grave danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of refugees and migrants risking the sea journey between Morocco and Spain has been rising sharply, and last week was an exceptionally busy one for rescuers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Salvamento Mar&iacute;timom, Spain's maritime safety and rescue agency, together with the Spanish Red Cross rescued nearly 600 people from at least 15 different vessels off the coast of Tarifa - the largest figure for a single day since August 2014, when about 1,300 people landed on the Spanish coast in a 24-hour period. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most attempt the crossing using paddle boats, but others use jetskis, inflatable vessels and rickety fishing boats. According to Frontex, the EU's border agency, more migrants are dying at sea this year than in 2016. And most who continue to cross know the risks they are taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We prefer to die than to stay there. Death happens once but we prefer to risk our life than stay there,&quot; said Abdou, 29, of the ethnic Amazigh community in the impoverished northern Rif region of Morocco, where hundreds of people have been arrested after recent protests against the state. He was rescued last week along with seven others from an inflatable Zodiac boat they had bought for (EURO)4,000 - a cheaper option that avoids the need to pay people-smugglers for passage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zakaria, 30, said he was saved by a helicopter last week after coastguards spotted him and others attempting to cross the choppy waters in another Zodiac boat. &quot;I was afraid. If the helicopter didn't come we would have died,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment you're in the boat, you're selling your life, but there's no solution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Larri, 22    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent clampdowns on routes to Europe via Libya have led to the increase in attempts to reach the continent via Morocco. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has said the number of people arriving in Spain by sea this year is likely to outnumber the number arriving in Greece. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to IOM, 11,849 irregular migrants and refugees reached Spain by sea between 1 January and mid-August. A further 3,500 have made it to two Spanish enclaves in north Africa, Ceuta and Melilla, the only EU land borders with Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Spain's numbers are dwarfed by those of Italy, which has seen 97,376 arrivals so far this year, there is significant pressure on Spanish authorities to make sure it can protect, register and accommodate those arriving on its shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns are also growing over the potential for militants to exploit migrant routes into Europe in the wake of terror attacks in Nice, Brussels and most recently Barcelona - all claimed by Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosa Otero, of the UN's refugee agency in Spain, said the country was not yet in an emergency situation, particularly when compared with Italy, but authorities were struggling to cope. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Spain lacks capacity to handle migration surge, says UN refugee agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the current rise ... there are no adequate structures and procedures in place to deal with more arrivals and to swiftly identify international protection and other protection needs,&quot; she said, adding that the shortcomings left migrants - especially children - vulnerable to traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every day, between three to four dark green buses marked Guardia Civil arrive in Tarifa to transfer new arrivals to the nearby city of Algeciras, where the Centro de Internamiento de Extranjeros (the alien internment centre) is located. Most arrivals are originally from the west African countries of Nigeria, Guinea and Ivory Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Red Cross, one of many NGOs active in Algeciras, provides asylum seekers with food three times a day and a place to sleep. On Saturday the centre's rooms were packed with children using computers. Women washed clothes outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdou was one of the men being housed at the Red Cross facility. He said the thought of the trip across the Strait of Gibraltar had frightened him, but he had been determined to make it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four men made the six-hour, 105-mile journey from Plaga Soaan in el-Hoceima to Motril, on Spain's south coast, on one jetski. They were kept in custody for two days upon their arrival before being taken to the Red Cross in Algeciras.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larri, a 22-year-old English-speaking refugee from Ghana, lives in a Cepaim house. He said he first tried to reach Europe via the Libya-Italy route, but nearly died when the boat carrying 35 people capsized an hour after their departure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only 12 people survived, the rest all died before our eyes, among them children and women,&quot; he remembered. &quot;I swam and caught the boat, until the next day fishermen came and saw us.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undeterred, Larri travelled to Morocco in an attempt to reach Spain across the strait. He said he belonged to Ghana's Bimoba ethnic group, which is fighting a long-running conflict with the rival Konkomba group. He had left Ghana for Libya as soon as he finished junior high school, in search of a better life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't know Libya was also fighting,&quot; he said. He worked in Libya for three years before going to Morocco, where he paid 1,000 dinars (&pound;82) to get on a dinghy with women and children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this weather, a lot of people die,&quot; he said. &quot;It's up to God, some people don't reach, some people reach.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether it was worth taking the risk, he said: &quot;Here, it's 100% better than Ghana. I was suffering, sometime beaten up on my way from Niger to Libya. When I see everything now that I'm in Europe, it was 100% worth taking the risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

For the surfers who pack the city's hotels, the wind is a welcome sign of challenging waves. But for the Spanish coastguard and NGOs, the gusts are a warning that the record numbers of migrants and refugees attempting to cross the 10-mile strait are in grave danger. The number of refugees and migrants risking the sea journey between Morocco and Spain has been rising sharply, and last week was an exceptionally busy one for rescuers. On Wednesday, Salvamento Mar&iacute;timom, Spain's maritime safety and rescue agency, together with the Spanish Red Cross rescued nearly 600 people from at least 15 different vessels off the coast of Tarifa - the largest figure for a single day since August 2014, when about 1,300 people landed on the Spanish coast in a 24-hour period. Most attempt the crossing using paddle boats, but others use jetskis, inflatable vessels and rickety fishing boats. According to Frontex, the EU's border agency, more migrants are dying at sea this year than in 2016. And most who continue to cross know the risks they are taking. &quot;We prefer to die than to stay there. Death happens once but we prefer to risk our life than stay there,&quot; said Abdou, 29, of the ethnic Amazigh community in the impoverished northern Rif region of Morocco, where hundreds of people have been arrested after recent protests against the state. He was rescued last week along with seven others from an inflatable Zodiac boat they had bought for (EURO)4,000 - a cheaper option that avoids the need to pay people-smugglers for passage. Zakaria, 30, said he was saved by a helicopter last week after coastguards spotted him and others attempting to cross the choppy waters in another Zodiac boat. &quot;I was afraid. If the helicopter didn't come we would have died,&quot; he said. Recent clampdowns on routes to Europe via Libya have led to the increase in attempts to reach the continent via Morocco. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has said the number of people arriving in Spain by sea this year is likely to outnumber the number arriving in Greece. According to IOM, 11,849 irregular migrants and refugees reached Spain by sea between 1 January and mid-August. A further 3,500 have made it to two Spanish enclaves in north Africa, Ceuta and Melilla, the only EU land borders with Africa. Though Spain's numbers are dwarfed by those of Italy, which has seen 97,376 arrivals so far this year, there is significant pressure on Spanish authorities to make sure it can protect, register and accommodate those arriving on its shores. Concerns are also growing over the potential for militants to exploit migrant routes into Europe in the wake of terror attacks in Nice, Brussels and most recently Barcelona - all claimed by Islamic State. Rosa Otero, of the UN's refugee agency in Spain, said the country was not yet in an emergency situation, particularly when compared with Italy, but authorities were struggling to cope. &quot;Given the current rise ... there are no adequate structures and procedures in place to deal with more arrivals and to swiftly identify international protection and other protection needs,&quot; she said, adding that the shortcomings left migrants - especially children - vulnerable to traffickers. Every day, between three to four dark green buses marked Guardia Civil arrive in Tarifa to transfer new arrivals to the nearby city of Algeciras, where the Centro de Internamiento de Extranjeros (the alien internment centre) is located. Most arrivals are originally from the west African countries of Nigeria, Guinea and Ivory Coast. The Red Cross, one of many NGOs active in Algeciras, provides asylum seekers with food three times a day and a place to sleep. On Saturday the centre's rooms were packed with children using computers. Women washed clothes outside. Abdou was one of the men being housed at the Red Cross facility. He said the thought of the trip across the Strait of Gibraltar had frightened him, but he had been determined to make it. &quot;What is important is that I've left Morocco, nothing else is important. We had a lot of fear, because the sea was sometimes peaceful, sometimes not,&quot; he said. &quot;There's war. The state of Morocco has conflict with [the Amazigh] people.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations committee against torture has advised the Australian government not to deport a Sri Lankan man, citing concerns he might be tortured upon return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Geneva-based committee of 10 independent human rights experts has issued an interim measure formally requesting Australia not to return the man while his case is considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, whom the Guardian has chosen to refer to as Jyran, was told on 6 December by the department of immigration to prepare to be deported imminently from Australia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Fast-track assessment fundamentally unfair to refugees, high court told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jyran faces arrest in Sri Lanka over his alleged links to the defeated separatist army the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - the Tamil Tigers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is not alleged to have been a fighter: his arrest warrant states he faces charges of &quot;assisting anti-government activities and supporting and assisting a terrorist organisation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tamil Tigers were ultimately defeated in 2009 after 26 years of brutal civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The asylum seeker, an ethnic Tamil, went through Australia's controversial &quot;fast-track&quot; refugee status determination process and was found to not meet the criteria for refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the fast-track system, no additional information can be brought after an initial protection application. Jyran did not present the arrest warrant in the first instance, later explaining he did not understand the Australian justice system and feared he would &quot;get in trouble&quot; because of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having failed to produce the warrant, his protection claim was dismissed as not credible, and the Immigration Assessment Authority, which reviewed his case, chose not to consider the document after being presented with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the UN committee heard that Jyran faced &quot;state-sanctioned torture&quot; if he were to be refouled. &quot;It is highly likely that the outstanding arrest warrant will be exercised on his arrival in Sri Lanka,&quot; Jyran's lawyer, Alison Battisson, told the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jyran will then be placed in custody. As a Tamil accused of assisting the LTTE, it is then highly likely that Jyran will be subjected to a range of torture practices, including rape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been widespread reportage of the mistreatment and torture of prisoners by Sri Lankan security forces, including the systematic use of rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July this year the UN's special rapporteur Ben Emmerson visited Sri Lanka and reported that &quot;the use of torture, has been, and remains today, endemic and routine, for those arrested and detained on national security grounds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Entire communities have been stigmatised and targeted for harassment and arbitrary arrest and detention, and any person suspected of association, however indirect, with the LTTE remains at immediate risk of detention and torture,&quot; Emmerson wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrest warrants over alleged links to the Tamil Tigers are often seen as highly politicised or based on limited, or no, evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Barnaby Joyce says New Zealand should 'back off' on offer to resettle refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battisson, the director of Human Rights for All, said the committee's interim measure highlighted the serious issues faced by Tamil asylum seekers facing forcible return from Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By issuing this measure, the UN recognises that Sri Lanka is not safe for Tamils, despite Australia denying refugee status to many Tamils.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battisson said she was relieved the committee against torture had chosen to act, and quickly, to prevent the potential refoulement of Jyran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These interim measures are quite rare - this illustrates the very real concern the UN has over Australia's practices of refouling Tamils to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is not safe for many Tamils to return to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian has sought comment from the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection on Jyran's case, and whether the request from the UN committee against torture will be acceded to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian understands that Jyran remains in immigration detention in Western Australia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benedict Cumberbatch stunned his audience when he delivered a foul-mouthed rant after his Hamlet performance at the Barbican, blasting the Government for agreeing to accept only 20,000 Syrian  refugees over five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, two years after the outburst, the Old Harrovian claims he and his wife, theatre director Sophie Hunter, 39, were so committed to the cause that they considered housing refugees  in their &pound;2.7 million Hampstead home - but decided against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'People were saying, &quot;You've got a home, why don't you house refugees?&quot; And we did look into it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But we had, then, a very new baby - maybe four or five months old,' explains the Sherlock star, 41, referring to his oldest son, Christopher.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Maybe people had a point. I understand why some might think I should be housing people instead of complaining about a government not doing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But I was trying to raise awareness that we can do more as a society. Because I do feel we are able to do more than just recovering bodies.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the Big Issue, the tireless thespian, now also a father to six-month-old Hal Auden, admits that despite the backlash he received for his nightly diatribes, he would do it again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I'm a human being and it was a human crisis and I got over-excited and said things in a rather grand manner some nights,' he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You stick your head above the parapet and that happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But we raised money for children in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'So I don't regret doing it for a second, and I will do it again, even if it does put me in the firing line.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 120 years, Country Life's 'Girls in Pearls' page has featured a portrait of a young lady making her entrance into society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former model Laura Montagu caused a stir in 2007 when she became the first divorcee to marry an heir to the Duke of Devonshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the Countess of Burlington, as Laura is now known, was amused to see a model, parade down the catwalk for Gucci in Milan this week wearing a sweater emblazoned with the warning words: 'Never marry a Mitford.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her husband Bill, who will inherit the magnificent Chatsworth estate in Derbyshire, is the grandson of Deborah 'Debo' Mitford, one of the society sisters who were the (much more classy) Kardashians of their day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharing a photograph of the sweater with friends, Laura remarked: 'What we're going to be wearing in Derbyshire next summer.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gucci sweater is thought to have been inspired by a handmade one that Deborah's husband, the 11th Duke of Devonshire, used to wear as a joke.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sitcom's co-creator, Alan Simpson, died in February at the age of 87, and probate documents now show he left a &pound;3.7million legacy to his widow, Tessa Le Bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer, who also co-wrote Hancock's Half Hour, left royalties from his books, screenplays and other work to Tessa, who was previously his manager. His first wife, Kathleen, died in 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simpson wrote Steptoe with Ray Galton, whom he met while they were treated for tuberculosis at Milford Sanatorium in Surrey as teenagers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small groups of hooded anti-capitalist Black Bloc militants scuffled with police after two days of violent clashes which marred the G20 summit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arab refugees watching the riots from the relative safety of a falafel joint said the rioters were insane for destroying their tolerant adoptive city and were astonished by what they saw as the police's restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If people did this in Egypt they would be shot,' said Ibrahim Ali, a 29-year-old Egyptian who came here in 2011. 'The state provides everything: housing, unemployment benefits and education. Yet those people are not happy. I don't get it.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They are crazy. I can't believe my eyes,' said Mohammad Halabi, 32, a Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee some 18 months ago. 'They have such a beautiful country and they're destroying it.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a night of rioting in which radicals looted shops, torched cars and hurled objects, the city centre was in lock down with luxury shops along the main streets barricaded up and many protected by security guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50,000 people gathered for a 'G20 - not welcome' demonstration in the port city. At one point a group of about 120 people, some masked, kicked police and attacked them with flagpoles before running away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police were once again driven to turn water cannon on protesters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamburg was left resembling a warzone after a second night of violent protests, with cars and buildings set alight, businesses looted and police attacked with petrol bombs.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         END COAL PLEA BY ENVIRONMENTALISTS                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenpeace activists have scaled a bridge in Hamburg and unfurled a banner saying, 'G-20: End Coal.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group said in a statement that 65 activists participated in the protest early Saturday demanding from international G20 leaders to act quickly to phase out coal and speed up global climate action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting global warming is one of the major issues on the G20 agenda, but negotiations are proving to be difficult since the US left the international Paris climate agreement a few weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenpeace's Susanne Neubronner said 'the millions of people threatened by climate change or already suffering its impact expect the G-20 leaders to accelerate their efforts to reduce their emissions'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 200 police have been injured in two nights of clashes, officials have revealed, and authorities say around 10,000 thugs were involved in last night's chaos.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after allegedly using a laser pointer to try and blind the pilots of a police helicopter.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday police bosses in Hamburg were forced to admit they had been overwhelmed, and requested reinforcements. Thousands of officers from across Germany have flooded the city's streets, and were pelted with Molotov cocktails and targeted with lasers last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A huge number of officers were on duty as tens of thousands of activists marched through the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arab refugees watching the riots from the relative safety of a falafel joint said the rioters were insane for destroying their tolerant adoptive city and were astonished by what they saw as the police's restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If people did this in Egypt they would be shot,' said Ibrahim Ali, a 29-year-old Egyptian who came here in 2011. 'The state provides everything: housing, unemployment benefits and education. Yet those people are not happy. I don't get it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali and two more refugees from Syria and Egypt were serving beer, falafel, hummus, tabouleh salad and other Middle Eastern delights to protesters who had started leaving the Sternschanze quarter as police special units moved in against the rioters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They are crazy. I can't believe my eyes,' said Mohammad Halabi, 32, a Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee some 18 months ago. 'They have such a beautiful country and they're destroying it.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's interior minister described the rioting as 'the opposite of democratic protest'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas de Maiziere said: 'These were unbounded violent excesses out of a desire for destruction and brutality.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that 'completely uninhibited attacks against people and objects, looting and arson by anarchists from Germany and Europe, have nothing to do with political motives or protest'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say riots were extremely violent in the early hours of this morning in the city's Schanzenviertel neighborhood.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fires burned across the city as the world leaders attending the G20 conference spent the evening listening to Beethoven's 9th Symphony and dining in style.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heads of state will come together later today to discuss issues including terrorism, climate change and trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riot police fired tear gas and water canons to disperse thousands of activists determined to soil the symbolic event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other protesters dived in the water surrounding the venue and were apprehended by police speedboats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protestors in the famously liberal city are furious at the estimated &pound;115million cost of the summit to German taxpayers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of officers went into buildings to arrest rioters while being attacked with iron rods and Molotov cocktails thrown from the roofs.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen activists were arrested when special units stormed one building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 500 people looted a supermarket in the neighbourhood as well as smaller stores. Cars were torched, street fires lit as activists built barricades with rubbish bins and bikes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some looters could be seen with baskets, filled to the brim with bottles of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police had made 70 arrests during the protests, which saw fires in the streets so large that they could spotted across the city's skyline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the two days, 197 police officers had been injured in the running battles with protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday chaos across the city meant world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, had to take alternative routes to the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the spouses of heads of state, including Melania Trump and Philip May, husband of British Prime Minister Theresa May, were forced to cancel visits because of security fears.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night anarchist protesters attempted to blind&nbsp; German  police officers and helicopter pilots amid violent clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shocking images show green lasers strobe the police lines in an effort to blind officers involved in attempts to secure the city.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement released today said the arrested suspect blinded the two crew members of the Libelle 2 helicopter so badly while they were up in the air that they had to stop working because they couldn't see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following intensive investigations, police arrested the suspect in his Hamburg apartment Saturday and also found the laser pointer.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the anarchist Black Bloc group - which wants to overthrow capitalism - split throughout the city, setting alight cars and looting shops while groups fight riot police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 20,000 police have been deployed in the northern German port city to protect world leaders attending the G20 conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German Chancellor&nbsp; Angela Merkel &nbsp;yesterday hit out at protesters after chaos in the city of Hamburg as thousands of demonstrators clashed with police on the day the G20 summit opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: 'I have every understanding for peaceful demonstrations but violent demonstrations put human lives in danger.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the touristy Pferdemarkt area, known for its trendy cafes and nightlife, activists faced off against police in riot gear who were unable to put out fires, with billowing thick smoke dramatically reducing visibility.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radical Black Bloc movement had some success in disrupting the leaders' discussions despite the ring of security around them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble cancelled an appearance in downtown Hamburg on Friday morning due to security concerns. Police also declined to clear US First Lady Melania Trump's motorcade to leave her hotel for a tour of the city's historic harbour, her spokeswoman said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marine police units intercepted 22 divers from the environmental pressure group Greenpeace who had also been trying to reach the concert hall, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they used water cannons to disperse protesters who broke into a riverside metro station that had earlier been sealed off. Nearby, two lorries were set ablaze.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1110 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last, devastating memory Rohingya teenager Janata Begum has of her mother is when a Burmese soldier hacked her to death with a machete as she could not run from their family home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janata, 15, and her brother Habib, 12, already fatherless, were forced to leave their disabled mother behind when the military attacked their village in Buthidaung, in Burma's northern Rakhine state, burning down homes and shooting civilians, early one evening in late August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, hid with neighbours in the forest for 15 days, inching their way towards safety in neighbouring Bangladesh through bursts of gunfire that felled people around them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were starving and we slept on the muddy ground in the rain and got bitten by lice. Sometimes the water rose up to our necks,&quot; Janata told The Daily Telegraph. They arrived heartbroken and distraught in the world's fastest-growing refugee camp, located near Cox's Bazar, southern Bangladesh, and which has officially absorbed 624,000 Muslim Rohingya refugees, but more likely closer to 700,000, since the military operation began on Aug 25.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the sprawling, dusty Kutupalong and Balukhali adjoining refugee camps, where 58 per cent of the inhabitants are children, orphans can easily be lost in the throng. Worse, they are vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma and Bangladesh are in the process of forming a negotiating team to thrash out the details of a pact agreed late last month to repatriate the bulk of the refugees within the next two months. But many families who are trying to sort through the wreckage of their lives and still looking for lost relatives, torn apart during the chaotic flight from an ethnic cleansing campaign by the Burmese military, cannot even begin to contemplate returning yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations this week said it could not rule out that genocide had been committed and called for the perpetrators to be subject to an international criminal trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trauma of bereaved children, many of whom have witnessed the slaughter of parents and have no home to return to, will be a lasting legacy of the crisis. According to the UN, close to 19,000 children have arrived in Bangladesh since August without parents, although the true figure may be higher. More than 5,200 have no relatives to care for them, creating &quot;child-headed&quot; households where teenagers look after younger siblings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janata and Habib found their paternal uncle through a Save the Children tracing programme which has reunited 24 children with their parents and 27 with other relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager said she was &quot;happy&quot; to have found him but she still feels bereft in the vast camp where food is scarce and she can no longer pursue her goal of becoming a seamstress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jane Alam, 12, is trying to locate his mother, whom he last saw as he and his three younger siblings and grandparents scrambled on to a boat to cross the Naf River into Bangladesh. &quot;We thought she was right behind us so we didn't worry at first,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his mother had disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having lost his father at sea eight years ago when he attempted to reach Malaysia, Jane now cares for his younger brothers and sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He finds some relief at a Britishfunded &quot;Child Friendly Space&quot; run by the UN children's charity, Unicef, where children can play and talk through their distress with trained counsellors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he arrived, his drawings of helicopters firing on burning houses revealed more than his words about the savagery he had witnessed. Now he smiles, interacts with other children and prefers to draw flowers, but his pain still runs deep. &quot;I miss my mother very much. She's very beautiful,&quot; he said. Case workers trying to trace her do not want to tell Jane that they have no leads, but like many Rohingya children, he has aged well beyond his years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think she has been killed by the military,&quot; he said matter-of-factly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of the crisis is hard to grasp. In just three months, a tent city the size of 2,300 football pitches, with a population greater than Washington DC, has sprung up across barren, unstable terrain and is still growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saiful, 30, who arrived last Thursday said military violence in Rakhine was ongoing. His uncle, Abu Jafar, had been shot in Puimali village only 10 days before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers privately dismiss plans to quickly repatriate refugees as a political smokescreen, as they fight to save lives in a health and nutritional emergency. Doctors are desperate to avert a cholera time bomb and to immunise young children from deadly bouts of measles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malnutrition rates were &quot;alarming&quot; among Rohingya children, said Shelley Thakral, a World Food Programme spokesman. One in four children under five are affected, with 7.5 per cent of them &quot;severe&quot; cases. In the feeding stations providing life-saving nutrition, dehydrated babies stare listlessly. Meanwhile, more than 60 per cent of the camp's water is contaminated with bacteria from temporary latrines, fuelling more than 36,000 cases of acute diarrhoea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to imagine more miserable living conditions. Yet Bangladesh, praised for its generosity towards the large influx of refugees, was last week criticised for reviving a &pound;200million project to house 100,000 on an isolated, flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal. Despite the threat of exile to a remote island and the desperation of camp life, few refugees said they were willing to return to Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nir Ahmed, 65, first fled to Bangladesh in 1978 when 200,000 Rohingya were driven out of Burma by a similar military operation. He stayed for six months, but this time he only wants to return if the Rohingya are given citizenship rights. &quot;People are very worried about the [repatriation] agreement. We suspect they will take us back to Burma and put us in camps,&quot; he said. &quot;I would rather tell Bangladesh just to kill us here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fear of what awaits in Burma has now filtered down to a new generation of children scarred by unspeakable recent horrors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sisters Tosminara, eight, and Yasminara, 11, said their father, a boat repairman, had suddenly been arrested by soldiers in their home in Dudaing village, Maungdaw. The girls learnt of his execution through mobile phone footage of his body. &quot;He had a bullet wound in his eye and one in his side,&quot; said Yasminara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly afterwards, the sisters' disabled mother told them to run for their lives, but could not join them. &quot;Now we don't know whether she is alive or dead,&quot; said Yasminara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss my parents very much. I don't want to go back to Burma. They will shoot us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'My father had a bullet wound in his eye and one in his side. I don't want to go back to Burma. They will shoot us'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The raw, grapefruit-sized wound was seared into the poor mite's head after troops in Myanmar released a hand grenade outside her home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it has turned septic and the eightmonth-old's mother Areta, 18, fears her daughter may not survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday Mirror made the difficult decision to publish the image to bring home the stark reality of ethnic cleansing - and raise awareness of the aid mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Areta trekked for eight days to escape one hell - Myanmar's Rakhine district, where Rohingya Muslims have been forced out by the military.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the to To GIVE Now she finds herself in another - a network of 12 slum camps across the border in Bangladesh where 700,000 weary refugees wait desperately for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Areta reached safety by boarding an overcrowded fishing boat to cross the perilous, rain-swollen Naf River. Now she stands on a sodden verge amid a sea of refugees waiting to be registered at Cox's Bazar - 70 miles south of Bangladesh's financial capital Chittagong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULLETS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Areta said: &quot;The military came to my home and fired bullets at my house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They tortured people in the village and then they set off an explosion, a bomb, near my house. My baby's head caught fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was nothing we could do. We tried to calm her, to keep her safe. We went to the doctor in Myanmar but there was no medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm scared. I do not know if my daughter will survive or die. I am her mother and tENTEd there's nothing I can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camps were swamped when Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina threw open the border after the campaign to oust the Rohingya people began on August 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half a million - more than Liverpool's population - have since arrived, on top of 200,000 already there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now sewers run openly through the soaked landscape as a putrid smell lingers over the 2,000-acre site. Deadly diseases threaten to sweep the tented cities while monsoon rains turn roads into quagmires, hindering aid agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We heard heartbreaking stories of execution, arson and sexual assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sajede Begum, 25, watched helplessly as troops and militia stormed Nabura village, in Myanmar's Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her daughters Yasminara, five, and Shokatara, seven, died when soldiers torched their wooden home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a blank stare, she tells of battling in vain to reach her children before the leaf-roofed home was reduced to ashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just seven days later her husband Mohamed, 26, was shot dead with a single bullet when the same troops returned. All Sajede could do was flee - just like Areta did. With her two-month-old daughter in her arms, Sajede made a six-day trek to the Bangladeshi border with her baby and surviving children, Rushmi, seven, and Safad, two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;My husband used to tell me we must leave. Then he was shot dsimt dead by the army. They didn't say anything, they just came in and shot him. They killed my children when they set fire to our home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tried to save them. Any mother would. I didn't know if I was going to die. Now I worry about feeding my remaining children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has described the &quot;cruel operation&quot; against the Rohingya as &quot;textbook ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts fear as many as one million - nearly the entire Rohingya population - could eventually reach Bangladesh. Most arrive at night to avoid being robbed by border bandits. On Thursday, 60 refugees, including dozens of children, died when a boat sank as they headed to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Hasina has been hailed by her people as the &quot;Mother of Humanity, champion of global peace and last hope for Rohingya refugees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RAPED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with more than 50 million people in poverty in her own country, a huge injection of aid is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN alone said it may need &pound;150million over six months to deal with the crisis. There are 250,000 child refugees and malnutrition is rife. One Unicef clinician said an eight-monthold orphan was a pitiful 6lbs 8oz - half the weight it should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slowly, aid agencies are setting up crude infrastructures to help support the influx of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a Unicef children's zone in the Balukhali makeshift settlement, dozens of youngsters laugh and play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But awful memories are never far away. Ishmat, seven, made a chilling throat-slitting motion as she told how military stormed her village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Abul, 14, has a scar under his eye. He tells how soldiers raped girls then attacked him with a stick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef 's Jean-Jacques Simon said: &quot;Imagine half a million people coming over the border in a matter of days. It's like an entire city being built from nothing in one of the poorest districts of Bangladesh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar's de facto leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has been criticised for not condeming the military - which she does not control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An independent tribunal in Kuala Lumpar last week ruled Myanmar was guilty of genocide, confirming rape, murder and brutal attacks. Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing, but has postponed a visit by UN officials and diplomats to Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leader Suu Kyi said the Rohingya could return. But many will be too afraid to go back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that leaves them battling for survival at Cox's Bazar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dan.warburton@trinitymirror.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kids beg for help, stampede for aid ...it's hell on Earth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From DAN WARBURTON in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOFT hands paw at your arms as desperate children beg for someone to end their nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other youngsters sit in stunned silence on the side of the roads connecting 12 refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of the crisis is overwhelming. These persecuted people may have escaped genocide, but they could never have expected life could be so dire. For these settlements are hell on Earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsoon rains and lightning storms threaten to tear down their makeshift homes, while downpours have washed away large swathes of land. When the rain subsides the temperatures soar and whip up putrid smells from the open sewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climb to the top of a hill and the camps seem endless. Blue tarpaulin sheets line the horizon for miles while men, women and children try to carve out an existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a stampede when a bus pulls up to hand out aid. One wailing girl clings to an open window, refusing to loosen her grip as the vehicle pulls away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid teams work tirelessly. I saw one British Unicef worker save three babies by getting them to a clinic in a rickshaw. They need a miracle here. I pray they get one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who are the Rohingya?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Rohingya are a historically peaceful Muslim ethnic group based in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine, bordering Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar is overwhelmingly Bhuddist and regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clan - one of the world's largest groups of stateless people - have been denied citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently there were more than a million in Myanmar. The Rakhines resent them and there was horrific violence between the two communities during World War Two. The current cycle of misery began in 2012 when rioting left 200 dead, mainly Rohingya. Muslims were largely driven out of the cities and 130,000 set up home in camps in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago nine officers at police outposts were killed in raids blamed on Rohingya. Similar attacks in August left 12 dead, triggering a crackdown by Myanmar military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has resulted in 500,000 Rohingya fleeing for their lives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office faced fresh criticism after confirming it has still failed to fill all the spaces it reserved for unaccompanied child refugees from Europe under the Dubs scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, described the government's approach as &quot;completely inadequate&quot; after it set out its position in its formal response to a report published by the committee earlier this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper also said her committee would hold fresh hearings on the subject in the future, saying that government claims to be serious about tackling modern slavery &quot;look hollow&quot; in the light of its unwillingness to help unaccompanied children at risk of trafficking on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2016, after defeats in the House of Lords, the government accepted an amendment to the immigration bill proposed by Lord Dubs requiring the Home Office to accept an unspecified number of unaccompanied child refugees from Europe for resettlement in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time it was expected that around 3,000 children would benefit from the scheme, but when the government announced details in February 2017 it said only 350 spaces would be available. That number was subsequently increased to 480.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, in its response to the home affairs committee's report, the Home Office said the number of children who had arrived in the UK under the Dubs scheme was &quot;over 200&quot; and that Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has written to her counterparts in France, Greece and Italy inviting more referrals from eligible children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be eligible, children have to have arrived in Europe before March 2016 and it has to be in their best interests for them to come to the UK. Priority is supposed to be given to those deemed vulnerable, including at risk from trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its response to the committee, the Home Office also said the total number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in local authority care in the UK was over 4,000 - around 10 times as many as may eventually be accepted under the Dubs scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismissing the Home Office response as complacent, Cooper, a Labour MP, said ministers should be doing much more to take advantage of the spaces for unaccompanied child refugees that were available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Contrary to speedily delivering the Dubs scheme, less than half the places councils offered at the beginning of the year have been filled even though unaccompanied refugee children are spending another winter in camps or other unsuitable shelters in Greece and Italy,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the government's commitments to tackle modern slavery look hollow when they are still resisting implementing a scheme to prevent teenagers being exploited and trafficked in Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This remains a policy failure by the home secretary and the committee will revisit this issue in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government came up with 480 as the total number of children it could accept after consulting with local councils to see how many they could take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home affairs committee report earlier this year suggested that a further 4,000 places could be available if councils received appropriate funding from central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Home Office response on Friday said that this figure was wrong because it was based on the assumption that a threshold for the maximum number of child refugees any single authority is supposed to take could become a target for all of them to meet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, is accused of running down a police officer with his car and then stabbing him repeatedly on Saturday night in Edmonton, Alberta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; and said he was both &quot;deeply concerned and outraged&quot; by &quot;this senseless act of violence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Sharif fled before driving a U-Haul truck into four pedestrians while trying to escape.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement said that Sharif did not appear for a scheduled meeting in January 2012 and efforts to locate him &quot;were unsuccessful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ICE statement added: &quot;Sharif had no known criminal history at the time of his encounters with ICE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Sharif made a refugee claim at a Canadian border crossing in 2012 and obtained refugee status later that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, a complaint led police to probe Sharif's alleged extremist ideology, but officers found no grounds for criminal charges despite an &quot;exhaustive investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Goodale said on Monday it would be wrong to blame the attack on any shortcomings in Canada's immigration and refugee vetting system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharif faces 11 charges including five counts of attempted murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awelcome piece of news last week was that Scotland has met a target to provide sanctuary for 2,000 refugees from Syria three years ahead of schedule. The UK government is committed to sheltering 20,000 people fleeing the country's war through the Syrian vulnerable person resettlement programme. Local authorities north of the border agreed to take in 10% of the total, all 32 Scottish councils signed up to help, and the goal has been reached just two years into the five-year scheme. So far, Scotland has accepted one in five Syrians who have arrived in the UK under the resettlement plan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we prepare for Christmas, it's a rare example of politicians across the parties singing from the same carol sheet. At an event in Edinburgh, Nicola Sturgeon said: &quot;Scotland is an open and welcoming country and today's celebration, welcoming the 2,000th Syrian refugee to our country, is testament to that.&quot;UK immigration minister Brandon Lewis commented: &quot;Scotland, along with the rest of the UK, should be proud of the way it has welcomed some of the most vulnerable refugees, and provided them with safety and security so that they can rebuild their lives.&quot; In Inverclyde, where I live, the council's Labour leader summed it up well: &quot;The Syrian resettlement programme showed Scottish local government at its best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd like to see bigger numbers as I think Scotland and the UK can do more, but rescuing even a single life makes an infinite difference. As the Talmud, the book of Jewish law, says: &quot;Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will never know what three-yearold Alan Kurdi might have gone on to achieve in life. In death, the pictures of his drowned body on the beach helped to shame the international community into some action. It's not just a question of morality. We know from the tens of thousands of Ugandan Asians and Vietnamese boat people taken into Britain in the 1970s and 1980s that our economy and society were enriched, both by their presence and the contributions of new generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who are hard-hearted against welcoming people to our country are also soft-headed. A European Commission report in 2015 found that refugees were having a &quot;sizeable&quot; positive economic impact on those countries accepting the greatest numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Scotland, we have a particularly acute demographic problem that we must solve. The independent Scottish fiscal commission forecasts that the population aged 16-64 will shrink from next year onwards, which is a significant factor in Scotland's trajectory of low economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the report says, these individuals &quot;are more likely to be working and will be generating the highest tax receipts&quot;. Quite simply, we need more young workers if we are to continue being able to afford quality public services. Otherwise, the needs of our ageing population will grow but the revenue to fund health and social care will fall short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In helping others escape war and squalor, we also help ourselves. The ties that bind us exist across the world, as well as within nation states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not a believer in God, but you don't have to be to value biblical teachings. The Book of Deuteronomy, chapter 10, verses 18 and 19, tells us: &quot;He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amen to that, and happy Christmas. @KevinJPringle</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prince visited the Danish Veterans Centre in Copenhagen with Prince Joachim of Denmark on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there he had a private meeting with the parents of 21-year-old Morten Krogh Jensen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Harry meets parents of soldier whose body he accompanied back from Afghanistan twitter 1                   </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry, 33, has previously told of returning from his deployment to Afghanistan with the soldier's coffin, as well as three critically injured British soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his opening speech at the Invictus Games earlier this year he said the flight changed the direction of his life and led him to create Invictus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking after the meeting on Thursday, Prince Joachim said: &quot;This (the soldier's death) was an eye opener for Prince Harry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a motivating factor for him, to start pushing, to establish the Invictus Games. This is the culmination of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;You've got to look at it (the soldier's death) from a very high perspective and say 'well, it was not in vain after all'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has benefited thousands over the last nine years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While at the centre Harry, who has been in the Danish capital on a two-day trip, watched a game of rolling football, which sees veterans lie on skateboard style boards, and met members of the Danish Invictus Games team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was reunited with Maurice Manuel, 41, a Danish veteran who has taken part in all three of the Invictus Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Harry meets parents of soldier whose body he accompanied back from Afghanistan twitter 2                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry was pictured kissing Mr Manuel on the head after he won a gold medal at the games in Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Harry met the veteran again, he joked: &quot;My lips have never recovered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day Harry had warned of the dangers of social media for young people when he met ambassadors for mental health campaign One of Us at a Danish bakery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;People are spending far too much time online and it's like a mental running machine that they can't get off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You wouldn't put your body through such a workout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm the last person to say ban it but people are suffering from mental fatigue and getting burnt out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his final visit of the trip, Harry met students at the Orestad Gymnasium school and told them he hoped to visit a refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicolai Moltke-Leth, 47, founder of True North school, who was leading a discussion about refugees with students, asked Harry if he had ever visited a camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry said: &quot;I want to, very soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just depends on when I have time to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to another group of students Harry apologised for the older generation but said he was hopeful for the younger generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I say your generation because I'm 33, despite the fact I'm still trying to clutch on to youth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;Your generation gives every single person hope, I promise you that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prince arrived in the Danish capital on Wednesday morning after flying in by private plane and started the trip by meeting Queen Margrethe II of Denmark at the Palace of Amalienborg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His trip to Denmark is the latest in a series of European trips made by the royal family this year, following last year's Brexit vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a reception at the city's Tivoli Gardens on Wednesday evening, he spoke of the &quot;strong ties&quot; between the two countries. He said: &quot;Our two countries have an unbreakable bond which is as strong now as it ever has been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Kensington Palace said there were &quot;no current plans&quot; for Harry to visit a refugee camp. In 2015 the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall toured a camp in Jordan, near the Syrian border, and described the plight of the refugees as &quot;heartbreaking&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry's girlfriend, actress Meghan Markle, is global ambassador for World Vision Canada, a charity which helps refugees and disaster survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past she has commented on how she combines her glamorous lifestyle with humanitarian commitments, saying: &quot;While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, coexist. And for me, they must.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Golriz Ghahraman last week stepped into the Beehive, the executive wing of New Zealand's parliament, along with her came her Twitter feed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My Twitter feed is going into the national archive, it will be interesting for others to see what happens when for the first time a Middle-Eastern woman, a refugee, ran for parliament here,&quot; says Ghahraman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both the support and the attacks.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian-born Ghahraman's Twitter page is a fascinating testimony to love and loathing in 2017. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  New Zealand election: full results give Labour boost and nation its first refugee MP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are the vile, racist attacks on her background and heritage. The suggestion that a terrorist has been elected to parliament, that she may enforce sharia law, smuggle a bomb into the debating chamber, or push back against New Zealand's socially progressive culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, to balance it, there is the love. The outpouring of support from elated New Zealanders. The words of encouragement from admiring Australians, worn down by years of that country's &quot;Pacific solution&quot;, cheers and congratulations from Brexit escapees and Trump survivors. All rallying around a woman who has proven the value and potential of every refugee life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Ghahraman the social media abuse was a reminder of what brought her into politics, and the Green party, in the first place - a life-long interest in protecting human rights, whether they be her own, or those of persecuted strangers on the other side of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012 Ghahraman shifted back to New Zealand after working as a prosector for the United Nations Khmer Rouge tribunal in Cambodia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could see something had changed in NZ and it wasn't for the better,&quot; she remembers. &quot;We were having our child poverty statistics criticized by the United Nations. We were doing things like prospecting for coal in our national reserves. Democratic institutions were eroding. Things like that kind of started to catapult me into wanting to be much more politically active.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghahraman arrived in New Zealand at the age of nine after her family fled Iran. They sought asylum at the airport after arriving on a plane from Malaysia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country accepted the Ghahraman family and they settled in West Auckland. They lived off state benefits until they secured employment, and adapted to the socio-economically diverse and multicultural precinct of New Zealand's largest city, where Golriz attended a high school whose student body was 70% Maori and Pacific Islanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in this South Pacific melting pot, says Ghahraman, that she acquired the confidence to study human rights law at Oxford University, and, later, to stand up in court representing the UN in tribunals prosecuting some of the world's worst war criminals, including perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My eternal gratefulness to New Zealand is that I got to grow up in a very diverse place. So the fact we didn't have anything was actually OK. I remember that freedom and getting to grow up with lots of different types of people; and that was just part of being Kiwi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final block of votes in this year's New Zealandelection were counted 14 days after voting closed, giving Ghahraman her seat in parliament after a nail-biting delay. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Green leader, James Shaw, said he was &quot;thrilled&quot; to welcome his newest MP to the house, taking the Greens' total number of seats to eight. &quot;In a time of increasingly divisive politics around the world, Golriz's election to our parliament sends a strong message about the kind of country New Zealand is,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghahraman was 20 when the Tampa crisis erupted; and the Australian government refused to accept hundreds of asylum seekers rescued by a Norwegian sea captain off the northern coast of the &quot;lucky country&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand's neighbour defiantly closed its borders, ushering in a draconian border protection policy that has been repeatedly condemned by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  New Zealand election result 'held hostage' by anonymous board of minor party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghahraman watched as Prime Minister Helen Clark put up her hand to take 150 of the Tampa refugees. She read their case files while interning at Amnesty International and heard the cheers of welcome from locals who gathered at Auckland airport to greet the bedraggled survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At that time, New Zealand really owned our solidarity with refugees and our lack of prejudice. I think comparative to Australia that still exists, but it has been eroded,&quot; says Ghahraman, citing the Tampa crisis as a galvanising moment in her career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since I was elected... I have realised Kiwis have really rejoiced and sort of owned that idea that we can stand as a counterpoint to these other developments happening in the world. That  politics of representation is becoming more and more important because of global political events. Whether it's Brexit or Trump being elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me to be able to enter the House of Representatives meant so many different things to so many different people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archiving of Ghahraman's occasionally tumultuous journey to parliament means New Zealanders will be able to look back on the first refugee elected to represent them. And representation is everything, says Ghahraman, because without a voice you become a stereotype, and when you're a stereotype, its easier to dehumanise you. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Post 9/11, I began to realise at least somewhere out there in the world I wasn't welcome and I wasn't trusted and I wasn't equal,&quot; says Ghahraman. &quot;It didn't matter that I felt Kiwi; it is the way people look at you. When they start blaming a whole group of people based on their race, or religion or ethnicity or nationality for something like terror, or any social ill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is the basis of all the atrocities I've worked on. That  is how it starts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE hand casually tucked in his pocket and the other clutching a Lidl bag, this young man could be heading to the shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But does this image show the Parsons Green bomber on his way to carry out the Tube attack? The footage was taken just 90 minutes before the blast on a packed District Line train. The man was captured on film near the home of Ronald and Penny Jones - the foster parents of an 18-year-old Iraqi refugee who is being questioned by police over the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shopping bag he is carrying is similar to the one that held the Parsons Green bomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primed with an explosive known as 'Mother of Satan', a timer and fairy lights, the device could have killed dozens. It failed to detonate properly, however, injuring 29.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, it emerged that the home of a second refugee, who is believed to have family in Scotland, is also being Turn to Page 4 Continued from Page One investigated over the attack. Police spent yesterday at the home of Yahya Faroukh, a 21-year-old Syrian who lives on the edge of Heathrow airport. In other developments: ? Neighbours claimed that the 18-year-old was a tearaway who was held by police just two weeks ago at Parsons Green station and had been spoken to by officers 'several times'; ? It emerged that he had been arrested by chance at Dover; ? There were questions over the child refugee foster system amid concerns about the 18-year-old's behaviour; ? Defence Secretary Michael Fallon demanded that internet giants do more to take down extremist material; ? The terror threat level was lowered from 'critical' to 'severe'. Although the threat level was lowered, sources claimed last night that police and MI5 were still hunticant', ing another Syrian suspected of being involved in the plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a dramatic 48 hours following the attack in West London, the 18-year-old who is suspected of planting the powerful device on a rush hour Tube train was arrested by chance as he attempted to flee the country on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police pounced on the 18-yearold, who has yet to be identified, when two unarmed officers from Kent Police spotted him at the Port of Dover at 7.50am as he tried to buy a ferry ticket to Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that as many as eight SAS soldiers were part of the operation in Dover. Witnesses described seeing the teenager being spoken to calmly by two officers, before armed police and special forces moved in to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after his arrest, which Scotland Yard described as 'signif-a second suspect was detained at a takeaway shop in Hounslow, west London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The identity of the 21-year-old was not released, but police were yesterday searching the home of Syrian refugee Faroukh, in the shadow of Heathrow. He also previously lived in Sunbury with the Joneses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the arrests Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced that the terror threat level had been reduced from its highest level of critical to severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country had been warned that a terrorist attack could be 'imminent' after the Parsons Green suspect went on the run, but yesterday the immediate danger appeared to be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the 18-year-old suspect and Faroukh are thought to have arrived in Britain several years ago as refugees, having travelled across Europe to get to the so-called Jungle camp at Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an unaccompanied child the teenager was allowed entry to the UK and after being processed through a migrant centre in Kent, was found a home with the Joneses. The family are also thought to have taken in Faroukh who had travelled from his native Syria for a better life here in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police swooped at the home of the foster parents on Saturday, where bomb disposal experts were brought in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbours were evacuated from surrounding homes amid fears of a second bomb being hidden at the suburban property, which was still being searched last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday neighbours described the 18-year-old living there as a teenage tearaway and it was claimed that he had been spoken to by police many times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation sparked speculation that US President Donald Trump was right when he tweeted about the suspected bomber being 'in the sights' of Scotland Yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This caused a diplomatic row because Theresa May and police both condemned his 'unhelpful' intervention. Yesterday it emerged that Mr and Mrs Jones, who took the 18-year-old in after he arrived in Dover three years ago, were 'at the end of their tether' with the youngster after a series of run-ins with the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carers have raised 268 foster children over three decades - including eight refugees. They were awarded MBEs by the Queen for their services to children and families. But friends said they had been unable to cope with the 'problematic foster child' who was said to be out of control. Questions were being asked yesterday about why he was placed with the Christian family after concerns from the 18-year-old's Muslim relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of their former foster children said the Joneses had taken on 'difficult teenagers recently' including an Iraqi refugee who fled Baghdad, arriving in Dover three years ago and a Somalian boy, both of whom were placed with the couple from a refugee centre in Dover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night a close family friend said the foster parents, who are now staying with friends, were distraught at his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'To say they are gutted is an understatement,' the friend said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For this to happen, after all the thousands of kids they have fostered and for it to ruin everything.' Aaron Nye, a former foster child of the couple, said: 'It's shocking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I really feel for the Penny and Ron. It's dreadful for them and it has made me quite emotional - they never asked for any of this and they have been so good to so many kids.' His mother, Tracy Nye, said the 18-year-old had been trouble for the couple. Neighbours on the quiet street said one of the teenagers living at the property had been arrested at Parsons Green station two weeks ago but was later returned home. Serena Barber, 47, said: 'They have two boys at the moment, both are foreign. One is very quiet and polite, the other, who is 18, is awful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I know about two weeks ago he was arrested by police at Parsons Green, for what I don't know and returned back to Penny and Ron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'After that Penny said she was going to have to stop caring for him, she couldn't handle him.' Stephen Griffiths, 28, who lives across the road, said: 'Police have been at this address a few times in the last couple of weeks. At the time we just put it down to it being foster kids that needed to be spoken to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Why couldn't something be done sooner to stop this happening? Why couldn't the police have questioned him? 'Three or four officers would turn up and would speak to the foster parents on the doorstep.' Another neighbour Dave Solway said the refugee wanted to run away, while one mother of two said there had been clashes about placing the Muslim teenager, who spoke Arabic, with Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: 'I asked the younger one if he wanted to come to my church to help settle in and meet people, he didn't. His main family are Muslim, they are not happy he is with a Christian family.' Comment - Page 18</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigel Farage has received a standing ovation from supporters of the German far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) party, as he whipped up anti-EU sentiment and urged voters to be &quot;bold&quot; in challenging their country's status quo. The former Ukip leader injected debate about Brexit into the German election after receiving a personal invitation by the MEP Beatrix von Storch, a leading figure of the anti-immigration party - and the granddaughter of Hitler's finance minister, Lutz von Krosigk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the Spandau Citadel in the west of Berlin a fortnight before German voters go to the polls on 24 September, Mr Farage, the MEP for South East England, was greeted with huge applause by the crowd of a few hundred people gathered for the occasion. He urged AfD supporters to take note of the enthusiasm that made Brexit possible and stand up to their country's establishment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party, the AfD has seen its popularity grow after it monopolised the anti-refugee sentiment following Ms Merkel's open-door refugee policy, which has allowed more than a million refugees and migrants to come to Germany in the last two years. Yet the event showed Ms Von Storch was keen to return the debate to the party's Eurosceptic roots. The AfD is expected to win its first parliamentary seats in the Bundestag (the German parliament) in the upcoming election, and could possibly become the third biggest political force in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once you have the opportunity, once you have the space to challenge the establishment, to challenge the status quo, you have the opportunity to make the country think and that is an opportunity but also a responsibility,&quot; Mr Farage told Ms Von Storch and her AfD supporters. &quot;Once you are able to speak the unspeakable, people will begin to think the unthinkable and that is how you beat the establishment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters, Ms Von Storch, hailed Mr Farage as &quot;a role model&quot; and &quot;the man who made the impossible possible&quot; in reference to Brexit the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elected as an MEP in 2014, Ms Von Storch joined the right-wing group Europe for Freedom and Democracy (chaired by Mr Farage) in April last year, after being expelled from the more mainstream European Conservatives and Reformists Group for saying border guards should shoot at women and children trying to cross the border illegally. She later tried to amend her comments saying the use of firearms against children was &quot;rightly, not allowed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Farage praised Germany as being the &quot;strongest and most powerful&quot; country in the EU, before adding it also had &quot;generous taxpayers&quot; making the biggest contribution to the EU budget. Capitalising on his audience's Eurosceptic sentiments, Mr Farage said he was &quot;amazed&quot; Brexit had not been an issue in the German election debate. &quot;It doesn't matter if you think Brexit is a good thing or a bad thing; it is the biggest challenge the EU has ever faced,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Farage warned far-right voters that if a tariff-free trade deal was not agreed between the EU and the UK, it would be &quot;pretty serious for Germany too&quot;, adding that Germany has sold at least &pound;30bn worth of goods to the UK per year. &quot;Trade is a two way street. If it [Brussels] denies a good deal to the UK, it is denying a deal to the German workers. It is in our common interest if Brexit is being negotiated successfully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Farage said the motion behind Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US &quot;is still rolling&quot;, and he urged the German voters to be &quot;bold&quot; in challenging the status quo in their own country. Mr Farage also slammed conservative candidate Angela Merkel and her centre-left rival Martin Schulz for refusing to discuss Brexit, because it was &quot;a huge embarrassment to the European political dream&quot;. He described Mr Schulz, leader of the centre-left SPD, as &quot;a fanatic&quot; for his belief in a strong EU, and added Ms Merkel would be more likely to be receptive to the business case for a tariff-free trade deal between the UK and the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With two weeks to go, I would urge Beatrix [von Storch] and others to challenge these people and make of Brexit a debate that matters. You have an opportunity to do well out of this, and you also have an opportunity to do something better and greater for the people of Germany,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AfD has been a strong critic of the eurozone and the bailouts which were paid out to Greece. It wants a referendum on leaving the eurozone, and a separate referendum on leaving the European Union unless the bloc returns to the &quot;loose federation&quot; it was when West Germany helped found it in 1957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the citadel, dozens of anti-AfD protesters had gathered to oppose Mr Farage's visit. Morag Grant, a British citizen originally from Glasgow, was holding a placard saying &quot;British Berliner against Brexit&quot;. The 44-year-old, who has been living in Berlin for 20 years, was unable to vote in last year's Brexit referendum because she had been an expat in Europe for more than the 15 years threshold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Grant told The Independent Mr Farage was &quot;simply seeking attention&quot;. &quot;It shows that his whole agenda about a claim to British sovereignty is actually about promoting far-right movements and fascist ideology across Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Farage is very good at hiding his own agenda, but he is coming at the heart of Berlin to fuel divisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenny Hackney, 40, who left Manchester for Berlin 16 years ago, said Mr Farage aimed to create &quot;a right-wing avalanche across Europe&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AfD's popularity has taken a hit in recent months after reaching the mid-teens in opinion polls last year. Yet polls have shown the AfD fluctuating between eight and 11 per cent of voting intentions, and the party is expected to enter the Bundestag for the first time in September, after missing out on reaching the national five per cent threshold in the last election. In a poll on Thursday, pollster Infratest dimap found voting intentions for the AfD reached 11 per cent, with many German voters who had not yet made up their minds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITISH charity workers are handing out more than a third of a ton of rice every day to feed the growing numbers of migrants arriving on the outskirts of Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers say they are now serving a daily 3,000 portions of food as a new asylum crisis unfolds on the UK's doorstep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return of refugees to northern France comes less than a year after 10,000 were evicted from the notorious Jungle camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each day a snaking queue of migrants jostle for food prepared from the back of a British-registered van just yards from where the sprawling camp was flattened in October last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While charity workers say they are offering relief to migrants in desperate need of help, critics fear they will attract more people to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MP David Davies warned: &quot;There is a risk that this effort will act as a magnet, drawing people away from properly run refugee camps to risk their lives in order to get to Britain. It's basically a magnet for misery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A French court recently overturned a ban on the distribution of food after local officials claimed it would encourage more refugees to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An aid worker with Refugee Community Kitchen said the charity was now cooking 750lbs of rice each day to cater for a growing army of economic migrants flocking to Calais. This week 300 more arrived by bus from Paris and Germany, swelling numbers already living in woods close to the original Jungle site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they waited for a lunchtime meal of curry, rice and salad, the British woman said: &quot;We are distributing more food than we ever have.&quot; Regional mayor Natacha Bouchart said the creation of &quot;another Jungle&quot; had already started with tents and shelters springing up in woodland and a Medecins du Monde mobile clinic operating in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toilet and shower blocks are also to be installed as French President Emmanuel Macron's new government provides facilities for those looking to sneak into the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials fear it is only a matter of time before the besieged port town is overrun with those hellbent on crossing the Channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is now so bad French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb has increased the amount being offered to Calais migrants to return home from &pound;900 to &pound;2,260.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afghan migrant Arab Saidnazar, 23, has been in Calais for two months waiting for a chance to join his brother who made it to Britain on the back of a lorry and is now working as a cash-in-hand chef in Birmingham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the Daily Express: &quot;Help me, please. Every night I try to get on the back of a truck. I just need one chance. England is a happy place, they speak to refugees there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest official figures show illegals were caught trying to reach Britain as stowaways at a rate of one every 10 minutes last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Office data revealed that on average 4,318 attempts to cross the Channel illegally were made each month in the 13 months to January 2017. The 56,132 total is equal to 139 a day, or six an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing crisis is a concern for thousands of families be using the ferry port and Eurotunnel terminal to return from summer holidays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has already been an alarming spike in violence this summer with British drivers warned not to stop their vehicles near the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night the Home Office said it has invested tens of millions of pounds in new infrastructure to enhance border security, adding: &quot;We continue to work closely with our French counterparts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal that allows refugees, veterans and welfare recipients to challenge government decisions has been burdened by a vast increase to its workload, new figures show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administrative appeals tribunal is an important part of the federal justice system, allowing the most vulnerable to challenge administrative decisions made by federal government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That includes migrants and refugees who have had a visa denied or cancelled, welfare security recipients who have been issued a debt, or veterans who have been ruled ineligible for support. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 6,581 matters were lodged with the AAT in 2014-15, which increased 600% to 41,432 in 2015-16, largely as a result of its amalgamation with several other tribunals. But the increase to its workload continued last financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had 51,426 matters lodged in 2016-17, an increase of 24%. The number of cases finalised and still ongoing also increased by significant amounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One tribunal source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the increase in workload had not been accompanied by increases to resources. The source warned the new caseload, when they reached hearing, would place a significant burden on the tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It usually takes even with accelerated matters, six to nine months to take matters into a hearing,&quot; the source said. &quot;So we haven't had too many of them in hearings before the tribunal yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the flood is coming down the pipeline, as it were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growth is largely driven by migration and refugee cases, which account for 52% of the total cases lodged last financial year and 71% of the matters on hand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Lumsdaine, a solicitor with the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, said delays in the tribunal were worsening and had stretched out beyond six to nine months for a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of the matters for our clients have taken a lot longer than that,&quot; he said. &quot;It is quite variable but it's not unusual for it to take longer than that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like the waiting time has been increasing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeals against national disability insurance scheme decisions have also quadrupled in a year, placing additional weight on Australia's already overloaded administrative appeals tribunal system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Complaints about NSW disability services at highest level in a decade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of appeals against NDIS decisions rose from 46 in 2015-16 to 186 the following year, according to the national disability agency's annual report. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AAT cases largely relate to decisions to deny access or not fund certain support services for people with a disability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in appeals is largely explained by the rapid rise in the number of NDIS participants, from 30,281 in 2015-16 to 90,638 the next year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the number of NDIS participants increases, it is not unreasonable to also expect growth in related activities,&quot; a National Disability Insurance Agency spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These activities include new access and planning decisions, routine scheduled reviews, as well as complaints and/or appeals. As the roll out of the NDIS progresses, the NDIA will continue to put the best outcomes for participants at the core of our decision-making.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NDIS cases are a fraction of the tribunal's workload. But the tribunal source said the NDIA often fails to invest enough resources into running its cases, making them more difficult to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've had a disproportionately large number of [NDIS] appeals to the tribunal,&quot; the source said. &quot;And they show every sign of not coping very well with the influx in applications for support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a number of occasions, to be frank, the NDIA has not adequately resourced themselves for the matters that have come before the tribunal. They've been all over the shop.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">559 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by Swedish nation-wide liberal newspaper Dagens Nyheter website, on 27 November</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition is divided over the Swedish Government's new proposal for refugee children arriving without company. &quot;Finally a proposal in the right direction,&quot; says the Centre Party. &quot;Bad for legal rights,&quot; says the Moderate Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swedish Government will launch talks across the bloc boundary on the new proposal that refugee children arriving without company be allowed a new chance of obtaining residence in Sweden -- but the Government cannot reckon on any solid support. The Moderate Party intends to vote no if the proposal reaches the Riksdag [parliament].</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a bad proposal for a number of different reasons. Partly it is bad for legal rights. This means that it will no longer be grounds for protection that govern migration policy. One will give residence to people who are not refugees,&quot; says Johan Forssell (Moderate Party), spokesperson on migration policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He takes the view that the proposal challenges all confidence in migration policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aside from that, this will make Sweden more attractive to apply for asylum in, once again. This sends a signal that someone who goes underground and does not have grounds for protection can still obtain residence,&quot; Forssell says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the Centre Party welcomes the Government's proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Centre Party has long pushed to have the minors who came here and whom long processing times have afflicted be allowed the chance to stay. We are relieved that the Government is finally putting forward a proposal in this area. We have had to wait a long time for it to come,&quot; says Johanna Jonsson (Centre Party), migration policy spokesperson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centre Party will now analyse the proposal and see whether there are parts of it that can improve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is definitely a proposal in the right direction. Then again, this is perhaps not exactly the path that we would have chosen if we had a majority of our own -- but the probability that we are going to support it in the Riksdag is high,&quot; says Jonsson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberal Party has still not taken a position on whether the party is going to support the proposal in the Riksdag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government is placing a big responsibility on principals and teachers, since they will come to be party to the decisions on people's residence. Today's agreement involves a complicated regulatory framework that is being added to an already severely opaque asylum system. The Liberal Party defends a clear and legally secure asylum system with the focus on every person's need for protection and we must study the proposal in more detail before we take a position on today's proposal,&quot; Fredrik Malm (Liberal Party), migration policy spokesperson, comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sweden Democrats dislike the Government's proposal and are going to vote no when it reaches the Riksdag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In practice, the Government is proposing an option of amnesty. This is a matter of grown-ups without grounds for protection to whom one is prioritizing giving high-school education,&quot; says Paula Bieler (SD), migration policy spokesperson, continuing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If people are fully grown and lack grounds for protection then they should not be allowed to stay in Sweden because they applied for asylum. I would have hoped that the SDP would not give ground to the Green Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After having travelled half the globe and headed numerous German cultural institutions around the world, a retired, dignified German lady sits in her austere dining room, her grey hair lifted in an impeccable bun, and tells me in a disillusioned tone how Germans are usually dry, and how she found in Lebanon a certain quality of life that she missed in Germany. Taken aback by her honesty, I find myself trying to temper her judgment by telling her about some instances where I was treated gently by her fellow citizens. It is no obvious task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Very few Germans are likely to be that lucid about their own culture, though. In fact, the impression one gets when frequenting Germans is that most of them consider their way of life to be inherently superior and their culture to be an absolute reference. This became clear to me after working for two years in German government institutions, where I and other Lebanese colleagues were treated in such a colonialist and inhuman way that would have made Michael Haneke's film </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Das wei&szlig;e Band</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pale in comparison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the more than one million refugees who have entered Germany know what I mean. After Chancellor Angela Merkel adopted an open-door policy towards the refugee wave in 2015, and after the attack on the Berlin Christmas Market last December, anti-immigrant sentiment is on the rise in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pilots stop 222 asylum seekers being deported from Germany by refusing to fly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the last national elections on 24 Sept, Merkel's conservative party paid the price of such openness, and its score dropped significantly (32.9 per cent down from 41.5 per cent), while the anti-immigrant party AfD came in third place, making it the first far-right party to enter the German parliament since the 1960s. With such a low score, Angela Merkel is still struggling to this day to form a ruling coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To justify her generosity, Merkel evoked &quot;a national duty&quot;, and soon the stern accountant-like daughter of a Lutheran pastor became &quot;Mama Merkel&quot; to thousands of refugees. According to some analysts, she is more likely to have been under pressure, from her Nato allies as well as the German heavy industry, which was hoping to benefit from minimal-cost labour. In effect, Germany is in desperate need for skilled workers and for compensating one of the lowest birthrates in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the questionable circumstances which surrounded the entry of more than one million refugees to Germany within two years, the situation cannot be changed, and German society will have to adapt to it. If Germans persist in their anti-immigrant stance, things are bound to deteriorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I've learned from playing the queer Arab villain in a pantomime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a slightly brighter scenario, things would continue as they were before the crisis: immigrants living in their own districts, minding their own business, mostly ignored by native Germans. But this attitude will not work any longer, in the face of such a massive influx of newcomers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, Germans need to abandon the idea of their innate superiority, however fast their Audis and BWMs are. Other cultures are valuable too, and Germans can learn a lot from them, if they show a genuine and humble interest. Curious about his Persian-sounding name and dark features, I once gently asked the director of a German cultural institution in Beirut about his eastern origins. He refused to answer, wryly justifying: &quot;This is a very German question&quot;. Besides the very German answer, would he have been as avoidant, had his name sounded Swedish or Austrian?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This arrogance needs to go, if Germany wants to attract skilled workers. A Lebanese researcher friend who has patented several vaccines in the USA and France told me once how she avoided working with Germans because they &quot;are too square and lack the joys of life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Germans desperately need, apart from filling their factories with cheap workers, is to re-discover notions such as poetry, romance, humour, affection, spontaneity, conversation, sensuality, subtlety, nowadays only to be found in their museums and 18</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">th</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> century literature. But most of all, they need to re-discover the value of human contact. How many times did I try striking up a conversation with a German stranger or offering a small box of chocolates to a German colleague, only to be gratified with a &quot;What do you need from me?&quot; Well, just the joy of human presence. They could learn a lot from the Syrians, Ethiopians and Afghans living next door, eager to talk and offer their neighbours a culinary specialty from their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No need to relinquish one's own culture, or become embittered like the grey-haired lady in her dining room, on this journey of discovery. Being a Christian Lebanese who has learned the hard lesson of the Lebanese war, I have more Muslim friends than Christian ones, and I know more about Islam than some of them. Which doesn't prevent me from staying myself. Such are the joys of dynamic exchange and mixing Germans are in dire need of.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">'More': Karlovy Vary Review</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">674  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tough-themed debut from actor Onur Saylak tackles the issue of refugees through the prism of a father-and-son trafficking operation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Dir. Onur Saylak.&nbsp;Turkey. 2017. 115 min</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his directorial debut, Turkish actor Onur Saylak takes a young boy's coming of age and frames it as a searing morality play. Though touching on themes of sexual exploitation and the ongoing refugee crisis, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">More</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is fundamentally interested in the timeless question of nature versus nurture. Can a bright and sensitive young man, the film asks, ever stand to flourish when every other influence in his life pushes him to become a brute?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c13">The young Van Eck is particularly well cast, equally believable conveying his character's good-hearted innocence and wild-eyed rage later down the line</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adapted from author Hakan G&uuml;nday prize-winning novel of the same name, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">More</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes a hard-nosed approach when answering that central query. Saylak's status as popular TV heartthrob and G&uuml;nday's literary renown should prompt greater curiosity than usual for a first-time film from an unseasoned director, but that publicity will come with a certain cost. Those already familiar with the text will know to expect a narrative that doesn't shy from humanity's ugliest aspects, and that might turn engaged filmgoers into a fairly self-selecting bunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen-year-old Gaza (Hayat Van Eck) lives along the Aegean coast with father Ahad (Ahmet M&uuml;mtaz Taylan) and together they run a grotesquely successful trafficking operation, taking in the seemingly endless supply of refugees and abetting their transit to Europe. The older man does so without a hint of altruism, treating his human cargo as merchandise, keeping them locked in a grimy basement and pimping the women out to earn some extra cash or to satisfy his own impulses. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaza - at least at the film's outset - is not wholly a chip off the old block, and he tries to treat the refugees as humanely as possible while studying for the academic qualifying exam he knows will be his ticket to a better life.&nbsp; Though he too longs to flee, the death of a child under his watch and his growing integration into his father's social circle conspire to keep him in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young Van Eck is particularly well cast, equally believable conveying his character's good-hearted innocence and wild-eyed rage later down the line. Saylak finds inventive visual motifs to mark the young man's induction into a violent adulthood, including a small tattoo on the back of Gaza's neck that expands outward as the film goes on. The script, co-written Saylak and Dogu Yasar Akal, doesn't treat Gaza's final destiny as a fait accompli, creating situations where the audience genuinely doesn't know how the adolescent will react, and in turn, how those reactions will shape his path forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the very refugees are the ones funding Ahad's business, they are essentially paying for their own imprisonment. And because the sheer amount of them allows his business to thrive, Gaza is as much their prisoner as they are his. And though the film navigates this ethical paradox with deft nuance, it depicts a number of instances of sexual and physical violence with blunt force, so much as to cause several walk-outs at the film's first Karlovy Vary screening.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">More</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tackles the ugliness of the world with a beguiling technical package. Cinematographer Feza &Ccedil;aldiran bathes every shot in rich, vibrant colour, and special credit to sound editor Cenker K&ouml;kten's layered soundscapes.&nbsp; Finally, the film makes great use of the Turkish landscape. The region's sweeping mountain vistas and moody blue sea are like characters themselves-perhaps the most appealing ones of all.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the net continues to tighten around Raqqa, the capital of Isis'&quot;caliphate&quot;,thousands of people have been heading for Jordan:refugees desperate to get away from the fighting aretrying to join the 1.3 million Syrians already across the border, in afamiliar tale of thesavage civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Jordanian government has now come to the conclusion that the flow of the dispossessed has been sent in their direction by Isis with the aim of hiding fighters in their midst. There was one deadly attack in the area, at a popular tourist attraction at the end of the year, killing ten people, and there have been repeated recent signs of attempted infiltration by gunmen across the frontier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the movement of the refugees was truly spontaneous and undirected, say the Jordanians, it would be more logical for them to head towards the border with Turkey. Isis, they believe, could be trying to set up a new secret base in and around the Hashemite Kingdom. The US administration, meanwhile, has announced that it is ending a CIA programme for training and arming Syrian rebels which has been taking place in Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan's Syrian refugees scrape by a living</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been presented as another sign of Donald Trump's attempts to please the Russians and final abandonment of any ambition to remove President Basharal-Assad by force. But the soon to be disbanded fighters were not set up to fight the regime, but Isis. It is a role theycould have fulfilled in the current situation with the jihadists gathered at the border, something the Jordanian forces cannot do with King Abdullah's government havingdecided a long while ago not to have boots on the ground inside Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been plenty of criticism of the CIA programme. It was slow, the fighters it trained were few in numbers and accused of not being particularly effective on the ground. Some had even joined extremist groups with their US supplied weapons in the early days. There was also general suspicion of such clandestine missions with echoes of what took place going back to Vietnam and the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan's refugee camp becomes first to run entirely on solar energy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ending of the scheme also smacks of the confusion and contradictions which have markedAmerican policy in Syria.During the US presidential campaign Trump declared he wanted to work with Russia in the country. After getting to the White House he stated that support for the rebels would be ended. But then the new president became the first Western leader to bomb President Assad's forces, giving a surge of hope to the same rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile as one &quot;southern front&quot; is being ended a separate operation is continuing full-throated in the east against Isis with the Kurds and Arab groups deemed as moderate beneficiaries. It is precisely because Isis is getting squeezed in that direction that the displacement is taking place towards the Jordanian border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are heading into an area where a fragile ceasefire - brokered by America, Russia and Jordan - appears to be holding between the regime and rebel groups. The arrival of Isis is bound to have an impact on this delicately balanced scenario with rebel groups unsure about what happens next.One of the commanders, Hassan Hamadeh of Division 101, said about the decision to abandon the CIA scheme : &quot;We are surprised by the news, until now, nothing is confirmed. There have been no changes on the ground, coordination is ongoing, and everything has been happening normally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are worried that the American withdrawal will lead to disillusioned fighters gravitating to the extremists. Adnan Mustapha Mero, of the Omari Brigade, pointed out: &quot;We have had this pattern before. The Western countries encourage people to rise up and fight, then they leave, people are left angry and they are recruited by Daesh (Isis) and [Jabhat] al-Nusra. The Americans don't seem to learn from this pattern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CIA programme may have run its day. But there is a need for another plan to be put in place, working with the Russians if necessary. Otherwise there is the possibility that the West will end up giving Isis, or rather whatever replaces it, a helping hand yet again.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The winner of the 2017 Nobel peace prize will be announced in Oslo on Friday, selected by a panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament from a total of 318 known and reported candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the victor, the names of the nominees are officially kept secret for at least 50 years, but nominators - including former laureates, politicians and academics - often disclose their candidates. False reports are also common. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More or less likely nominations this year - both rumoured and confirmed - include Lions Club International, Julian Assange, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jo Cox, the Bulgarian Orthodox church, David Bowie, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Norway's Peace Research Institute Oslo, which each year draws up a shortlist, and the betting markets have settled on a handful of frontrunners. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Mohammad Javad Zarif and Federica Mogherini                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iranian foreign minister and EU foreign policy chief are seen as strong contenders as orchestrators of the Iran nuclear deal. With tensions mounting between the US and North Korea, the jury could choose to support a landmark effort to restrict nuclear arms development and proliferation now at risk of being torn up by Trump, who has called it an &quot;embarrassment&quot;. John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, was also a key part of negotiations but the Nobel committee could be keen to stress broad international backing for the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   The White Helmets and their leader Raed al Saleh                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decision in favour of the group formally known as the Syrian Civil Defence, nominated several times in recent years, and its remarkable efforts to help civilians in a country torn by six years of war would be a popular award recognising vital humanitarian work and social solidarity in the face of a brutal military onslaught and extreme danger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Can D&uuml;ndar and Cumhuriyet                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now living in self-imposed exile in Germany, D&uuml;ndar was a columnist and editor-in-chief of the secular, republican-leaning Turkish daily, several of whose staff have faced charges of complicity in terrorism for simply doing their jobs. A prize for the editor and his former paper would be a symbolic blow against president Recep Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown on press freedoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   UN high commission for refugees                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN refugee agency has won two Nobel peace prizes in the past but none since 1981, and the jury may feel its work, led by Filippo Grandi during a period of unprecedented global migration and displacement, is worth rewarding. In recent years, the agency has responded to the Syrian civil war, Europe's refugee crisis and Muslim Rohingya fleeing Myanmar. Angela Merkel has reportedly also been nominated for her decision to open Germany's border to more than 1 million refugees and migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Pope Francis                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A favourite with at least one bookmaker this year. No pontiff has ever won the prize but Francis would be widely seen as a popular choice for his strong stance on issues such as refugees, poverty, social justice and climate change. He was nominated this year by a Norwegian member of parliament reportedly because &quot;he is one of the rare ones to stand up to Donald Trump&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   American Civil Liberties Union                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Civil Liberties Union has been particularly active since Trump's inauguration, mounting repeated legal challenges against the US president's more controversial decisions, including his travel ban and ban on transgender military personnel. It has described Trump as &quot;a one-man constitutional crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Raif Badawi                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrested in June 2012 and found guilty of insulting Islam through his website and in TV comments, the Saudi blogger has been sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes. He has received 50 of those, with medical opinion declaring he would be unlikely to survive the remainder. Championed by human rights groups around the world, his victory, after repeated nominations, would be for courage, rationalism and freedom of speech - and an implicit criticism of a brutally repressive regime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the organisation moved into their new premises on Queens Court last month, they have been working hard to deliver a programme of events during July and August in the cafe and other empty units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four men and one woman, from Syria will get involved in the project which aims to promote cultural and creative diversity in Ayr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will join the volunteers who have already got involved with FreshAyr.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Singer, initiator and chairman of the voluntary organisation, explained: &quot;We want to be inclusive and provide as many opportunities as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been working with VASA and SeAscape who have been helping the Syrian refugees who have moved to South Ayrshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FreshAyr will now be working with five refugees to hep them integrate into society, improve their language and make this a project for everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a great way to get them out and about and involved in the community. So far we have four men and one woman getting involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The woman is a tailor and a seamstress and is looking forward to demonstrating her skills and putting them to good use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FreshAyr launched in March 2016 and created a pop up event in November at Watt Brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They then held an event earlier in March this year at Ayr Town Hall which received positive feedback from those who participated, as well as the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert and the team are currently in discussions about becoming involved in the Food and Drinks Festival at the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum on August 26 - 27 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also an ongoing collaborative project with Newton Primary called 'Voice of Children; Change by Design', which will have an interim festival in September in the Church Court area of Wallacetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert continued: &quot;We have kept going. I am always planning the next event as I think it is important to keep the momentum going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to become a permanent part of society and are hoping to take part in the August food festival as well as continue to develop links with Newton Primary School and allow the voice of the children to be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been asking them what they would like to see and they suggested a sweetie shop and a pizza parlour.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a lot of interesting ideas, which they wrote down on paper, and the aim is to create them and make them part of the project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aims of freshAyr are still to create a pipeline for local cultural entrepreneurs and to support creative diversity in Ayrshire, repopulating vacant retail space with a creative hub, adding to quality public space and to encourage a thriving local economy and community.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout August, there will be workshops coming to Queens Court. Alistair Paterson will deliver a talk on sourcing creativity consciousness through creative writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of classes is taking place and those who attend can discover or rediscover their creativity and learn techniques by which we may nurture a life-long relationship to the very font or our creativity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The classes will take place on Thursdays from August 3-31, from 6-8pm.<BR>Aug 3: Intro to Creativity Consciousness<BR>Aug 10: Identifying Obstacles to Creativity and Removing them.<BR>Aug 17: Meeting your Muse - Working from Guided Meditation<BR>Aug 24: Writing a Dialogue with the Creative Self<BR>Aug 31: Learning to become Suggestible in a Suggestive Universe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help with a the project there is a recommended donation of &pound;5 (&pound;3) concessions per session. Booking is recommended but anyone who is interested can come along on a drop-in basis.</SPAN></P>
