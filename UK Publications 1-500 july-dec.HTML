<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of refugees become targets for smugglers in northern France </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the UNHCR is largely positive about the UK's resettlement scheme, it highlights a number of areas for improvement, including in English language provision, and further support for housing and finding work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small number of the refugees interviewed for the study had found work, but the UNHCR said existing work promotion schemes were limited, highlighting the need for further support to refugees on the road to employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other proposals included strengthening the provision of appropriate housing by the central Government, after the study found the stock of affordable rental property was small and diminishing, as well as making family reunification planning more integral.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green Party, said the Governmentwould &quot;no doubt pat itself on the back&quot; for the latest figures, but argued that Britain is still not taking its fair share of Syrian refugees, and &quot;could and should&quot; shelter thousands more people fleeing war and persecution in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are living through the worst refugee crisis on record. As well as resettling refugees from the camps in Syria the Government must do more to help those who have made perilous journeys to get here, especially lone children,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is inexcusable that Ministers have still not fulfilled their promise to take in 450 lone child refugees under the Dubs Scheme. These children are vulnerable to trafficking and abuse and we have a duty to help them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee charities welcomed the high numbers of Syrians who have been brought to the UK as part of the programme, but said more investment is required to ensure refugees have timely access to English language classes so that they can integrate and find work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said: &quot;Brits should feel proud that thousands of families have already been welcomed as part of this programme. But it's essential that refugees resettled here are given the right support to successfully rebuild their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's no surprise UNHCR highlights that support for refugees to learn English must be improved. Our research shows current provision isn't fit for purpose and that refugees can wait up to three years to start learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More investment is needed to ensure all refugees in Britain have timely access to English language classes. Giving refugees the chance to integrate, find jobs and volunteer is a no-brainer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Refugee Council highlighted that while the resettlement scheme has had a &quot;transformative impact&quot;, it remains restricted, with a lack of family reunion options keeping relatives who have been &quot;torn apart by war&quot; unable to live together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maurice Wren, chief executive at the charity, said: &quot;The Refugee Council has first-hand experience of the truly transformative impact that refugee resettlement schemes have on people's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugee resettlement is something the UK does extremely well and we urge the Government to continue doing so, at least current levels and ideally, beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also urge the Government to improve refugee family reunion as a matter of urgency. As it currently stands refugee families are torn apart by war and then kept apart by restrictive UK policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For people who have already experienced untold horrors, this enforced separation is heart-breaking and we urge the Government to change this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summarising the report's findings, Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the UNHCR's representative in London, said the UK &quot;clearly has the capacity to resettle meaningful numbers of refugees&quot;, adding that support for the scheme from the Government, local authorities and the British public has been &quot;striking&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Integration of refugees is complex. By and large it is working, and support for integration - from the public, local authorities and Government - has been striking,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that, with development, this model can help more refugees, from Syria and elsewhere, resettle here after 2020. Our hope is that, building on the success of the VPRS to date, the UK will commit to resettling 10,000 vulnerable refugees a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;The UK is now resettling people on an unprecedented scale and resettled more refugees than any other country in the EU in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over 8,500 people, half of whom are children, have already arrived on the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme and are rebuilding their lives in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recognise that refugees need to be helped to integrate into society and we have put in place significant measures to ensure this can happen. On English language skills specifically, this has included providing &pound;10 million to help local authorities make sure more tuition is available and introducing measures to ensure refugees have access to eight hours' formal tuition a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our mission is more urgent than ever ,&quot; said Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, opening the High Commissioner's 10th Dialogue on Protection Challenges, which focused on the proposed Global Compact for Refugees.<BR><BR>&quot;The exodus from Myanmar into Bangladesh is the most visible, but innocent civilians still flee for their lives in CAR [Central African Republic], the DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo], Iraq, South Sudan, Syria and elsewhere,&quot; he continued.<BR><BR>The meeting, which takes place from 12-13 December, is taking stock of the results of the 2016 New York Declaration - a global deal that committed the UN's 193 Member States to share responsibility for the world's refugees and hosting communities, including by drawing up a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF).<BR><BR>The High Commissioner noted that throughout the world people are still fleeing their homes - victims of a collective failure by the international community to prevent and resolve conflicts.<BR><BR>The global compact should be the instrument to transform [...] commitment into action, so that refugees have a fighting chance to rebuild productive and meaningful lives UN refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi<BR><BR>&quot;The global attention on refugees may wax and wane amidst the vagaries of international politics, but the New York Declaration remains as a high-level political commitment to change the way we respond to refugee crises,&quot; he said.<BR><BR>&quot;The global compact should be the instrument to transform that commitment into action, so that refugees have a fighting chance to rebuild productive and meaningful lives, and contribute to the communities that host them and to their own futures,&quot; stressed Mr. Grandi.<BR><BR>He called for the compact to change how the international community engages with refugee issues, maintaining that &quot;refugees pay the price&quot; of failure, &quot;as do the handful of countries who bear the brunt of hosting refugees without reliable support from others with greater means,&quot; citing closed borders, restricted access and the politicization of refugee movements.<BR><BR>&quot;At a time when multilateralism is faltering in other spheres, the global compact on refugees is our chance to chart a different course through practical engagement and cooperation based on humanitarian values,&quot; he underscored.<BR><BR>Global compact will build on existing framework for refugee protection<BR><BR>Mr. Grandi described the New York Declaration as a milestone, giving refugee situations high political visibility and commitment and an important reaffirmation of fundamental humanitarian values.<BR><BR>He praised the 13 countries that have already started the CRRF rollout, and those who have participated in reviewing key lessons learned, along with experiences from other large-scale refugee situations and welcomed the results of recent pledging conferences.<BR><BR>Some 500 representatives - including from governments, international organisations, local authorities and civil society - from around the world are expected to attend the talks.<BR><BR>The global compact will build on existing international framework for refugee protection, including the 1951 Refugee Convention, and aims to share more equitably the responsibility for hosting the world's refugees and helping them to rebuild their lives.<BR><BR>It will set out concrete steps for governments and others to ensure that refugee-hosting communities get the support they need and that solutions to their plight are sought from the start of a refugee situation.<BR><BR>In February, UNHCR will begin with governments and other stakeholders, formal consultations on the compact, which the High Commissioner will propose to the UN General Assembly towards the end of 2018.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New South Wales regional city of Armidale has volunteered to resettle 200 refugees from Iraq and Syria as part of Australia's humanitarian migration program next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce announced the move - to his electorate - would begin from February next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Armidale is a good fit as a new regional settlement location for humanitarian entrants to Australia,&quot; Joyce said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has a strong, welcoming community demonstrated by the fact that this push for the city to be a settlement location for refugees was driven by the community itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have absolutely no doubt that Armidale will work closely with the refugees settling here to ensure they can take up all the opportunities available to those who choose to embrace the great lifestyle available in regional Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyce said that many of those settling had endured &quot;unimaginable circumstances which have torn families apart&quot; but that Armidale had the necessary services to support them in integrating in their new country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overwhelming majority of migrants to Australia - including those who come as refugees - settle in major cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But refugee resettlement in rural and regional areas has been credited with revitalising country towns socially and economically: in particular places such as Mingoola in northern NSW, which has welcomed three families from Burundi and Congo, and Nhill, which has had more than 160 Karen refugees from Myanmar settle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NSW takes the majority of refugees resettled in Australia, and the bulk of those move to Fairfield City Council in Sydney's west. That council has said it has struggled to cope with the additional influx of people over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NSW co-ordinator general for refugee resettlement Peter Shergold told a resettlement conference in Sydney that efforts to help settle refugees in rural and regional areas would ease pressure on Fairfield and neighbouring Sydney councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said NSW and Australia's refugee intakes were &quot;eminently manageable&quot;. NSW took more than half of the additional intake of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, in addition to its regular refugee resettlement program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees made up a tiny percentage - 0.14% - of population growth in NSW, Shergold said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But refugees don't just distribute across NSW. In this last year, relatively few refugees have gone to Wagga, or Albury or Coffs Harbour, or even to Newcastle or Wollongong. To a very large extent these additional refugees have come to western Sydney... they've come to Fairfield. That's the challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shergold said the issues facing Fairfield City Council were &quot;acute&quot;, and that a broader spread of resettlement would ease pressure in that area, and, critically, assist refugees in finding employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What refugees want is a job. And that has been the most challenging, helping refugees do what they want to do most, which is get employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugees as a whole bring very significant economic skills... they are risk-takers... they are entrepreneurs. When the ABS does its census it finds the group of Australians most likely to set up family business are people who arrived as refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shergold welcomed the Armidale announcement, saying the regional city had the necessary infrastructure and support services already in place to help refuges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This decision has the potential to boost Armidale's local economy, create new business and most of all, become a template for the kind of Australian mateship the world needs to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia's refugee capital 'shows what the country can do'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new migrants will be housed by Settlement Services International, which is contracted by the Department of Social Services. SSI will also help to find jobs for migrants once they settle in the region. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey Goerdt</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">796 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the U.S. unemployment continues to drop to pre-recession levels, the supply of motivated and qualified workers is tightening. Gig economy businesses competing for a shrinking supply of labor may want to consider turning to refugees and asylum seekers to fill their ranks. It turns out that giving gig platforms to resettled refugees and asylum seekers can boost profits and help companies adapt to a globalizing economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new report from the Tent Foundation and the Open Political Economy Network (OPEN) argues that getting refugees to work quickly should be a top priority for communities in which refugees resettle.  Working enables refugees to &quot;contribute to the society that has welcomed them, start paying taxes and end their reliance on welfare - all of which neutralize the claim that they are a burden.&quot;  And it is quite likely that all adult refugees want to work; one survey from the Netherlands found that basically every refugee who had worked in their home country said that getting a job in their new community was &quot;very important&quot; to them. One could presume that a similar survey in the U.S. would yield similar results.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key question is how to harness refugees' desire to become self-sufficient and contribute to their new community's economy. Refugees are an ideal source of human capital for companies in the gig economy. Indeed, the entire premise of the gig economy is to monetize otherwise underutilized capital (think empty second bedrooms now filled up thanks to AirBnB, and car owners renting rarely used cars to their neighbors on Turo). When they arrive in the U.S., refugees typically have time on their hands and a desire to work, but few job prospects. They are, in other words, underutilized human capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies in the gig economy are increasingly offering opportunities to refugees in the U.S. and across the world. While many of the gig economy's marquee names have announced ambitious plans to provide assistance to refugees, other companies in the gig economy have found ways to offer refugees a way to earn a living in positions ranging from manual labor to tech work. For instance, the startup Dwell currently employs refugees from eight countries to clean homes in the Atlanta area. Language and cultural training service Chatterbox aims to take advantage of refugees' foreign language skills by offering a platform for refugees to tutor people interested in learning a new language. Targeting a higher-tech niche, San Francisco-based Harmoni is building a mobile app that will allow refugees to do gig work from a smartphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retaining refugees can benefit gig businesses in at least two ways: loyalty and tax credits. Whether working for themselves in the gig economy or as employees in the traditional economy, refugees tend to be loyal workers. As every hiring manager knows, employee loyalty has tangible benefits. Take, for example, Denver shipping pallet manufacturer L&amp;R Pallet. When the company began hiring refugees in 2013, its annual staff turnover was 300% (the company's average employee worked there for just four months). By 2017, its turnover rate had plummeted to 15%. Of its 130 employees, 85 are now refugees. Not only does the company spend less time and money on recruiting and training now, its profits have increased, and its product quality has improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gig businesses that  treat workers as employees rather than independent contractors may also be eligible for significant tax credits. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) can provide employers up to $2,400 per new refugee hired. This tax credit can help offset the up-front costs associated with recruiting and training refugees. A report from the Boston Consulting Group found that those initial costs, while roughly 40% higher than for non-refugees, are offset in most instances within one year due to added earnings and government subsidies like the WOTC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees are an underutilized but key part of this country's labor market. ZipCar founder Robin Chase has observed that when companies &quot;tap directly into the full diversity and energy of their human marketplaces, [they] are able to scale faster, learn faster, innovate and adapt faster.&quot; Despite the recent decline in refugee admissions to the United States, companies in the gig economy and the economy at large are learning that working with and hiring refugees is not only a &quot;good thing&quot; to do, but it's also good for the bottom line.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Ellie Cullen, Press Association</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 8,000 refugees have arrived in the UK and been given access to life-saving medical treatment, education and safe accommodation under the Government's Syrian resettlement scheme, a report from the United Nations has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, ministers committed to taking in 20,000 Syrians driven from the war-torn country by 2020, following a public outcry over the fate of those attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has now conducted a study, alongside the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and City University London, to monitor how those who have already arrived in the UK have integrated into their new country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 167 refugees from the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) were interviewed as part of the report, more than half of whom were previously refugees in Lebanon, with the remainder travelling from Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report found that the programme was working ``relatively well'', and said that refugees ``were grateful for the genuine welcome they had received''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as being ``heartened'' that their children could attend school and catch up on lost education, the refugees reported feeling safe in their homes and neighbourhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study also said the VPRS had played a ``key role'' in securing life-saving medical support for many resettled Syrians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the report highlighted a number of areas for improvement, including in English language provision, and further support for housing and gaining employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the UNHCR's representative in London, said: ``The UK clearly has the capacity to resettle meaningful numbers of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Integration of refugees is complex. By and large it is working, and support for integration - from the public, local authorities and Government - has been striking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We hope that, with development, this model can help more refugees, from Syria and elsewhere, resettle here after 2020.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UHNCR urged the UK Government to consider adopting a national UK refugee integration strategy, to create a clear vision of how to integrate refugees and to better inform and guide those supporting refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report stated that while a small number of those interviewed had gained employment, existing work promotion schemes were limited, highlighting the the need for further support to refugees on the road to employment. Some councils felt they would benefit from a national plan for employers and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other proposals included strengthening the provision of appropriate housing by the central Government, after the study found the stock of affordable rental property was small and diminishing, as well as making family reunification planning more integral in the VPRS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Vargas Llosa added: ``Our hope is that, building on the success of the VPRS to date, the UK will commit to resettling 10,000 vulnerable refugees a year.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advisory: First issued under embargo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesman said: ``The UK is now resettling people on an unprecedented scale and resettled more refugees than any other country in the EU in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Over 8,500 people, half of whom are children, have already arrived on the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme and are rebuilding their lives in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We recognise that refugees need to be helped to integrate into society and we have put in place significant measures to ensure this can happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``On English language skills specifically, this has included providing &pound;10 million to help local authorities make sure more tuition is available and introducing measures to ensure refugees have access to eight hours' formal tuition a week.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advisory: First issued under embargo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Hale, chief executive of the charity Refugee Action, said it was ``essential'' that resettled refugees were given the right support to rebuild their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: ``It's no surprise UNHCR highlights that support for refugees to learn English must be improved. Our research shows current provision isn't fit for purpose and that refugees can wait up to three years to start learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``More investment is needed to ensure all refugees in Britain have timely access to English language classes. Giving refugees the chance to integrate, find jobs and volunteer is a no-brainer.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, Talent displaced: The economic lives of Syrian refugees in Europe, is the result of a survey of 305 Syrian refugees in Austria, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as qualitative interviews with businesses in these countries. The survey and interviews were conducted from March to June 2017, and is the result of a collaboration between Deloitte and the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford (RSC). It aims to contribute to the conversation on the major challenges facing refugees as they seek employment. Understanding these challenges can help businesses, government, and NGOs better target the assistance they provide to refugees in Europe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Educated and skilled, but unemployed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey presents a paradox: a significant number of refugees surveyed are highly educated and skilled; 38% have university education, and one-third were employed in either skilled work or the professional services industry in Syria. However, the majority of the respondents  82%  were unemployed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major barriers to employment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Language was one of the greatest barriers to employment, with 84% of refugees surveyed reporting that speaking the local language is the biggest barrier to access employment. Another key barrier related to skills: 63% of the refugees surveyed say they preferred to work in jobs that were linked to their existing skills and previous employment experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the businesses interviewed were open to the idea of hiring refugees, but seek legal and regulatory guidance around employing refugees. Additionally, many had misconceptions relating to their potential as prospective employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Syrian refugees in Europe often have skills and talents. And yet they are likely to be unemployed. We have collaborated with Deloitte to explain this paradox and identify practical solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander Betts, Professor of Forced Migration and International Affairs and former Director of the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This work is part of our ongoing commitment to impacting people's lives through education, skills, and providing access to opportunity. The report aims to help fill in knowledge gaps about the economic potential, skills, and talents of Syrian refugees in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through this initiative we are helping to identify and address challenges refugees face as they seek work and become part of their communities, while also showing how refugees are positive contributors to their new society. The more we can do to inform public opinion, policy, and actions, the more people and communities we can help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacques Buith, Deloitte Northwest Europe senior partner and global lead client service partner for the United Nations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bridging the gap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report findings suggest a number of practical implications to better support the economic ambitions of refugees. As the report suggests, Syrian refugees in Europe have skills, talents, and aspirations. From closing the language training gap to exploring labor market matching platforms and recognizing technology as an opportunity, business, government, civil society  and refugees themselves  all have an important role to play in enhancing the economic participation of refugees in their host countries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government's flagship refugee programme is under fire for failing to accommodate the most vulnerable people fleeing the Syrian war. Exclusive figures obtained by The Independent show that just 5 per cent of refugees resettled under the scheme have disabilities, such as mobility issues or special educational needs, despite estimates that more than one in five people escaping from the war are disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour said the findings marked an &quot;all new low&quot; for the Government, claiming that the Home Office's treatment of refugees contradicted British values. Local council workers complained that central government was taking a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to refugee placement, with little consideration of how to accommodate complex needs. Meanwhile, councils were accused of providing &quot;shopping lists&quot; of the kinds of families they wanted that excluded the most at-risk groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures released by 251 councils under freedom of information laws show that 5,529 Syrian refugees were resettled under the Vulnerable Persons Relocation Programme (VPRP) between January 2014 and April this year. Of those 288, or 5.2 per cent, were registered as disabled. Yet the World Health Organisation calculates that 15 per cent of people worldwide have a disability - and the proportion is higher among those fleeing conflict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Handicap International estimates around 22 per cent of Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan have serious impairments. The organisation found that 80 per cent of significant injuries were a result of the Syrian war. Those not resettled in Britain and other European countries remain in camps and makeshift shelters in Syria's neighbour states, including Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq and Turkey, where UN human rights experts warn disabled refugees face inadequate access to essential services and medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The VPRP - which commits the Government to taking in 20,000 refugees by 2020 - was set up in 2014 primarily to accommodate the most at-risk groups, including the elderly, the disabled and victims of sexual violence and torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revelations about how many disabled refugees the UK accepted came after The Independent in February reported that the Government had temporarily barred disabled child refugees from a different scheme because it could not cope with their needs. Labour-led councils in the UK took 69 per cent more disabled refugees per capita than Conservative ones, analysis revealed. The gap widened to 82 per cent when it came to the overall number of Syrians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, SNP-led councils took almost five times as many refugees with disabilities per capita as Conservative ones, housing 19 for every million people, compared to the Tories' four, analysis showed. The Independent has based its calculations only on upper tier authorities that provided full figures. Around half (48 per cent) of the 288 disabled refugees the UK resettled were accepted by just 10 councils. Coventry took 23 people with mobility issues or special education needs - the most of any local authority - closely followed by Glasgow and Nottingham, which took 20 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louise Calvey, head of resettlement at Refugee Action, said an area's politics was &quot;a seismic factor&quot; in determining whether a council would participate in the refugee scheme. She added that some councils were daunted by the prospect of accepting responsibility for people with disabilities. &quot;When you [resettle] someone with a high level of additional needs it can be frightening. I think a lot of people are quite nervous about committing to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some areas, Ms Calvey said, a severely limited amount of accessible housing meant even councils that were willing to re-home disabled refugees could not. &quot;They can't magic houses up, they can't suddenly develop a whole list of bungalows that wheelchair users can access easily,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulties finding housing for disabled refugees were &quot;no different from the barriers those born in the UK who have physical disabilities face,&quot; she added. Recent welfare reforms, including the benefits cap, have made it even harder to accommodate people with complex needs, she claimed. &quot;You've already got people being resettled into poverty, which makes me shudder,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jazz Shaban, co-chair of Bicester Refugee Support in Oxfordshire, said local authorities were allowed to choose the kind of family they resettled, meaning some councils avoided helping those with the highest level of need. &quot;Local authorities have a shopping list of the sort of family they want,&quot; she said. &quot;Generally they're not asking for people with complex needs. The words I've heard used are a 'steady family'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only was there variation between councils, but there were large differences in regional responses to refugees with disabilities. Scotland resettled almost four times the number of disabled refugees per capita than England. The north-east of England took more than eight times the number of disabled refugees per head than London. Parts of the country that voted for Brexit were less likely to take disabled refugees than those who opted to remain in the EU. Pro-remain areas accepted 44 per cent more disabled Syrian refugees per capita than Eurosceptic ones. For total Syrian refugees the difference was 43 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Barnett, from Coventry Council, criticised the Government for not doing enough to support disabled refugees. &quot;We are not helped by the one-size fits all nature of the Home Office programmes, which do not really address the additional support required by people living with disabilities,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott pointed to cases where central government failed to take up offers from local councils to house refugees. Responding to the figures, she said: &quot;This is truly appalling and an all new low in this Government's treatment of refugees, discriminating against the disabled. Just over a year ago when Theresa May made her first speech as Prime Minister she said 'a disability or a health condition should never dictate the path a person is able to take'. But this has clearly been a factor blocking the legitimate right of vulnerable refugees to seek asylum in this country. This Government's treatment of refugees is simply not in line with British values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melanie Ward, Associate Director of Policy and Advocacy at the International Rescue Committee said the UK's pledge to resettle refugees made specific reference to supporting disabled Syrians. She said it was &quot;disappointing&quot; that the UK had not fulfilled its goal of catering for the most vulnerable refugees. &quot;At a time where we are pushing European countries to expand their resettlement programmes, particular attention should be paid to ensuring the needs of disabled refugees are met,&quot; she added. &quot;It is vital that the UK recognises that disabled refugees are often among the most vulnerable, and are exactly those which resettlement seeks to protect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, said &quot;much more needs to be done&quot; to cater for the most vulnerable refugees. &quot;Reception and integration support is key to successful resettlement through ensuring that resettled refugees are properly received and have the support and services they need to integrate into their new society and live fulfilled lives,&quot; a spokesperson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office said the findings were &quot;inaccurate&quot; but was unable to provide numbers that contradicted The Independent's figures. A spokesperson added: &quot;Almost a third of the families who have arrived include at least one person with either mobility issues, a serious medical condition, psychological problems or special educational needs. Given the hardships that they have faced, the reality is that the refugee families we resettle are all vulnerable, for a number of different reasons. How we place each family is carefully considered on a case by case basis - in collaboration with local authorities and the UNHCR - taking into account all relevant information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees with disabilities in countries surrounding Syria live in particularly poor conditions, since they struggle to access healthcare and other support, human rights organisations have reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One disabled Syrian man The Independent spoke to was stranded in Lebanon with little access to medical care for two years. Hussein Ejrf, who was eventually resettled in the UK in November 2015, suffered catastrophic injuries when his dairy farm was shelled by both government and opposition forces in Quneitra, south-west Syria. When the 41-year-old father of four arrived in Lebanon he could not afford the surgery or medicine he needed. Eventually, his left leg had to be amputated, a procedure he believes would not have been necessary if he had been treated properly. &quot;It was a tragedy living in Lebanon,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On when one occasion when Mr Ejrf was in intensive care, his wife Hayat searched for three days for someone with a matching blood type. When she eventually found a donor, doctors refused to administer the blood until they paid $100 (&pound;76), Mr Ejrf said. They did not have the money, and Ms Ejrf had to beg strangers for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ejrf now lives in Coventry with his wife and their four children. He visits the GP every month and gets the medication he needs. When he first arrived in the UK, he wanted to get a driving licence, but now he says he is &quot;thrilled&quot; with his electric wheelchair.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence continues to mar the forced relocation of refugees out of the Manus Island detention centre, with three men attacked - two with machetes - in separate robberies on the island at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 27-year-old Sudanese refugee had his leg cut with a bush knife when men broke into a guesthouse he was staying in in the main Manus township of Lorengau on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unrelated incident, an Iranian asylum seeker had his wrist badly cut when he was attacked and robbed in the street in the early hours of Sunday morning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island closure: refugees forced out of compound and threatened with arrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pictures of the man's injuries - showing a deep wound and significant blood loss - were circulated on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They turned him over and cut open his veins,&quot; one refugee said. &quot;It was like revenge; like they wanted him dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And later on Sunday, an Afghan refugee was attacked as he walked on the street near the hospital and had his wallet and phone stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men attacked with knives have been treated at Lorengau's small hospital but will probably require more specialist attention in Port Moresby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks are likely to increase resistance among asylum seekers and refugees to being forcibly moved from the closing Manus Island detention centre to a new &quot;refugee transit centre&quot; built by Australia on the outskirts of Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Papua New Guinean and Australian governments are committed to closing the Australian-run centre - ruled illegal by PNG's supreme court 16 months ago - by the end of October. The dismantling of the compounds has begun even before men have moved out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some refugees have been left living in buildings without power or running water, and threatened they will be arrested if they refuse to move to a compound Australia has built near the township of East Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have been told their chances to be resettled in the US - which many believe are remote and fading - will be jeopardised if they don't agree to relocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical, catering, educational and recreational facilities have begun to be shuttered. Bulldozers and cranes have been moved in - including at night - to begin demolishing buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter from PNG's immigration authority on Monday announced that all power and water to Foxtrot compound would be cut imminently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani told Guardian Australia: &quot;The Australian Border Force and PNG immigration cut the power and water in Foxtrot which is the largest compound in Manus prison camp. According to their plan, they want to first close Foxtrot then close other compounds to force people to go to the transit centre which is close to the local Lorengau community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About 100 refugees are living in Foxtrot and at this moment there is not any place for them to live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pressure is increasing inside the prison camp, and on the other side the attacks on the refugees in Lorengau town are increasing. The ABF plan is to put pressure on both sides to force the refugees to go back to their countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions have been steadily building between the refugees on Manus - all single men - and locals in the small township of Lorengau. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of consensual relationships have begun between refugees and Manusian women. There have also been allegations of sexual offences by refugees and asylum seekers, including against children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is resentment too, of apparent advantages given to refugees and asylum seekers, including around accommodation and allowances for food and cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manus, the smallest province in PNG and distant north, is underdeveloped and routinely ignored by the Port Moresby-centric national government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australian government pays heavy penalty for Manus mistreatment | Richard Ackland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani told Guardian Australia refugees did not feel safe being forcibly relocated to Lorengau. &quot;It's a chain of attacks and, unfortunately, the local police cannot protect the refugees,&quot; he said. &quot;This kind of incidents are commonly happens in Lorengau town for refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said there was no viable solution for refugees and asylum seekers in PNG, and those illegally held on Manus - most for four years - should be brought to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The moves to meet the arbitrary October deadline for closure is literally putting refugees' lives at risk,&quot; he said. &quot;Not only are refugees vulnerable to attack, there is no adequate medical treatment and insufficient food for those forced into East Lorengau.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month the Australian government agreed to pay $70m in compensation to 1,905 men held on Manus for their illegal detention and the physical and psychological damage their incarceration had caused, but without admitting liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of France's biggest pop artists, Christine and the Queens is calling for urgent attention and action for refugees fleeing violence in the Democratic of Congo, as concern rises over the number of displaced people fleeing conflict and violence in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travelling with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, Christine visited refugee settlements in neighbouring Uganda where, during a trip earlier this month to the country's southwest, she witnessed over 350 refugees arriving from the DRC in a single day, with numbers rising daily.<BR><BR>Since 2012 some 236,500 Congolese refugees have fled to Uganda. In all 621,711 refugees from the DRC now live in more than eleven African countries, with Uganda hosting the largest number.<BR><BR>Commenting on the crisis, Christine said, &quot;I want to do what I can to humbly show solidarity with refugees and shine a light on forgotten emergencies like this one. Because newsfeeds are already so saturated with information, some of the tragic refugee crises of our time don't get the coverage they urgently need. I feel it's my obligation, as an artist and citizen, to use my voice to ensure their stories and needs reach even further.<BR><BR>During her visit, Christine spent time at the Rwamwanja Youth Centre, supported by UNHCR. The center holds music workshops in which young Congolese refugees can harness the talents, play music and make friends. &quot;It's easy to forget numbers but you can't forget faces,&quot; she continued, &quot;I for sure won't be able to forget the faces of the refugees I have met here in Uganda. It's uplifting to see a safe space for young refugees to play music, dance and be young again in the middle of an emergency zone like this,&quot; Christine commented, &quot;This kind of project allows gifted teenagers to spend a few hours losing themselves in the music they love before they go back to the reality of the challenges of refugee life.&quot;<BR><BR>UNHCR is increasingly concerned by the escalating displacement in several key regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With widespread militia activities, unrest and violence affecting many areas, the risk of further displacement is high and getting aid to people in need is increasingly challenging.<BR><BR>Bornwell Kantande, UNHCR's Representative in Uganda noted, &quot;Uganda is currently hosting over 1.4 million refugees from neighbouring South Sudan, DR Congo, Burundi and other countries,&quot; Kantande continued. &quot;UNHCR is working together with the Government of Uganda to provide humanitarian assistance to the newly arriving refugees and help them become self-reliant as quickly as possible.&quot;<BR><BR>Kantande went on to add &quot;In line with the CRRF, Uganda is strengthening refugee protection by providing integrated services to both refugees and host communities including in health, education and job opportunities. This approach enhances refugees' self-reliance and fosters stronger bonds between local communities and refugees. The CRRF also brings more partners together, especially development experts, to bring long term solutions to the refugee situation and provide additional support to the Government so it can include refugees in national development plans&quot;<BR><BR>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 8,000 refugees have arrived in the UK and been given access to life-saving medical treatment, education and safe accommodation under the Government's Syrian resettlement scheme, a report from the United Nations has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, ministers committed to taking in 20,000 Syrians driven from the war-torn country by 2020, following a public outcry over the fate of those attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has now conducted a study, alongside the International Organisation for Migration and City University London, to monitor how those who have already arrived in the UK have integrated into their new country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     UK Syria refugee programme working 'by and large' as over 8,000 arrive: UN study twitter 1                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 167 refugees from the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) were interviewed as part of the report, more than half of whom were previously refugees in Lebanon, with the remainder travelling from Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report found that the programme was working &quot;relatively well&quot;, and said that refugees &quot;were grateful for the genuine welcome they had received&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as being &quot;heartened&quot; that their children could attend school and catch up on lost education, the refugees reported feeling safe in their homes and neighbourhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     UK Syria refugee programme working 'by and large' as over 8,000 arrive: UN study twitter 2                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study also said the VPRS had played a &quot;key role&quot; in securing life-saving medical support for many resettled Syrians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the report highlighted a number of areas for improvement, including in English language provision, and further support for housing and gaining employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the UNHCR's representative in London, said: &quot;The UK clearly has the capacity to resettle meaningful numbers of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Integration of refugees is complex. By and large it is working, and support for integration - from the public, local authorities and Government - has been striking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     UK Syria refugee programme working 'by and large' as over 8,000 arrive: UN study twitter 3                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that, with development, this model can help more refugees, from Syria and elsewhere, resettle here after 2020.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR urged the UK Government to consider adopting a national UK refugee integration strategy, to create a clear vision of how to integrate refugees and to better inform and guide those supporting refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report stated that while a small number of those interviewed had gained employment, existing work promotion schemes were limited, highlighting the need for further support to refugees on the road to employment. Some councils felt they would benefit from a national plan for employers and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other proposals included strengthening the provision of appropriate housing by the central Government, after the study found the stock of affordable rental property was small and diminishing, as well as making family reunification planning more integral in the VPRS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Vargas Llosa added: &quot;Our hope is that, building on the success of the VPRS to date, the UK will commit to resettling 10,000 vulnerable refugees a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US President Donald Trump only wants refugees to enter the country who have a chance of &quot;successful assimilation,&quot; a move that one relief organisation said sets up &quot;arbitrary obstacles&quot; for those fleeing violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persecution for race, religion, political affiliation, or nationality could no longer be enough for entry into the US according to a proposal to Congress, obtained by Vice News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, leaked by a Capitol Hill staff memberto the news outlet, stated that one more criterion to consider granting refugee status be &quot;a refugee's likelihood of successful assimilation and contribution in the US&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump proposes cutting refugee cap to historic low of 45,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has said the proposal places &quot;arbitrary obstacles designed to make safety and stability unattainable for the most vulnerable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the US has traditionally helped refugees learn or improve English language skills and provides job training and placement programmes, demonstrating the ability to assimilate into American life on an application has never been required, according to the member of the Capitol Hill staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a significant change,&quot; the staffer, not authorised to speak on the record about the matter, said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> request for comment as yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal does not define what &quot;criteria&quot; for &quot;successful assimilation&quot; could be demonstrated on a successful application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead the Trump administration cited the US Office of Refugee Resettlement's Annual Survey of Refugees which states &quot;noticeable gains in English language proficiency and workforce participation, and decreased reliance on public benefits&quot; as signs of assimilation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the study is conducted </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;refugees fleeing persecution and violence have entered the US and been resettled here not during the application process or before services are provided by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 70-page proposal also indicates the administration wants authorities to conduct &quot;social media checks&quot; on applicants, but does not indicate if that could be a way to demonstrate the ability to successfully assimilate or a way to reject applications for security concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aside from lacking a moral justification, the Administration does not offer any evidence for the need of an assimilation test,&quot; the IRC said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IRC said refugees actually have a &quot;fast&quot; rate of integration into their new American communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US was home to more than 180,000 refugee entrepreneurs, 13 per cent of the refugee population in 2015.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee athletics team take London</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only nine per cent of the US born population are entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees also &quot;begin to learn English right away: 54 per cent of refugees speak English &quot;very well or exclusively&quot; within 5 to 16 years of arrival,&quot; according to IRC-cited research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US also just decreased the number of refugees it would accept to its lowest since 1980. A maximum of 45,000 refugees will be taken in during the coming fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration wanted 110,000 refugees to be allowed to enter the US in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drastically lower cap was announced to media even before Congress had seen the proposal, a move heavily criticised by both Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican Chuck Grassley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also comes during what the United Nations has called the most dire refugee crisis the world has ever seen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Tanzanian newspaper The Guardian website on 18 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has requested the Tanzanian government not to try to force Burundian refugees to go home, but allow them to return to their country of origin of their own free will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plea comes barely a month after President [John] Magufuli ordered Burundi refugees to go home, saying the political and security situation in the troubled neighbouring country had stabilised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just as everyone has a right to flee, everyone has a right to return. It's however essential that it is the free choice of refugees to return, and that they understand clearly the situation in the place they return to,&quot; UNHCR's assistant high commissioner for protection, Volker Turk, said in a statement yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that many refugees may not be willing or able to return to Burundi, and thus should continue to be afforded the protection they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of the UN refugee agency and the Tanzanian government last week held a high-level dialogue in Dar es Salaam underlining key principles for the protection of asylum seekers and refugees as well as further joint actions to be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegations to the meeting were headed by Home Affairs Minister Mwigulu Nchemba on the government side, and Turk for the UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As some refugees have expressed the wish to return to Burundi, UNHCR and ... Tanzania also emphasised the need to ensure the voluntary nature of such returns and that all safeguards for protection are met,&quot; the UNHCR statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking ahead, UNHCR and the government...set out further steps to take, including a review of the country's refugee policy to ensure that it is adapted to the current refugee situation and that its procedures allows for quick identification of those with protection needs,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government and the UN agency also agreed on the need to address gaps and pursue opportunities to better support refugees and host communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement also noted that Tanzania remains the largest host of Burundian refugees in the region. The country currently hosts approximately 350,000 refugees and asylum seekers, most of them from Burundi, according to UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women and children make up 78 per cent of the total (Burundi) refugee population. It has also granted naturalisation to more than 162,000 Burundian refugees who fled in 1972,&quot; said UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said UNHCR and the government also agreed on the importance of re-doubling efforts to finalise the naturalisation process for the remaining 1972 Burundi refugees, assist refugees who wish to voluntarily return to their countries of origin, and advocate for resettlement to third countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A technical tripartite meeting to initiate discussions on the return of Burundi refugees to their native country is scheduled to take place at the end of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Magufuli announced last month in Kigoma Region that he has ordered the suspension of any more citizenship issuance procedures for Burundian refugees, and urged the asylum seekers to go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not that I am expelling Burundian refugees...I am only advising them to voluntarily return home,&quot; Magufuli said after the visiting Burundi president Pierre Nkurunziza assured him that peace was restored to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkurunziza also called on Burundians seeking asylum in Tanzania to go home and help rebuild their nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to government records, over 150,000 out of close to 250,000 Burundian refugees in Tanzania have voluntarily returned to their country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warning of threats to the global asylum environment, the United Nations refugee agency's protection chief today stressed the importance of sustained engagement by the international community to keep refugees high on the political agenda.<BR><BR>&quot;The interest in refugee and displacement-related issues tends to wax and wane. We are already seeing a different dynamic today than in 2015, when refugees were foremost on the political agenda,&quot; Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Volker T&uuml;rk said in a key address to the annual Executive Committee meeting of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sustained engagement is required, especially to address protracted refugee and internal displacement situations, but also new large movements of refugees and migrants,&quot; he added, stressing that every nation must exercise its responsibility towards all people - nationals and non-nationals alike - who are subject to the jurisdiction of a country.<BR><BR>&quot;Providing protection and hope for the future does not take anything away; if properly managed, it adds and enriches,&quot; Mr. T&uuml;rk explained, adding: &quot;Sometimes this gets forgotten in the media chatter and myopic political discourse where abstract concepts and ideologies obscure the realities of human beings in distress.&quot;<BR><BR>He added that: &quot;Asylum and refugee protection are not things thrown easily to the wind. They represent humanity at its best, and respect for each human being.&quot; In this regard, next year's Global Compact on Refugees will help to sustain this much-needed interest, he said, referring to an internationally agreed document on the refugee issues to be adopted by UN Member States in 2018. He said the proposed compact would broaden support base by building new and reinforcing old partnerships, such as with the World Bank, regional bodies, civil society, and the private sector, and encourage much stronger commitments to resettlement and complementary pathways. The compact would also enable greater predictability and investment in the future by strengthening the resilience of both refugees and hosting communities. &quot;This is a tall order, but it is achievable if we work on it together,&quot; he told representatives of 151 States that make up the Executive Committee. On international protection, Mr. T&uuml;rk said violations of international refugee law are &quot;wide-ranging and occur in all parts of the world.&quot; &quot;In particular, they have included killings of refugees by the military,&quot; he said, adding that there has also been a surge in serious incidents of refoulement, the forced return of refugees. The essence of international protection lies in identifying and recognizing the needs of people fleeing conflict, violence, human rights abuses, and other serious predicaments in their country of origin<BR><BR>Another major worry is an increasing trend in deterrence measures by governments. Prolonged, arbitrary, and indefinite detention of asylum-seekers and refugees continues in a number of countries, including in so-called 'regional processing centres,' he said.<BR><BR>&quot;Granting asylum and protecting refugees is a humanitarian, non-political act,&quot; he said, stressing that some politicians have cast aside humanity in favour of short-term political gains, arguing that they were acting in defence of the liberty, security, and safety of their citizenry. &quot;This is dangerous - not just for the many refugees whose lives are affected as a result, but also for the citizens in whose defence governments purport to act,&quot; he said. A variety of terms are used to describe refugees, such as &quot;undocumented people&quot; or &quot;vulnerable migrants,&quot; possibly with the idea of making a stronger case for the rights of all people on the move. However, this has caused confusion and inadvertently provided fodder for those who wish to undermine refugees' rights. &quot;I have to say that, quite apart from the erroneous legal depiction, I find it inappropriate to present people as a sub-set of anything, migrants or otherwise,&quot; he said. &quot;A refugee is a refugee,&quot; he continued, explaining that there is a clear legal definition of refugees linked to absence of national protection. The essence of international protection lies in identifying and recognizing the needs of people fleeing conflict, violence, human rights abuses, and other serious predicaments in their country of origin, Mr. T&uuml;rk added.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures released by 251 councils under freedom of information laws show that 5,529 Syrian refugees were resettled under the Vulnerable Persons Relocation Programme (VPRP) between January 2014 and April this year.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louise Calvey, head of resettlement at Refugee Action, said an area's politics was &quot;a seismic factor&quot; in determining whether a council would participate in the refugee scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that some councils were daunted by the prospect of accepting responsibility for people with disabilities. &quot;When you [resettle] someone with a high level of additional needs it can be frightening. I think a lot of people are quite nervous about committing to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some areas, Ms Calvey said, a severely limited amount of accessible housing meant even councils that were willing to re-home disabled refugees could not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulties finding housing for disabled refugees were &quot;no different from the barriers thoseborn inthe UK who have physical disabilitiesface,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent welfare reforms, including the benefits cap, have made it even harder to accommodate people with complex needs, she claimed. &quot;You've already got people being resettled into poverty, which makes me shudder,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jazz Shaban, co-chair of Bicester Refugee Support in Oxfordshire, said local authorities were allowed to choose the kind of family they resettled, meaning some councils avoided helping those with the highest level of need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local authorities have a shopping list of the sort of family they want,&quot; she said. &quot;Generally they're not asking for people with complex needs. The words I've heard used are a 'steady family'.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Barnett, from Coventry Council, criticised the Government for not doing enough to support disabled refugees. &quot;We are not helped by the one-size fits all nature of the Home Office programmes, which do not really address the additional support required by people living with disabilities,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott pointed to cases where central government failed to take up offers from local councils to house refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the figures, she said: &quot;This is truly appalling and an all new low in this Government's treatment of refugees, discriminating against the disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just over a year ago when Theresa May made her first speech as Prime Minister she said 'a disability or a health condition should never dictate the path a person is able to take'.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melanie Ward, Associate Director of Policy and Advocacy at the International Rescue Committee said the UK's pledge to resettle refugees made specific reference to supporting disabled Syrians. She said it was &quot;disappointing&quot; that the UK had not fulfilled its goal of catering for the most vulnerable refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a time where we are pushing European countries to expand their resettlement programmes, particular attention should be paid to ensuring the needs of disabled refugees are met,&quot; she added. &quot;It is vital that the UK recognises that disabled refugees are often among the most vulnerable, and are exactly those which resettlement seeks to protect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, said &quot;much more needs to be done&quot; to cater for the most vulnerable refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reception and integration support is key to successful resettlement through ensuring that resettled refugees are properly received and have the support and services they need to integrate into their new society and live fulfilled lives,&quot; a spokesperson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office said the findings were &quot;inaccurate&quot; but was unable to providenumbers that contradicted </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson added: &quot;Almost a third of the families who have arrived include at least one person with either mobility issues, a serious medical condition, psychological problems or special educational needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the hardships that they have faced, the reality is that the refugee families we resettle are all vulnerable, for a number of different reasons. How we place each family is carefully considered on a case by case basis - in collaboration with local authorities and the UNHCR - taking into account all relevant information.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the 41-year-old father of four arrived in Lebanon he could not afford the surgery or medicine he needed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has been urged to pressure its refugee resettlement partner Cambodia to halt the &quot;imminent return&quot; of 29 Montagnard refugees back to Vietnam where they face violent persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-nine refugees from the ethnic and religious minority face deportation back to Vietnam, despite the UN's refugee agency offering to take the group out of Cambodia, and offer them protection while a permanent third-country resettlement is found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia - as a refugee resettlement partner with Cambodia - has been urged to use its influence with the country's government to stop the deportations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked on Wednesday about Cambodia's treatment of refugees in its territory, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull defended his government's Cambodia arrangement for resettling refugees from the Australian-run offshore detention islands in the southeast Asian country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Four refugees detained by Australia on Nauru volunteer to resettle in Cambodia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-nine of a group of 36 Montagnard refugees in Cambodia face imminent deportation back to Vietnam, after having their claims for protection rejected by the Cambodian government, the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network says. But rights groups and the UN's refugee agency believes the group faces persecution if refouled to Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their case is considered so strong that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had previously assisted in brokering a deal that would have seen the group removed from Cambodia in preparation for resettlement to a third country,&quot; APRRN said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite this generous offer, the Cambodian Government has denied exit permits and has reaffirmed its intention to return the group to Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR &quot;at the highest levels, has written to the Government of Cambodia, at the highest levels, to request that these individuals be allowed to leave Cambodia&quot;. It remains &quot;hopeful&quot; the group will be permitted to leave Cambodia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Montagnard - also known as Degar - ethnic minority are the people indigenous to Vietnam's central highlands. They face systematic and often violent political and religious persecution at the hands of the state. Over decades, many have fled the country, often over the land border to Cambodia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vietnam's treatment of the Montagnard has been condemned on the floor of the Australian parliament. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2014, Australia has had a resettlement arrangement with Cambodia, under which refugees from the Australian-run offshore detention islands of Manus and Nauru can choose to be resettled in the southeast Asian country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal has attracted criticism, over Cambodia's poor human rights record, and for its disproportionate cost for the protection offered. Australia has given an additional $40m in aid to Cambodia in return for the agreement, and pledged to pay up to $15m in resettlement costs, but only seven refugees have chosen to go, and, of those, four have abandoned their protection claims and returned to their countries of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the deal gives Australia influence with the Cambodian government, the Asia-Pacific Refugee Rights Network argues, and has urged the Australian government to intervene with Cambodian minister of the interior Sar Kheng to halt the imminent deportation of the Montagnard refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group faces &quot;almost certain arrest and persecution&quot; upon return, APRRN says, and &quot;the Australian government has an ethical obligation to do everything in its power to stop such action&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evan Jones, programme coordinator at APRRN, said if Cambodia returned the Montagnards to Vietnam it would clearly be in breach of the Refugee Convention principle of non-refoulement: that refugees must not be returned to danger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Refugees sent from Nauru to Cambodia may join others in lining up to leave</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Power, chief executive of the refugee council of Australia, said Australia had consistently used Cambodia's status as a party to the Refugee Convention to argue in favour of its resettlement deal, &quot;so it must act when Cambodia's adherence to the Refugee Convention is clearly under threat&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The forced return of the Montagnards would not only undermine Cambodia's reputation for respecting international law but would inflict further damage on Australia's credibility on refugee protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull confirmed on Wednesday the Cambodia deal remained current, but that his government continued to seek other 'third-country' resettlement options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an arrangement with Cambodia, and we'll always look at other options... we'll continue to seek opportunities for resettlement. But I want to be very, very clear that the people on Nauru and in PNG will not be settled in Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambodia's government faces an election next year and the country is  currently seized by a suite of brutal, occasionally violent, anti-democratic measures, as prime minister, and former Khmer Rouge commander, Hun Sen seeks to maintain his three-decade-long grip on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leader Kem Sokha has been charged with treason, independent media has been shut down, and organisations defending human rights attacked or silenced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about Cambodia's human rights record and whether the country was an appropriate place to send refugees requiring resettlement assistance and support, Turnbull told reporters: &quot;I'm focused on ensuring that we keep our borders secure. We have an arrangement with the US which, as we've just described, is seeing a number of people being resettled there. We welcome that and we thank the United States government for their support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's other resettlement deal, with the US, accepted its first 50 refugees for resettlement yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1600 of the 1700 refugees in Australia's offshore islands have expressed an interest in going to America, but it is not known how many more will be accepted, or when they might go.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests have run daily at 2pm for most of this week, and are being met with an increased security presence around the centre, and the lockdown of some compounds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus protest: refugees block police entry by lying on the ground</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been rising tensions between the refugees and Manusians in recent months, and a spate of attacks, including with machetes, on refugees in the Lorengau township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian journalist and refugee Behrouz Boochani said increasing pressure was being brought to bear on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most refugees in #Manus not sleeping well these days, &amp; need sleeping tablets. Living in PNG is like a nightmare, too much pressure on them.- Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) August 6, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Australia takes refugees by force to PNG community I can guarantee will be a big tragedy. These people extremely scared to live in PNG.- Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) August 6, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani said about 20 refugees had fallen ill and were quarantined in the detention centre's medical centre, which was operating at reduced capacity. He said it was probably because the camp had gone for days without running water for drinking and bathing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani expected the protests to be forcibly ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reliable source says local police and special forces will attack detention centre in coming days. If so, there'll be a big tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The protest at this moment is focused on 'power and water' because immigration cut power and water in the largest compound in Manus. I think in any culture in the world it's so immoral to cut the power and water on innocent people who have committed no crime. We want to let every person in Australia know that your government is doing this immoral act to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island refugees seriously injured in machete attacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the refugees did not necessarily want to go to Australia, only to a country where they would be safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous demonstrations inside the detention centre have been allowed to run for several days before security guards, Australian Border Force officials and PNG police have stormed the compounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mass hunger strike in January 2015 ended when dozens of police raided the compound, arresting and jailing those who were taking part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions on the island have risen after details of the phone call between the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the US president, Donald Trump, after the &quot;US deal&quot;, for months posited as the solution to Australia's offshore islands of Manus and Nauru, revealed the refugee swap appeared unlikely to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the detal, 1250 refugees from the Australian-controlled regional processing centres on Manus and Nauru were supposed to be exchanged for central American refugees from American-run camps in Costa Rica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Turnbull told Trump he didn't have to accept any refugees from Australia's control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a transcript of the phone call leaked on Friday, Turnbull pleaded with Trump to publicly commit to honouring the refugee swap deal, even if he didn't intend to resettle anybody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It does not require you to take any... the obligation is to only go through the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull is also heard calling the refugees &quot;economic refugees&quot; - a categorisation that does not exist. Economic hardship is not a criterion for refugee status and all those being proposed for resettlement have been found to be refugees - that is, they have a &quot;well-founded fear of persecution in their home countries&quot;. They are legally owed protection by Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of the phone call have exposed the US deal as fraudulent, Boochani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If people, media and politicians read the conversation between the Australian prime minister and American president, they can see that the US deal is a fake deal and its only purpose is to put the refugees through a long process to waste time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another refugee, Imran Mohammad, told the Human Rights Law Centre, he despaired for his future after four years on Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just cried as I was reading the transcripts of the most two powerful leaders in this world. Their words made me feel like I am just a product to them and I can be traded for anything.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warning of threats to the global asylum environment, the United Nations refugee agency's protection chief today stressed the importance of sustained engagement by the international community to keep refugees high on the political agenda.<BR><BR>&quot;The interest in refugee and displacement-related issues tends to wax and wane. We are already seeing a different dynamic today than in 2015, when refugees were foremost on the political agenda,&quot; Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Volker T&uuml;rk said in a key address to the annual Executive Committee meeting of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sustained engagement is required, especially to address protracted refugee and internal displacement situations, but also new large movements of refugees and migrants,&quot; he added, stressing that every nation must exercise its responsibility towards all people - nationals and non-nationals alike - who are subject to the jurisdiction of a country.<BR><BR>&quot;Providing protection and hope for the future does not take anything away; if properly managed, it adds and enriches,&quot; Mr. T&uuml;rk explained, adding: &quot;Sometimes this gets forgotten in the media chatter and myopic political discourse where abstract concepts and ideologies obscure the realities of human beings in distress.&quot;<BR><BR>Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Volker T&uuml;rk (left) speaks with an elderly woman in a Rohingya village near Maungdaw, northern Rakhine State, Myanmar, on 12 July 2015. Photo: UNHCR/K. Rochanakorn He added that: &quot;Asylum and refugee protection are not things thrown easily to the wind. They represent humanity at its best, and respect for each human being.&quot;<BR><BR>In this regard, next year's Global Compact on Refugees will help to sustain this much-needed interest, he said, referring to an internationally agreed document on the refugee issues to be adopted by UN Member States in 2018.<BR><BR>He said the proposed compact would broaden support base by building new and reinforcing old partnerships, such as with the World Bank, regional bodies, civil society, and the private sector, and encourage much stronger commitments to resettlement and complementary pathways.<BR><BR>The compact would also enable greater predictability and investment in the future by strengthening the resilience of both refugees and hosting communities.<BR><BR>&quot;This is a tall order, but it is achievable if we work on it together,&quot; he told representatives of 151 States that make up the Executive Committee.<BR><BR>On international protection, Mr. T&uuml;rk said violations of international refugee law are &quot;wide-ranging and occur in all parts of the world.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;In particular, they have included killings of refugees by the military,&quot; he said, adding that there has also been a surge in serious incidents of refoulement, the forced return of refugees.<BR><BR>The essence of international protection lies in identifying and recognizing the needs of people fleeing conflict, violence, human rights abuses, and other serious predicaments in their country of origin Another major worry is an increasing trend in deterrence measures by governments. Prolonged, arbitrary, and indefinite detention of asylum-seekers and refugees continues in a number of countries, including in so-called 'regional processing centres,' he said.<BR><BR>&quot;Granting asylum and protecting refugees is a humanitarian, non-political act,&quot; he said, stressing that some politicians have cast aside humanity in favour of short-term political gains, arguing that they were acting in defence of the liberty, security, and safety of their citizenry.<BR><BR>&quot;This is dangerous - not just for the many refugees whose lives are affected as a result, but also for the citizens in whose defence governments purport to act,&quot; he said.<BR><BR>A variety of terms are used to describe refugees, such as &quot;undocumented people&quot; or &quot;vulnerable migrants,&quot; possibly with the idea of making a stronger case for the rights of all people on the move. However, this has caused confusion and inadvertently provided fodder for those who wish to undermine refugees' rights.<BR><BR>&quot;I have to say that, quite apart from the erroneous legal depiction, I find it inappropriate to present people as a sub-set of anything, migrants or otherwise,&quot; he said.<BR><BR>&quot;A refugee is a refugee,&quot; he continued, explaining that there is a clear legal definition of refugees linked to absence of national protection. The essence of international protection lies in identifying and recognizing the needs of people fleeing conflict, violence, human rights abuses, and other serious predicaments in their country of origin, Mr. T&uuml;rk added.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flood of people fleeing South Sudan, coupled with delays and constraints on funding, has lead to food rations to refugees being slashed by half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to agencies working on the ground in Uganda, where most of the refugees have been arriving from the conflict across the border, food supply lines are being shut down and distribution of aid becoming increasing irregular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Portraits of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda - in pictures</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's World Food Programme said it was forced to cut the amount of grain it was handing out due to delayed payments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the funding comes late it takes a bit longer to secure the cereals. It means that you have to go to the markets to procure, transport, store and distribute,&quot; said El Khidir Daloum, WFP director for Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last fortnight, South Sudanese refugees at Nyumanzi settlement in Adjumani, which hosts about 20,000 people, protested in front of officials from the prime minister's office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus Jogo, refugee desk officer in Adjumani, said that they had to calm people down and explain that WFP did not have enough stock this month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andie Lambe, executive director at International Refugee Rights Initiative, said: &quot;Our understanding is that the ration cuts this month were as a result of a break in the food pipeline within WFP and that these cuts are both temporary and that the gap was substituted with a cash equivalent of the missing ration. In addition, WFP assured us that this would not be applied to recent arrivals and vulnerable households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The refugees are dependent on handouts due to the lack of alternatives for them to support themselves. When rumours of rations being permanently cut or stopped altogether are combined with actual cuts and without clear explanation being given for this, tensions will increase and it is not unreasonable for refugees to voice their disquiet.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheer scale of the disaster, in which more than 86% of refugees are women and children, means that strains have been put on already scarce resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Uganda is dealing with a refugee crisis of historic proportions and the country and its humanitarian partners have not been able to meet the needs of one million South Sudanese who have sought protection from violence in a relatively short amount of time,&quot; said Francisca Vigaud-Walsh of Refugees International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uganda has an exemplary refugee policy and has done what it can to provide safe harbour and land to refugees, but the needs of refugees outstrip the capacity of humanitarian responders, given that the funding simply isn't there,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May this year, WFP was forced to cut food rations to refugees in the east African nation by 50% due to severe funding shortages. The agency need an estimated $167m (&pound;126m) to provide aid through to the end of the year, but donors contributed only $30m as of September. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Bonded by spilt blood, South Sudanese refugees in Uganda reach million mark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP needs $62m to help scale up, sustain and expand life-saving assistance and protection for the next six months of more than 1.3 million refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every month we need $20m to feed the refugees in Uganda. For the next six months we have a shortage of $62m to $85m for refugees,&quot; said Daloum. &quot;We know what it takes to secure those resources, but at the same time, this is a life-saving issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, and the UN secretary general, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, hosted a summit in June in Kampala to call for action for South Sudanese refugees, with $674m needed to support them in 2017. However by August, only 21% of that sum had been raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manus prison has reached a historic landmark. It's a culmination of years of premeditated violence and affliction. For more than 10 days hundreds of refugees have been refusing to leave the prison camp and, as a result, the situation has morphed into a large-scale humanitarian crisis. If things deteriorate further, we will witness a disaster beyond imagination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Leave today or face forcible eviction, men in Manus centre told</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many who are watching from Australia or other parts of the world, particular questions have arisen, including: Why are the refugees refusing to leave the camp? From the perspective of someone who has lived in this prison for more than four years, and who has been critically analysing the politics of offshore processing throughout this time, I am certain that there is a misconception of the main reason behind our resistance - a misinterpretation of the principle driving the stand taken by the refugees. This mistake has both been made by people who are actively supporting the refugees and by individuals who have been indifferent toward the events in Manus and Nauru prisons all these years. And it also pertains to those who have supported the government's political strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The misreading of the issue is reflected in government officials and the Australian prime minister attacking senator Nick McKim, refugee advocates, the PNG immigration minister and a few incarcerated refugees, saying that they are encouraging and motivating the other refugees to remain in the prison camp. First, the PNG minister responded by explicitly stating that a few individuals who were &quot;leaders&quot; inside the prison were forcing the refugees to stay inside the detention camp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These kinds of accusations are facile and unacceptable. It comes across as a form of degradation because it strips the refugees of agency, reducing them to children who cannot make decisions on their own. It represents them as humans who lack a decent understanding of what is unfolding around them. It degrades their dignity by assuming that the refugees cannot assess the situation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side, the refugee supporters announce that the alternative accommodation units in Lorengau, Hillside Haus and West Lorengau, are not ready yet. They also claim that Lorengau is not safe to accommodate the refugees and that the new camps do not provide medical facilities and are unsuitable for housing refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the claims made by the refugee activists and human rights organisations, such as Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, are accurate and significant. However, the central point that must never be forgotten is that for more than four years the refugees of Manus prison have been detained for no reason, incarcerated without committing any crime. During these years lives have been destroyed and many families torn apart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality inside Manus prison and the reasons for the refugee resistance are totally different to what is stated in some media and claimed in official public statements. When the refugees engage in discussions, all their dialogues have one thing in common: &quot;We won't put up with being incarcerated anymore. We have no energy left to go from this prison to another prison. We haven't committed any crime and we can't tolerate prison any longer.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the conversations are driven by one thing, and one thing only, and that is freedom. Only freedom. Perhaps from all statements and all speeches published over the last week none of them hurt and angered the refugees more than the one by Peter Dutton where he said, &quot;The only difference in the new centre is that where we serve three meals a day at the [detention centre], we're asking people to prepare their own meals with food supplied&quot;. Talking about the refugees in this way is a perverse manipulation of the human dimension. Dutton is basically saying that if he were to build a prison fully equipped for comfortable living, and he incarcerated people there for years, then no one would have the right to object. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not about the prison itself and the conditions of imprisonment. It is about freedom, and it is this point that is always forgotten or ignored. In order to understand this issue, one does not need to complicate things. It is plain and simple. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The breath of death on Manus Island: starvation and sickness | Behrouz Boochani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is enough for people to imagine themselves, only for a moment, in the place of a refugee imprisoned in Manus; enough for people to imagine themselves as someone whose human dignity has been debased over these years; enough to imagine the torture this refugee has had to endure. Imagine there is nothing positive to look forward to in the future for this refugee; possibly his partner has left him; or his children have been left alone; his dreams have been shattered. He has become a mere subject for the media, a mere subject for reporters, a mere subject for photographers, a mere subject for politicians, a mere subject for human rights activists, a mere subject for intellectuals and researchers. Over these past years they have all been reinforcing a huge industry that is built on the indefinite imprisonment of this refugee. And after four and a half years they now decide to transfer him to another prison and, according to Peter Dutton's promise, provide him with three meals a day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue is plain and simple. We did not come to Australia to live in a prison. The peaceful protest by refugees is not because we want to remain in this prison. We are resisting because we want freedom in a safe environment. The core concern is freedom ... only freedom. The rest of what you hear are just peripheral issues.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2016 budget year, 85,000 refugees were admitted up from 70,000 in 2015&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trump  administration's limit of 50,000 refugees has already been reached for this budget year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional refugees may still enter the United States in the next few months but they will now face tighter regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Supreme Court order last month said the administration must admit refugees beyond the 50,000 cap if they can prove a 'bona fide relationship' with a person or entity in the United States.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was part of a broader ruling that allowed President Donald Trump to partially administer his contested travel ban affecting six Muslim majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Wednesday, 50,086 refugees have been admitted since the budget year began last October.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All those refugees have to undergo a strict screening process.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional refugees will face the same screening, but will also need to prove they have a close relative living in the United States, a job awaiting them, or admission to a college or university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2016 budget year, the U.S. admitted about 85,000 refugees, up from 70,000 the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department, which oversees the refugee program, said yesterday that it had advised resettlement agencies that the current cap was reached, though anyone traveling to the U.S. would still be admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The additional requirements are supposed to be in place for 120 days, while the government examines security and screening procedures that Trump suggested are not stringent enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a new cap will take effect before then, when the new budget year begins in October, and everything is subject to change after the Supreme Court hears arguments on the travel and refugee bans that month.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear what the new cap will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump set the refugee limit as part of the broader executive order that sought to keep out foreigners from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first iteration of the order in January caused panic and confusion at airports in the U.S. and abroad as foreigners were either denied boarding for U.S.-bound flights or stopped at a U.S. airport and sent back overseas.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal court blocked that order, and Trump issued a second order that sought to overcome the legal challenges.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court opinion lets the government partially enforce the order against anyone without a bona fide relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kay Bellor, vice president for programs at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said Wednesday that her group and other aid agencies still expect to welcome some refugees in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bellor said roughly 26,000 refugees have already been vetted, interviewed and approved for relocation to the United States and an untold number of those people will be able to prove a valid relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee Williams, vice president of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said some refugees his agency is helping have strong relationships with people in the United States, but they are in limbo while the government examines their cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's a sad day for the U.S.,' Williams said. 'This is a travel ban that destroys families and does nothing to add security to the process.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 4,000 Chadian refugees are ready to return to their home country after seeking refuge in Darfur for more than a decade. On 18 December 2018 UNHCR and the Governments of Sudan and Chad began assisting the refugees with transportation and return packages.The first convoy, including some 301 refugee, has left Um Shalya camp in Central Darfur State heading to Chad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After ten years in Darfur we called on the authorities to help us to return home safely and in dignity in order to lead stable lives and cultivate our lands&quot;, explained Osman Harun Abdallah, one of the refugee leaders from Um Shalaya camp in Central Darfur. &quot;We have been waiting for this day for a long time. We have been thinking of home day and night&quot;.<BR><BR>&quot;I thank the people of Darfur for hosting us for more than ten years.We have the same traditions and cultures and we never felt like strangers here&quot;, continued Mr. Abdullah.<BR><BR>Initially nearly 1,000 refugees are expected to return by the end of the year to Moudeina, in Sila region of Eastern Chad. Up to 4,000 refugees are planned to return in 2018 to other locations in the country.<BR><BR>&quot;UNHCR is supporting both governments to ensure that refugees are well prepared for the return and reintegration process and that both their legal and physical protection needs are met&quot;, explained Ms. Noriko Yoshida, Representative of UNHCR Sudan. &quot;We also wish to extend our appreciation to the Government of Sudan and the host communities for their generosity towards the refugees&quot;.<BR><BR>Transportation will be provided to the refugees from Central Darfur to Chad, along with return packages to help them re-establish their homes and livelihoods. UNHCR, the Government of Chad, and other partners will also work together to enhance service provision in the return areas.<BR><BR>Since the outbreak of violence in Chad from 2005 to 2007, Darfur has been hosting refugees from neighboring parts of the country. Over the last decade, UNHCR and partners have worked with the Government of Sudan to provide refugees with protection and assistance, including the establishment of two refugee camps in Central Darfur. More than 8,800 individuals still remain in the camps, half of which are now opting to return to Chad.<BR><BR>In May of this year, a tripartite agreement was signed by the Governments of both countries and UNHCR, which provides the legal framework for voluntary repatriation for Chadian refugees who wish to return to their country.<BR><BR>Returning to Chad is expected to be a lasting solution for these refugees as the security situation is permissive. The Government of Chad launched a new National Development Plan (NDP) in September 2017, which has so far attracted more than 10 billion USD in financial pledges from the international community. Now in its early stages of implementation, the plan aims to strengthen the economy while providing all citizens with access to water, health, housing, energy and mobility.<BR><BR>Chadian refugees who chose to remain in Darfur will continue to benefit from the principles of international protection.<BR><BR>Chad is itself an important refugee host country with over 300,000 people from Darfur living in camps in the east of the country.<BR><BR>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trump administration is defending its decision to dramatically curtail the number of refugees allowed into the United States to 45,000 next year, even as global humanitarian groups say it's far too low.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials say the new cap advances national security interests and reflects the country's capacity to properly screen and take in refugees.&nbsp;They say new screening requirements will be announced later.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials briefed reporters on a conference call on condition of anonymity.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. welcomed 84,995 in fiscal year 2016, and former President Barack Obama &nbsp;had wanted to raise that number to 110,000 in 2017.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump lowered the fiscal year 2017 cap to 50,000 - a number that was reached on July 12. The State Department's Refugee Processing Center says the U.S. accepted 51,392 in the first eight months of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 45,000 figure represents the maximum number of refugees the U.S. would be willing to accept.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actual number of refugees who move to the United States could actually be lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration had been considering a ceiling somewhere between 40,000, which the Homeland Security Department recommended, and 50,000, the State Department's preferred level, according to officials.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new figure appears to be a compromise that Cabinet officials felt would be palatable to the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Trump's stated hostility to accepting refugees and opposition among others in his administration mean the U.S. may not intend to fill all 45,000 slots in the 2018 fiscal year that starts Sunday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. hasn't taken in so few refugees in a single year since 2006, when 41,223 were allowed entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump attempted to put a freeze on all refugee admissions shortly after taking office in January, but federal courts limited his reach.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even as the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in to green-light his larger travel ban policy targeting six terror-prone nations, the high court has codified exceptions for refugees and others who have existing family ties in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations. They said no decision was final until formally announced by the president.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department declined to comment on potential figures ahead of a presidential announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has until Sunday to determine how many refugees to admit. A new federal government fiscal year begins October 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has made limiting immigration a centerpiece of his policy agenda. He temporarily banned visitors from the six countries - all Muslim-majority - and has rescinded an Obama-era executive action protecting young immigrants from deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president also continues to insist that he'll build a wall along the southern border with Mexico, a project that has begun with the construction of prototypes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his campaign, Trump pledged to 'stop the massive inflow of refugees' and warned of terrorists smuggling themselves into naive countries by posing as refugees fleeing war-torn Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said last October that 'thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free health care,' even as American military veterans can't get such care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has also advocated keeping refugees closer to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech to the United Nations last week, he thanked Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for taking in hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Syrian conflict, and described the United States as a 'compassionate nation' that has spent 'billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries to be part of the rebuilding process,' Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, he said, the U.S. can assist more than 10 migrants in their home regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated in 2016, said during her campaign that she would raise the number of refugees accepted each year from Syria alone to 65,000, from the existing cap of 10,000.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal judge in Seattle partially blocked U.S. President Donald Trump 's newest restrictions on refugee admissions on Saturday from 11 countries, which are mostly Muslim-majority.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the latest legal defeat for his efforts to curtail immigration  and travel to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by U.S. District Judge James Robart is the first judicial curb on rules the Trump administration put into place in late October that have contributed significantly to a steep drop in the number of refugees being admitted into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees and groups that assist them argued in court that the administration's policies violated the Constitution and federal rulemaking procedures, among other claims. Department of Justice attorneys argued in part that U.S. law grants the executive branch the authority to limit refugee admissions in the way that it had done so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Oct. 24, the Trump administration effectively paused refugee admissions from 11 countries mostly in the Middle East and Africa, pending a 90-day security review, which was set to expire in late January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countries subject to the review are Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. For each of the last three years, refugees from the 11 countries made up more than 40 percent of U.S. admissions. A Reuters review of State Department data showed that as the review went into effect, refugee admissions from the 11 countries plummeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robart ruled that the administration could carry out the security review, but that it could not stop processing or admitting refugees from the 11 countries in the meantime, as long as those refugees have a 'bona fide' connection to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its new restrictions, the Trump administration had also paused a program that allowed for family reunification for refugees, pending further security screening procedures being put into place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robart ordered the government to re-start the program, known as 'follow-to-join'. Approximately 2,000 refugees were admitted into the United States in fiscal year 2015 under the program, according to Department of Homeland Security data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee advocacy groups praised Robart's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This ruling brings relief to thousands of refugees in precarious situations in the Middle East and East Africa, as well as to refugees already in the U.S. who are trying to reunite with their spouses and children,' said Mariko Hirose, litigation director for the International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the plaintiffs in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Justice Department spokeswoman, Lauren Ehrsam, said the department disagrees with Robart's ruling and is 'currently evaluating the next steps'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robart, who was appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W. Bush, emerged from relative obscurity in February, when he issued a temporary order to lift the first version of Trump's travel ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Twitter, Trump called him a 'so-called judge' whose 'ridiculous' opinion 'essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robart's ruling represented the second legal defeat in two days for the Trump administration. On Friday, a U.S. appeals court said Trump's travel ban targeting six Muslim-majority countries should not be applied to people with strong U.S. ties, but said its ruling would be put on hold pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG immigration officials and police repeatedly tried to enter the detention centre on Friday to cut the power and water supply from some compounds. The refugees blocked their entry by lying on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian Border Force officials and officers from the Australian federal police were also on the island, directing PNG authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power and water was earlier cut from the Foxtrot compound, but a refugee who is an electrician reconnected the power from the neighbouring Mike compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has since been cut again, and refugees have been isolated from each other after guards locked the steel fences. The medical centre is not handing out medication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees have repeatedly stated they won't be forcibly removed from the detention centre until there is a safe place for them to go. They have been peacefully protesting inside the centre, chanting &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot;PNG, not safe&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PNG and Australian governments want the detention centre closed by 31 October. But there is growing resistance among the 803 men held there to being forcibly moved to the Australian-built &quot;refugee transit centre&quot; in Manus's main township of Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks, there has been a spate of attacks on refugees in Lorengau - including several involving machetes that have left victims in hospital - and growing tensions between refugees and Manusians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani said pressure was increasingly being placed on refugees to move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island detention centre closing down with refugees still inside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation in Manus is critical today. Since this morning, police tried to come in three times but the refugees lay down in their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australian federal police are guiding the local police on how they can come in the Manus RPC, but the refugees are sitting down peacefully in way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said about 50 Wilson Security guards had gathered in front of the Mike compound, the epicentre of the protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guards are here, they are going to attack the detention centre. The situation is critical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The guards are obviously trying to spark a riot. We are not going to cause any violence.We are peaceful. #manusprotest - Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) August 4, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Adam said they would continue to protest at 2pm everyday, and resist being forced from the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't feel safe to go out to Lorengau,&quot; he said. &quot;The protest is safe. There is no violence, although the guards are trying to scare us. But we are together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continued stand-off over Manus comes as the leaked transcript of a phone call in January between the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the US president, Donald Trump, reveals that the US refugee resettlement deal - long promoted as the resolution to the human rights abuses occurring offshore - appears unlikely to resettle anybody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transcript showed Turnbull telling Trump the US administration did not have to resettle any refugees from Australia's offshore islands - as agreed - if they did not want to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump described the agreement as a &quot;stupid deal&quot;, but Turnbull pleaded with him to publicly commit to honouring it, even if he did not intend to resettle anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus Island detention centre was ruled illegal by the PNG supreme court more than a year ago. Australia recently agreed to pay $70m in compensation to 1,905 men it held there for their illegal detention, and for the physical and psychological harm their detention caused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite consistent revelations of physical violence - including murder - sexual abuse of women and children, allegations of torture by guards, medical neglect leading to death and catastrophic rates of mental health damage, self-harm and suicide attempts, Australia's two offshore processing centres remain operational.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A computer simulation of refugees' journeys as they flee major conflicts can correctly predict more than 75% of their destinations, and may become a vital tool for governments and NGOs to help better allocate humanitarian resources.<BR><BR>Researchers at Brunel University London, Diana Suleimenova, Dr David Bell and Dr Derek Groen from the Department of Computer Science, used publicly available refugee, conflict and geospatial data to construct simulations of refugee movements and their potential destinations for African countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data-driven simulation tool consistently managed to predict at least 75% of refugee destinations correctly after the first 12 days for three different recent African conflicts. It also out-performed alternative existing forecasting techniques ('naive predictions') to predict where, when and how many refugees are likely to arrive, and which camps are likely to become full. They reported their results in Scientific Reports.<BR><BR>The research team constructed their simulations for the Burundian crisis in 2015, triggered when Pierre Nkurunziza sought to become president for a third term; the Central African Republic (CAR) crisis in 2013, triggered when the Muslim Seleka group overthrew central government; and the Mali civil war in 2012, triggered by insurgent groups campaigning for independence of the Azawad region.<BR><BR>To make these simulations possible, and to validate their correctness, the team relied on open data sources, including refugee registration data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), conflict data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project and geographic information from Microsoft Bing Maps.<BR><BR>Although not all refugee movements are correctly predicted in their simulations, their approach reproduced the key refugee destinations in each of the three conflicts, and can be re-applied to simulate other conflict situations reported on by the UNHCR.<BR><BR>For example, in Burundi, the simulation correctly predicted the largest inflows in Nyarugusu, Mahama and Nakivale during the conflict's early stages, while in CAR the simulation correctly reproduced the growth pattern in East camp of Cameroon, as well as the stagnation of refugee influx into Chad's camps. In the case of Mali, the predictions accurately captured trends in the data for both Mbera and Abala, which together account for around three-quarters of the refugee population.<BR><BR>The researchers' approach uses a new agent-based modelling program, named Flee, which has been released to the public alongside their paper. Agent-based modelling has been used more widely to study population movements, and has become a prominent method to explain migration patterns. However, this is the first time that it has been used to predict the destinations of refugees fleeing conflicts in Africa.<BR><BR>Writing in Scientific Reports, Suleimenova, Bell and Groen explain that their simulation is not directly tailored to these conflicts, but a 'generalised simulation development approach' which can predict the distribution of refugee arrivals across camps, given a particular conflict scenario and a total number of expected refugees.<BR><BR>This simulation development approach helps organisations to rapidly develop simulations when a conflict occurs, and allows them to investigate the effect of border closures between countries and forced redirection of refugees across camps. It also helps them to define procedures for collecting data and validating simulation results, aspects which are usually not covered when presenting a simulation model alone.<BR><BR>The authors state: 'Accurate predictions can help save refugees' lives, as they help governments and NGOs to correctly allocate humanitarian resources to refugee camps, before the (often malnourished or injured) refugees themselves have arrived. To our knowledge, we are the first to attempt such predictions across multiple major conflicts using a single simulation approach.'<BR><BR>While advances continue to be made in data collection during conflicts over the past few years, the researchers urge greater investment: 'Empirical data collection during these conflicts is very challenging, in part due to the nature of the environment and in part due to the severe and structural funding shortages of UNHCR emergency response missions. Both CAR and Burundi are among the most underfunded UNHCR refugee response operations, with funding shortages of respectively 76 and 62%'.<BR><BR>With record levels of 22.5 million refugees worldwide, 'more funding for these operations is bound to save human lives, and will have the side benefit of providing more empirical data - enabling the validation of more detailed prediction models.'<BR><BR>Regarding future work, the group aims to establish collaborations with humanitarian organisations, adapting their technology to support specific humanitarian efforts, and to further reduce the time of development by automating the construction of these simulations.<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Thai newspaper Bangkok Post website on 8 July</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha thanked United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Filippo Grandi during his visit to Bangkok for cooperating with the Thai government in the voluntary repatriation of refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a human rights network yesterday issued a joint statement criticising the Thai government for failing to sufficiently protect refugees' rights on the occasion of the UNHCR visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen Prayut yesterday discussed the refugee situation in Thailand with Mr Grandi, according to deputy government spokesman Werachon Sukondhapatipak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that both sides agreed refugees are not an issue for any one country but all parties involved should contribute, and they should start at the root cause of the problem - the reasons refugees leave their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thailand has placed importance on management and prevention of the problem at the roots. Thailand receives refugees by providing humanitarian assistance. But refugees also need assistance to be settled in a third country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the first time in five years a high commissioner has visited Thailand, which is part of a regional tour of Asia-Pacific countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the UNHCR, Thailand hosts approximately 102,000 refugees, the majority of whom are long-term refugees from Myanmar living in temporary shelters along the Thai-Myanmar border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included in this figure are 8,000 &quot;urban refugees&quot; from Pakistan, Vietnam, Somalia, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, China, and other countries who are living in Bangkok and surrounding provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maj Gen Werachon said the Thai prime minister thanked the UNHCR for cooperating with Thailand in sending back refugees from Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar who volunteered to go back to their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance last October a group of 71 Myanmar refugees voluntarily went back home via the joint programme between the Thai government and the UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the human rights group criticised the Thai government for failing to provide decent living conditions for refugees, Maj Gen Werachon said the assistance that Thailand gave abided by Thai law which states those who do not have proper visas must stay in temporary shelters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It might not be so convenient or comfortable, but we have measures to ensure the places are not too crowded,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have a policy to put children in detention, but they might need to stay with their families in the temporary shelters,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen human rights groups yesterday issued a joint statement to &quot;urge the Thai government to demonstrate its commitment to protecting refugees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group criticised Thailand for forcibly returning some refugees even though that may have put their lives at risk from human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group cited a recent incident on May 26 in which Thailand transferred M Furkan Sokmen, a Turkish national with alleged links to exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, to the custody of Turkish authorities despite warnings by UN agencies that he would face human rights violations if returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, Thailand also reportedly returned to China approximately 100 alleged Uighurs -- an ethnically Turkic, predominantly Muslim minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uighurs returned to China are known to have faced persecution from the government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">520 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trump administration will allow no more than 45,000 refugees into the United States next year officials said on Tuesday, in what would be the lowest admissions level in more than a decade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Donald Trump is expected to announce the cap on refugee admissions following a lengthy debate within his administration about where to set the number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure represents the maximum number of refugees the US would be willing to accept and the actual number of refugees who move to the United States could actually be much lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration had been considering a ceiling somewhere between 40,000, which the Homeland Security Department recommended, and 50,000, the State Department's preferred level, according to officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new figure appears to be a compromise that cabinet officials felt would be palatable to the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr Trump's stated hostility to accepting refugees and opposition among others in his administration mean the US may not intend to fill all 45,000 slots in the 2018 fiscal year that starts on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US has not taken in so few refugees in a single year since 2006, when 41,223 were allowed entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department declined to comment on potential figures ahead of a presidential announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. welcomed 84,995 in fiscal year 2016, and former president Barack Obama had wanted to raise that number to 110,000 in 2017, and Mr Trump has until Sunday to determine how many refugees to admit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide, there were some 22.5 million refugees last year, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, with many more people internally displaced within their home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strong preference among aid groups and governments has been to seek conditions so refugees can return to their homes, rather than being permanently resettled in host countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump has made limiting immigration the centrepiece of his policy agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He temporarily banned visitors from a handful of Muslim-majority nations, has rescinded an Obama-era executive action protecting young immigrants from deportation and insisted he will build a wall along the southern border with Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his campaign, Mr Trump pledged to &quot;stop the massive inflow of refugees&quot; and warned of terrorists smuggling themselves into naive countries by posing as refugees fleeing war-torn Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said last October that &quot;thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free health care,&quot; even as American military veterans can't get such care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump has advocated keeping refugees closer to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech to the United Nations last week, he thanked Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for taking in hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Syrian conflict, and described the United States as a &quot;compassionate nation&quot; that has spent &quot;billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries to be part of the rebuilding process,&quot; Mr Trump said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of South Sudanese refugees sheltering in&nbsp;Uganda&nbsp;has reached 1 million, the United Nations said Thursday, a grim milestone for what has become the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest of the settlements hosting refugees from South Sudan&nbsp;is Bidi Bidi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It&nbsp;is roughly 230 square kilometres (88.8 sq. miles) and houses at least 272,000 refugees - making it the largest settlement of its kind in the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drone footage has been released by Oxfam to highlight the scale of Uganda's refugee crisis.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam and its local partners are currently supporting over 280,000 refugees in four districts with emergency food, clean water, sanitation services such as toilets, activities and information to help people stay healthy and work and training to help people earn a living.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan officials say they are overwhelmed by the flow of people fleeing South Sudan's civil war and the U.N. refugee agency urges the international community to donate more for humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An average of 1,800 South Sudanese citizens have been arriving daily in&nbsp;Uganda&nbsp;over the past 12 months, the UNHCR said in a statement. Another 1 million or more South Sudanese are sheltering in Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Congo and Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people fleeing jumped after deadly fighting again erupted in South Sudan's capital, Juba, in July 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With refugees still arriving in their thousands, the amount of aid we are able to deliver is increasingly falling short.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fundraising summit hosted by&nbsp;Uganda&nbsp;in June raised only a fraction of the $2 billion that&nbsp;Ugandan officials have said is needed to sufficiently look after the refugees and the communities hosting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This unhappy 1-million milestone must serve as a wake-up call to the international community that much more is needed from them,&quot; Sarah Jackson, an Amnesty International official in the region, said in a statement Thursday. &quot;With no resolution to the conflict in South Sudan in sight, refugees will continue to flee to&nbsp;Uganda&nbsp;and the humanitarian crisis will only escalate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the refugees are women and children fleeing violence, often along ethnic lines, since the world's newest country erupted into violence in December 2013.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan refugee officials have repeatedly warned the influx is straining the country's ability to be generous to the refugees, who often are given small plots of land for building temporary shelters and planting crops when they arrive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 70 - and possibly up to 90 - refugees held by Australia on Nauru have been accepted for resettlement in the United States, sources on the island say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff from the US state department-funded Resettlement Support Centre, currently on Nauru, have told about 70 refugees - mainly single men from Pakistan and Afghanistan but also some single women - they can resettle in America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More meetings are scheduled for coming days and up to 90 refugees are expected to be accepted in this round of resettlement offers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If and when those refugees leave the island, they will bring the number resettled under the controversial US deal to about 140 from both of Australia's offshore islands, Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at least three refugee families and nine single refugees on Nauru have also been told they have been rejected by the US and their futures remain in limbo. They have been told they have up to three months to lodge an appeal but this process is unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Turnbull avoids sit-down meeting with Jacinda Ardern on refugee offer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nauru government has been adamant that no refugees will permanently resettle in that country. It is unclear where they will be able to resettle, despite being legally owed protection by Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the refugees accepted for resettlement had their medical assessments completed several months ago, so they have now expired. They will need to be redone before people can move to the US. But induction courses, to introduce people to living in America, will commence in coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the next cohort of refugees will leave for the US in late January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resettlement Support Centre officers are also on the island to commence the interview process for those refugees who have previously expressed an interest in going to the US but who have not had an initial interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition, said the latest round of resettlement offers confirmed all of the existing concerns around the US deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's fantastically slow and completely lacking in transparency.&quot; he said. &quot;All of the anxieties on Nauru are back now, people are asking, 'Why this person and not that person? Why so few families?' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  US once locked up white Australian immigrants in 'horror' camps akin to Manus and Nauru</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's also quite obvious that, at this rate, we are looking at a very, very long time for the people on Nauru to know exactly how many are going to be selected and the time to resettle them.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees on Nauru said they had mixed feelings about the latest announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will get happy for the people who will get out of this hell,&quot; one refugee told the Guardian. &quot;But many people are still concerned for their own case ... People think, 'What will happen to us?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US deal has been mired in controversy since it was announced in November 2016. So far, only 54 refugees have been resettled and faith in the deal is fading with its sclerotic progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a phone call in January with the US president, Donald Trump, the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said America was not obliged under the deal to accept any refugees for resettlement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It does not require you to take any,&quot; he said. &quot;The obligation is to only go through the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull said of the refugees &quot;they are basically economic refugees&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economic refugee&quot; is not a term that has any meaning in domestic or international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump, who reluctantly agreed to honour the deal, struck by his predecessor, told Turnbull: &quot;You are worse than I am... maybe you should let them out of prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the offshore islands, there is scepticism the US deal will resettle more than a few dozen of the 2,000 refugees still held offshore. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But within the Australian government, there is a belief that the US will take close to the 1,250 refugees it posited and will do so by next October, when its annual humanitarian intake quota resets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 410 people are currently in Australia, having been moved &quot;onshore&quot; from offshore detention for medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have been unable to &quot;progress&quot; their application for resettlement in the US while they are in Australia, the department says. And they face having to return to offshore, even if they have been physically attacked or sexually assaulted there, in order to apply for US resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, in Geneva, Australia's offshore detention policies have again been criticised by another arm of the United Nations. After excoriating criticism last month by the UN Human Rights Committee for its breaches of international law and refusal to act on committee directions, Australia's asylum regime has been described as &quot;desperate and dangerous&quot; by the UN's committee on the elimination of racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee member Nicol&aacute;s Maragun questioned Australia as to why, after four-and-a-half years, only 54 men, women and children have been resettled in safety in the US, while more than 2,000 remain stuck in limbo on remote islands. Of the 2,000 people, 1,792 have already been found to be refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Law Centre's Amy Frew said the world was aware of the impacts of Australia's hardline asylum policy and had spoken out in opposition to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a humanitarian crisis of Malcolm Turnbull's own making,&quot; she said. &quot;He can't close his eyes to this disaster any longer. Every man, woman and child must immediately be evacuated to safety in Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The Guardian invited Boochani to keep a diary of the countdown to the closure of the Australian-run detention camp that is closing on Tuesday.                   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night the refugees were up until the early hours of the morning. You see, the department of immigration posted a document on the fences in the prison warning us that we only have until 5pm to exit the camp. If we remain we will be confronted with soldiers from the navy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island detainees fear for safety after police squads armed 'like it's a war'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a serious warning. It is a warning of impeding danger that has sent the refugees spiralling into terror. This is what has impelled the refugees to stay up until the morning. At 5am all the local and Australian guards have abandoned the camp. For the whole day there has not been a single person inside or around the parameters of the camp to protect the refugees. The situation has descended into an even worse crisis. At the same time we are receiving news from outside that the soldiers and police have armed themselves. The whole precarious situation has been militarised in a terribly perverse manner. However, no one knows for sure if the police and navy want to attack the refugees, or if they want to set upon the locals who have stolen everything from around the rim of the camp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the locals have now entered the camp and are taking away whatever they can. The situation is perilous, it is volatile to such an extent that the refugees have been forced to lock the gates from the inside because of the possibility of an attack at any moment. The refugees are in a state of terror, but they have announced that they refuse to quit and leave the camp for Lorengau. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a few hours Senator Nick McKim and an ABC reporter enter the camp. Their presence here has instilled a sense of safety among the refugees. A number of refugees represent the drama that is unfolding here; they shed tears as they stand face-to-face with the ABC cameras. The other refugees feel that those few are reflecting the anguish felt by everyone else, those few shed tears that channel the sorrows of hundreds of refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator and ABC reporters have now left the camp, and the refugees once again have to grapple with the isolation. As I write, the refugees are engaged in a large meeting inside Delta camp; they have all decided not to leave the prison and continue resisting through peaceful means. The situation has reached a critical juncture, right now there is not enough food and water here - at 5pm they will also cut off the power. The hours that await us are going to be extremely harrowing intensely dangerous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now, the atmosphere in the camp is particularly unstable - an attack by the police and navy is imminent. The refugees are drawing on all their resources, their ingenuity and their sense of brotherhood to protect themselves from danger. Everyone realises that they have been abandoned and that this system, and this system alone, will dictate their fate. Constant anxiety, constant terror, constant aggression, constant affliction, unrelenting affliction. There is nowhere to go and various threats encircle the incarcerated refugees - we sense the malignance of the navy, the fury of police, we sense the unpredictability and volatility of the locals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Diary of disaster: the last days inside Manus Island detention centre | Behrouz Boochani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're facing all these threats at the same time as feeling a deep sense of abandonment. Recently the refugees have repaired the fences that had been destroyed by the fallen tree in order to restore some security. But the fear of locals entering the camp has become a reality now with numerous people entering the prison and looting it. Security is the greatest danger that we face right now - no one feels safe in any way whatsoever and the threat of an attack looms over the prison and is deteriorating the fortitude of the refugees. Everyone here has gathered in Mike camp to discuss options and strategies - there is no choice but to gather here and find ways to support each other. The only thing left to do is find ways to resist if something were to happen suddenly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have heard that around 200 locals have also gathered in East Lorengau outside the camp. They are protesting against our transfer to this new facility. They are shouting and protesting against removing us out of the current prison and into their community. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multi-million-dollar project will bring U.S.-accredited degrees to refugees at home and abroad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Southern New Hampshire University(SNHU) has launched a major initiative to bring university degrees to refugees in the U.S. and around the world. Over the last decade, the refugee crisis has dramatically accelerated with 65.3 million displaced worldwide, and globally, less than one percent of refugees have access to higher education. &nbsp;This will be the first large scale initiative to bring American accredited university degrees to the most marginalized population in the world with a goal of educating 50,000 refugees in 20 locations by 2022.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photo -https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/537273/SNHU_Graduating_Class.jpg</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phase one of the initiative, a $10-million-dollar effort to bring SNHU's online, competency-based bachelor's and associate degrees to refugees and others affected by displacement, was made possible by a group of anonymous donors.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The refugee crisis will require concerted social, legal, and political action, but education holds the key to an alternative future of possibility,&quot; said Paul LeBlanc, president, SNHU. &quot;At SNHU, we believe education is a fundamental human right, that's why we want to bring our degrees to some of the most underserved populations in the world.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SNHU has piloted its work with refugees in Rwanda, nearly 7,000 miles away from its Manchester, New Hampshire, campus. The program is offered at two sites in Rwanda, one in the Kiziba Refugee Camp where all students are refugee learners, and one in the capital city Kigali, where a substantial number of students are refugees. Collectively, the campuses enroll more than 500 students. This summer the first cohort of refugee students graduated with associate degrees from the Kiziba campus. All of the graduates are engaged in internships outside of the camp and are now working on their bachelor's degrees.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're giving refugees hope for the future, the tools to rebuild their lives, and a transformational opportunity,&quot; said Chrystina Russell, who leads the refugee learning initiative at SNHU. &quot;Over the next five years, we will scale our work to many other locations, many of which are ready and eager to begin tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rwanda, SNHU partners with Kepler, a nonprofit organization, to deliver competency-based degrees through a blended learning delivery model that offers in-person instruction and academic and employment support. The University will form similar partnerships with other organizations as it looks to expand into other countries. Phase one of the project will include sites in East Africa and the Middle East. SNHU will partner with theUN High Commission on Refugees, theConnected Learning in Crisis Consortium,SOLVE at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and theAmerican University of Beirut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative will also be guided by an advisory board with diverse backgrounds and experiences, including former U.S. Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan; Dean of the Yale School of Architecture, Deborah Berke; and Director of Refugee Studies at the University of Oxford, Alexander Betts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Education remains the greatest source of hope and opportunity for people on the far margins of society,&quot; said Arne Duncan, advisory board member of the SNHU refugee initiative, and former U.S. Secretary of Education. &quot;SNHU's work in the camps brings education to some of the most desperate and poorly served people in the world today.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next two years, SNHU will begin programming at four new sites around the world. SNHU is also exploring ways to support the refugee population in Manchester, and is partnering with the YWCA NH to expand services locally.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tianna Rooney has already bought the poster board for the sign she'll wave when the 16-year-old refugee boy her family is taking in arrives in the United States.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rooney, a 39-year-old family therapist and mother of two from suburban Detroit, knows the exact words of welcome she'll write on it, in the teenager's native language from the African country of Eritrea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rooney's family is leaving the sign blank, for now. She and her husband, Todd, fear actually writing the words 'Welcome Home' could break her heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foster son they're waiting for is part of a small, three-decade-old US program for so-called unaccompanied refugee minors that has been halted by a series of new refugee bans and travel limits imposed by the Trump administration in the name of fighting terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By blocking the program, the US travel bans have stranded more than 100 refugee children who were already matched to waiting American foster families.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without parents or other adult relatives, those kids are living on their own in countries of temporary refuge, in limbo while their US foster parents hope for a court ruling that will allow the children to finish their journeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the June day a refugee agency matched the Rooneys with their foster son, which turned out to be the same day of the first Supreme Court ruling barring him, 'we have experienced this very unexpected ride of grief in our family,' says Rooney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the boy who fled his home country at 13 to avoid widespread forced military conscription of children continues to fend for himself on the streets in his temporary refuge in another African capital, with no phone or internet for the Rooneys to reach him to explain the delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There's part of me that really hopes he knows a family wants him,' Tianna Rooney says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the 1980s, the program for unaccompanied refugee children has brought in more than 6,000 refugee children, including 203 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'These are kids on their own, and struggling to survive,' said Elizabeth Foydel, policy counsel with the International Refugee Assistance Project, a Washington, DC, legal-aid group for refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'How long do you feel comfortable with your child not having a caregiver?' Foydel says she asks other Americans. 'Trying to manage for themselves?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program for unaccompanied refugee children from around the world is different from one started by the Obama administration in 2014 for Central American children fleeing a surge in violence there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the program for unaccompanied refugee children, kids eking out a living by themselves in a refugee camp or elsewhere must first come to the attention of a UN agency, which may choose to refer them for the US foster program, especially if the children are deemed to be particularly vulnerable wherever they are now.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children must then pass US security screenings and other requirements, and win a match with an American foster family or group home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a series of Trump administration orders, and court rulings interpreting them, are now barring refugees with no close family in the United States.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That requirement shuts out the refugee children in the foster program, who have no relatives they can turn to in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The child refugees newly blocked from waiting American foster families include five Ethiopian sisters, ages 9 to 16.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girls lost both parents in 2009, and have faced abuse alone in the war zone of neighboring South Sudan and in Sudanese cities, said Jessica Jones, policy counsel for the Baltimore-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Lutherans are one of two U.S. groups running the program on behalf of the US State Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other waiting children include a 17-year-old couple and the baby they had together in a refugee camp, where they were fleeing attacks on their Rohingya religious minority in Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her home in a Detroit suburb, Sharon Martin, 64, has bought a crib for the young refugee family from Myanmar.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the children's books she bought, Martin said, are really for her. 'If they come, I can finally read to a child again,' Martin says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee workers say the family faces forced return to Myanmar if their US arrangements fall through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Francisco, meanwhile, web designer Julie Rajagopal and husband Mike Gougherty, a senior planner for a regional ferry system, are two of the lucky ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 16-year-old boy they are fostering also fled a lifetime of forced military service in Eritrea, at 13.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he landed in March, a slight youth coming off the plane in an ill-made tracksuit, he was among the last refugee foster children to make it into the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rajagopal, 35, often had stayed up through the night calling government workers and charity officials in the faraway African hub of Cairo to speed her new foster son's paperwork.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a clear day this summer, the teen strolled with the couple at a park overlooking San Francisco.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the city's hip Mission District, he wore a red sweater and shoes he carefully matched himself, and jeans he insisted on lovingly ironing with each wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in Brighton, the Rooneys and their 10- and 12-year-old sons stack new socks and T-shirts in the bedroom they've set aside for the boy they nicknamed 'Five,' meaning the eagerly awaited fifth member of their family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tianna Rooney recently got out the poster board, thinking to work on the welcome sign. After a concerned look from her husband, she put it away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We want to think positive thoughts' that their foster son will come safely, Todd Rooney said. 'But without endangering ourselves. Without setting ourselves up for a heartache.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Donald Trump is ending his administration's refugee ban today and opening the nation's doors to people fleeing violence from most countries in the world.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applicants from 11 countries will continue to face hurdles for at least another 90 days as the administration continues a review process, a senior official said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials would not&nbsp;disclose the countries its flagging during a call with reporters early Tuesday evening, but the&nbsp;list is likely to include the countries affected by Trump's travel bans - Iraq, Sudan, Iran, Chad, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump signed an executive order today instructing his administration to move beyond the current refugee ban and replace it with a plan that officials explained to reporters this evening.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The directive authorized DHS to approve refugees from the 11 undisclosed, 'high-risk countries' that are under scrutiny on a case-by-case basis if they are proven not to be a national security threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal officials must also prove that accepting the refugees is in the national interest.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applicants will undergo more aggressive vetting than before. Officials would not describe the enhancements in detail on the call but revealed that they pertain to the application process, the interview and adjudication process and systems checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government reviewers will collect more biographical data to help the government evaluate the truthfulness of the applicants' claims about their criminal history and ties to bad actors, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraud detection officers will now be deployed to certain refugee processing centers overseas, as well, the official added.&nbsp;Enhanced screening will also including social media screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stricter vetting procedures were first outlined in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A memo to federal agencies that was released Tuesday evening said that 'improvements to the [refugee] vetting process are generally adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It gave the secretaries of State and DHS permission to 'resume that program' with instructions to 'apply special measures to certain categories of refugees whose entry continues to pose potential threats to the security and welfare of the United States.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump mandated a review of the refugee admissions process in 90 days and annually thereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ordered his administration to determine 'as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, whether any actions taken to address the risks to the security and welfare of the United States presented by permitting any category of refugees to enter this country should be modified or terminated, and, if so, what those modifications or terminations should be.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within 180 days, Trump said he wants his attorney general, with the advice of the secretary of state and the secretary of homeland security, to provide a report on the effect of refugee resettlement that addresses national security concerns, public safety, and the 'general welfare' of the United States.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump initially blocked Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S. in the early days of his administration.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that order was challenged in court on the grounds that the restrictions were intended to be a Muslim ban, Trump&nbsp;ordered a 120-day suspension on all refugee resettlement in the U.S. so his administration could conduct a thorough review of the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review period was set to end on Oct. 24. The administration declined to renew it.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials told reporters last month that the Department of Homeland Security will apply extreme vetting measures to residents of eight countries wishing to travel to the United States after their home countries could not or would not meet new vetting requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those countries are assumed to be on the new list that's being culled by the Trump administration, although officials on the call Tuesday would not say so.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters said in a report last week that the U.S. could also increase scrutiny on women and children claiming refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such checks could slow refugee admissions, even though the ban has been lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees are already vetted using biographic information and biometric data at varying levels of intensity.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet multiple sources told Reuters that the government is looking to raise the bar for women and children and bring it closer to the rules the government is applying to men.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials across administrations have required adult, males to pass more intense examinations that identify extremist ties and determine the&nbsp;applicants' propensity to become radicalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump warned repeatedly as he was running for president that Syrian men entering the United States as refugees are a 'great Trojan horse.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have no idea who these people are, where they come from,' Trump said, ignoring the 18 to 24 months of research the State Department does on each Syrian refugee applicant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the U.S. should test prospective refugees to affirm that they 'share our values and love our people.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. accepted 18,007 Syrian refugees between 2011, when the country's civil war started, and the end of 2016.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama increased refugee admissions in his second term, finishing out his time in office with a proposed cap of 85,000 in 2016.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wanted to raise the number of admission even further to 110,000 in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has said he wanted a 50,000 refugee quota, citing national security concerns. It crossed that threshold for the fiscal year that ended in September last July.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration said it would lower rate even more this fiscal year to 45,000. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS MPs congregate in the great halls of Westminster again this week after the summer recess, I hope the UK Government's woeful response to the plight of child refugees will not be forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Unicef, by July of this year, Theresa May's Government had failed to admit even one child refugee under the Dubs scheme. Before the summer, MPs from across the parties, including my former SNP colleague Joanna Cherry came together to urge the Prime Minister to drop her party's cap on the number of child refugees allowed to enter the UK under the Dubs Amendment. Initially, the Government pledged to take in 3000 unaccompanied child refugees from France, Greece and Italy via this scheme, but after allowing a mere 350 into the country, Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a complete U-turn on the promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This failure to provide sanctuary for these most vulnerable children is a terrible stain on our history. To be able to seek asylum in another country is a human right, written into the 1951 UN Convention relating to the status of refugees, the very centrepiece of international refugee protection today. We have a moral responsibility to provide a legal route to safety for these children, many of whom wish to join family members already living in the UK. What has happened to our compassion and our humanity?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend saw the two-year anniversary of the death of Alan Kurdi, the little boy who drowned in the Mediterranean while fleeing a life of unimaginable violence and fear in Syria. The haunting photograph of his lifeless body washed up on a Turkish beach seemed to act as a wake-up call to the world. The shocking plight of refugees and in particular, child refugees, fleeing from their war-torn homelands was brought into sharp focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that time, people in the UK dug deep into their pockets to donate to refugee charities. Communities came together to raise funds and individuals volunteered at refugee camps. Our Prime Minister at the time, David Cameron, spoke of being deeply moved by the tragic image of Alan, promising that the UK should &quot;fulfil our moral responsibilities&quot;, and agreeing to accept 4000 refugees a year until 2020. Even sections of the normally refugee-phobic British press adopted a more conciliatory tone. Then, in 2016, bowing to campaign and public pressure, the Government agreed to take in refugee children from the infamous Jungle camp in Calais, reuniting them with family members and integrating them into British society, a positive new beginning for these traumatised children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, this compassionate response has been short-lived. Earlier this year, the Home Secretary said the scheme was being wound up an attempt, she claimed to discourage refugees from making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean sea and to reduce the incentive to people smugglers making exorbitant amounts of money from those fleeing brutal regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some were more cynical about the Government's reasons behind their change of heart. In a bid to humour voters concerned with curbing immigration and those questioning the real age of the children who had arrived from the Calais camps, the Conservative Government turned their back on these child refugees, abandoned to their fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And their fate is a terrifying one. According to the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, 92 per cent of the 13,700 children who arrived in Italy by sea in the first half of 2017 were on their own. Last year, Europol estimated that around 10,000 unaccompanied child refugees had gone missing since 2014, some as young as four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many who remain in camps in Greece and Italy continue to live in atrocious conditions. Others who manage to make it across Europe have ended up at Calais, sleeping rough in the hope of access to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These children, deeply distressed by war and the loss of loved ones, are incredibly vulnerable to prostitution, sexual and physical abuse, slavery and trafficking. The dangers they have faced at home and now face in Europe, are far worse than anything we can imagine in our most terrible nightmares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With safe passage and sanctuary now denied for them in the UK, many choose to risk hiding in the back of lorries or worse in order to reach Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We only have to open the papers on a weekly basis to read about the unnecessary death of a child who has reached the end of hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, many people in Britain have not forgotten these children. Charities and aid workers continue their tireless work and citizens carry on raising funds through coffee mornings, bake sales and sponsored runs. They have not overlooked their moral responsibility, their duty to their fellow humans, so why has the UK Government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A visit to these camps across Europe would soon open the eyes of the Prime Minister and Home Secretary and help them to understand that a promise to a child should never be broken. History will be the judge of our response to this crisis - if we do not correct it now, we will all have failed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Evesham Vale Welcomes Refugees (EVWR) group wants to help house 20,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees in the UK over the five years up to 2021.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme was launched in late 2015 and in 2016 Worcestershire committed to receive 50 refugees from the camps in Lebanon, where there are few facilities and very little hope.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 12 families arrived during 2016 and early 2017, and were successfully housed in Worcester, Redditch and Kidderminster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group claim that Wychavon has received no refugees at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVWR has created a petition which has been circulating around local community organisations and churches, urging Wychavon Council at its meeting on December 13, to 'do our share'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EVWR recently held a meeting with Nigel Huddleston MP at Evesham Methodist Church, chaired by Revd Dr Ed Pillar from the Baptist Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr Lucy Hodgson, Worcestershire County Council's cabinet member for communities, said on behalf of Wychavon District Council and the county council: &quot;We are really pleased with the progress that families have made since arriving in Worcestershire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our focus has been on ensuring the needs of our existing families continue to be met as they enter their second year of resettlement. We are providing support so that they can continue to improve their English, learn new IT skills and meet their needs by helping them to move into employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local communities have provided a key role in supporting these families to become independent and self-reliant, so that they have the opportunity to prosper, be healthy and happy in their new lives in Worcestershire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wychavon, like all councils across the county, is committed to offering to help resettle refugees but unfortunately we were initially unable to place any in the district due to a lack of suitable and affordable accommodation in the private rented sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In conjunction with our housing partners we are currently undertaking an assessment into the availability of suitable properties within the private rented sector across Wychavon and other parts of the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The findings will be presented to the leaders of Worcestershire Councils early in the New Year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigel Huddleston, MP for Mid-Worcestershire said: &quot;I had a very constructive meeting with Evesham Vale Welcomes Refugees Group last week, who are doing some excellent work to promote the cause of refugees in our area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the UK is taking in thousands of refugees including thousands of unaccompanied children, concerns have been expressed about whether we are doing enough locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Worcestershire has taken in about 50 refugees so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The council works with local volunteer groups to help the refugees settle in to their new communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that refugees settle where they have the best chance of integrating into the local community and where local authorities have the best capacity to assist-&nbsp; and the government is working with local authorities around the country to help refugees settle in to their new lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a particular housing shortage in Worcestershire, and the local refugee welcome groups and other bodies are doing a good job at helping identify available housing that would not push other local residents already seeking social housing down the waiting lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Worcestershire refugee welcome groups have played a key role in helping refugees feel welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have helped people settle in to their local communities, use public transport,&nbsp; find&nbsp; jobs,&nbsp; learn English and find accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I praise the work they do and hope that they continue to work with the local authorities to help refugees who have been through such a harrowing experience feel welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a welcoming community in Worcestershire and I look forward to liaising with local groups like the Evesham Vale Refugee Welcome Group and the Council as we look to play our part in helping and accommodating vulnerable people who have fled terrible and often violent conditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beirut- The intensity of the war in Syria may have subsided in 2017 with the near defeat of the Islamic State (ISIS) and agreement to establish &quot;de-escalation zones&quot; in parts of the country. However, a sustainable po&shy;litical settlement seems out of reach for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means not much has changed for millions of Syrians who have lived in dire conditions in refugee camps in neighbouring countries, in&shy;cluding Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, since the onset of the conflict nearly seven years ago. Though some refu&shy;gees returned to Syria this year, most have not budged as they await a final peace settlement that ensures their safe and sustainable repatriation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Organisation for Mi&shy;gration (IOM) said approximately 600,000 Syrians returned home in the first seven months of 2017; nearly all of whom were displaced within Syria. The rest, more than 31,000, returned from Turkey, Lebanon, Jor&shy;dan and Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the rate of dis&shy;placement in 2017 was high&shy;er than the rate of returnees. More than 800,000 people were displaced during the first seven months -- many for the second or third time -- and more than 6 million are displaced within the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of asylum seekers hoping to be resettled permanently in third countries has generally been increasing, indicating that many ref&shy;ugees have little hope of returning to Syria safely anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The caseload is on the increasing side, though it has decreased slightly in the second half of 2017,&quot; said Ah&shy;mad al-Iraqi, IOM's communication officer in Beirut. &quot;IOM has resettled 80,000 refugees in Lebanon in the past three years, with 95% [of them] Syrians. The rest included Iraqis and Sudanese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada, the United States, Aus&shy;tralia and Germany have been the main recipients of asylum seekers although &quot;new countries, mainly in Latin America, have come forward like Chile,&quot; al-Iraqi added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resettlement process can take up to two years to be completed, except for in severe &quot;humanitarian cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2016, the IOM resettled 25,000 Syrian refugees from the Middle East and Africa to Canada. An additional 1,000 Syrians from Jordan were re&shy;settled in Europe and 600 -- 47% of them children -- from Egypt to Can&shy;ada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan is host to approximately 657,000 registered Syrian refugees, the highest per person after Leba&shy;non, which is home to 1.1 million registered refugees. In addition to the Syrians, Jordan has 450,000- 500,000 Iraqi refugees. Turkey re&shy;mains the largest recipient with more than 3 million Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees overstaying and the pres&shy;sure they place on public services, infrastructure and the job market have sparked calls in Lebanon for them to be repatriated. Acknowledg&shy;ing the implications of the refugee crisis, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri called on the international community to ensure their secure and voluntary return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon hosts about 450,000 Pal&shy;estinian refugees who are registered with the United Nations. They began flowing into the country more than 60 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any political process in Syria has to include a solution for the refugees. We cannot have peace in Syria with&shy;out bringing back between 5 million to 7 million refugees scattered around the world,&quot; Hariri said at a conference hosted by the Carnegie Middle East Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no sustainable political set&shy;tlement in sight, the refugees' suffer&shy;ing is not expected to end soon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE founder of a group which supported the arrival of Syrian refugees in Tamworth says she is 'disappointed' that none have been allocated to the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staffordshire County Council has revealed to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Herald</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that 'no refugees' from the proposed 10 families have been relocated in Tamworth, following the initial announcement in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlotte  Lombardi created the 'Tamworth Says Yes to Syrian Refugees' group which was set up to counter the 'Tamworth Says No to Syrian Refugees' protest held in the Tamworth Castle Grounds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the news, she said: &quot;I was disappointed that refugees fleeing devastating situations were not given what they deserved in our town, and I can only hope this is because they were provided with options. Maybe safer options, closer to more opportunities and people willing to help and support them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I work with refugee children within Birmingham and see the struggle they go through but also see how they shine and how they integrate well and give back to their communities. They want to do well and ultimately they dream of one day going back to a rebuilt and safe home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the county council confirmed that none of the proposed refugee families for Tamworth had been moved here, they did not comment on why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed that 20,000 Syrian refugees fleeing their war-torn country would be accommodated in the UK over a period of five years, and it is understood that this initiative for the Staffordshire area has now ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leader  of Tamworth Borough Council, Cllr Daniel Cook, said: &quot;Early in 2016 in response to a call for assistance from the Department for Communities and  Local Government (DCLG) and the Home Office, Local Government agreed a co-ordinated response to relocating Syrian Refugees across the country. Interestingly, last month saw the celebration of 'Refugees Week' which highlighted the cultural diversity and contributions to local life made by refugees from around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the West Midlands Region, the work was co-ordinated by the West Midlands Strategic Migration Partnership and, at a more local level, by Staffordshire County Council. The 'ask' was for each district and borough to voluntarily offer to accommodate a number of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was not just a case of finding much needed accommodation on top of existing housing demand but also employment opportunities, school places, access to medical and dental services and, most importantly given their experiences, adult and child social care and mental health services. Tamworth together with Cannock Chase and Newcastle under Lyme were the first to volunteer to take Syrian Refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not all districts and boroughs agreed to take any refugees, citing various reasons for their decisions. All in all it was agreed to accommodate between 50 and 60 families in Staffordshire (excluding Stoke who also volunteered).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our case, we chose to take 'families' in an attempt to keep family units together. Our 'pledge' was to take up to ten families as and when the co-ordinating body was ready to allocate. The situation regarding the relocation of the refugees is updated monthly at the county chief executive's meeting. At the last meeting, it was reported that accommodation had been found for all refugees directed to Staffordshire, the last of these settling in to Cannock Chase earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr Cook added: &quot;Whilst our 'pledge' has yet to be called in, the council has informed the co-ordinating body that the 'pledge' still stands and the offer remains valid and deliverable. Therefore, in the event that we are called upon  in the near future, we would uphold our commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The council's interests and involvement are represented by the chief executive at regional level and by officers from the housing team supported by elected members at a more local level.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">620 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students on the Education Studies' placement module at the UCL Institute of Education (IOE) have helped three London schools become official Refugee Welcome Schools.<BR><BR>Working with community organising group Citizens UK and NASUWT (the Teachers' Union), the accreditation scheme recognises schools that have made a commitment to welcome refugees in their institution and community. Over the next year, the scheme will educate pupils and staff about the importance of refugee protection. Those involved will participate in campaigns to improve the lives of refugees in the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Tannock, Programme Leader for the BA Education Studies at the IOE said:<BR><BR>'Many of our students are passionate about social justice organising and education. Participating in the Refugee Welcome Schools project is an opportunity for them to experience what social justice campaigns in the education sector can accomplish. They'll learn firsthand about some of the excellent work that is already being done by local schools in supporting refugee children and their families. They will also contribute their own ideas and energies in assisting schools that are developing new refugee education and organising projects in the coming year.'<BR><BR>'Many of our students have said that they have been deeply moved by their placement work and are currently hoping to take up work and volunteering activities as a result.'<BR><BR>Three of the four schools that the IOE students are working with are now fully accredited: Newman College in Brent, Leyton Sixth Form College in Waltham Forest and St Gabriel's in Camberwell.<BR><BR>Each Refugee Welcome School application is scrutinised by a Refugee Welcome Schools Panel, made up of teachers, educationalists, trades unionists, children and refugees themselves.<BR><BR>Olivia, a pupil from Saint Gabriel's College, said:<BR><BR>'We felt that the refugee crisis was very important to us so we wanted to take action that would make a difference. We thought about what a young refugee would need if they came to our school, so that we could set an example for how refugees should be treated.'<BR><BR>Second year student Rosie Gillham was a group leader for her placement team at St Gabriel's. Speaking of her experience, she said:<BR><BR>'It was incredible to see the level of engagement from the students at St Gabriel's; not only did they care about the experience of refugees, but they clearly wanted to be active in making a difference to that experience. I think this passion really energised my team and meant that we all learnt a lot in such a short space of time. The placement taught me a lot about myself and where I want to go next.'<BR><BR>Hiba Alwadi, a third year student who also took the module, is a Palestinian who speaks and teaches Arabic. Speaking of her placement at Newman College, she said:<BR><BR>'I was deeply moved by seeing how the school is committed to welcome the refugees and help them in many different ways, by giving them opportunities like anyone else. During the placement, I visited the school's EAL (English as an additional language) department that includes 300 refugees from many different countries. One of the difficulties the school was facing was the lack of Arabic-speaking staff. I felt that my heart remained in that school, and that with my Arabic language, previous experience and courage I might help the school. Following a successful interview, I will be working permanently in the EAL department from September as an Arabic-speaking teaching assistant.<BR><BR>'This module did not only increase our knowledge; it taught us so many things we never knew or experienced before. This module made us all engaged towards helping social justice in education.'<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 8,000 refugees have arrived in the United Kingdom under the Syrian refugee resettlement programme, with many expressing gratitude for the &quot;genuine&quot; welcome they had received in Britain. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study by the UN refugee agency UNHCR found the resettlement scheme was functioning well, and access to life-saving medical treatment, education and safe accommodation was benefiting vulnerable people displaced by the Syrian conflict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme (VPRS) was launched in 2014 following huge public pressure to help those fleeing the fighting. The government committed to resettling 20,000 refugees under the programme. The UNHCR said that by the middle of 2017 over 8,000 people had arrived in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UK clearly has the capacity to resettle meaningful numbers of refugees,&quot; said Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the UNHCR's representative in London. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Integration of refugees is complex. By and large it is working, and support for integration - from the public, local authorities and government - has been striking,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that with development, this model can help more refugees from Syria and elsewhere resettle here after 2020.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the VPRS, refugees are referred to the Home Office by the UNHCR, which performs eligibility, medical and security checks. Vulnerable people accepted by the scheme are then referred to local authorities for resettlement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 2017 the government expanded the programme to include those caught up in the Syrian conflict without Syrian nationality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 167 refugees were interviewed as part of the UNHCR report, more than half of whom were previously refugees in Lebanon, with the remainder travelling from Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as being &quot;heartened&quot; that their children could attend school and catch up on lost education, refugees interviewed in the study reported feeling safe in their homes and neighbourhoods, and were impressed by the efficiency of local and national government in the UK. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also found the VPRS had played a vital role in securing life-saving medical support for many resettled refugees. Two-thirds of people in the scheme were survivors of violence and torture or had specific medical needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the scheme's success, the report highlighted a number of areas for improvement, including in English language provision, and further support for housing and gaining employment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees were generally happy with housing and reported feeling secure, but said the stock of affordable rental property was limited and increasingly hard to find. Some of those posted to rural parts of the UK said they found integration harder as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR study found most children in the scheme were able to quickly acquire English skills and make friends, but gaps existed, with some schools unaware of extra funding for lessons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report added that while English classes were generally well attended, adult refugees admitted struggling with learning the language. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a minority of those interviewed in the study had found employment, as they had only been in the UK a short time. But interviewees expressed a desired to find work in the near future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR said existing work promotion schemes for refugees were limited and more national planning was required. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vargas Llosa added: &quot;Our hope is that, building on the success of the VPRS to date, the UK will commit to resettling 10,000 vulnerable refugees a year.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">508 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US has reached the Trump administration's limit of 50,000 refugees for this budget year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will not stop some additional refugees from entering the United States in the next few months, but they will now face tighter standards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Supreme Court order last month said the administration must admit refugees beyond the 50,000 cap if they can prove a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot; with a person or entity in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was part of a broader ruling that allowed President Donald Trump to partially administer his contested travel ban affecting six Muslim majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Wednesday, 50,086 refugees have been admitted since the budget year began last October. All those refugees have to undergo a strict screening process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional refugees will face the same screening, but will also need to prove they have a close relative living in the United States, a job awaiting them, or admission to a college or university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2016 budget year, the US admitted about 85,000 refugees, up from 70,000 the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department, which oversees the refugee programme, said that it had advised resettlement agencies that the current cap was reached, though anyone travelling to the US would still be admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The additional requirements are supposed to be in place for 120 days, while the government examines security and screening procedures that Mr Trump suggested are not stringent enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a new cap will take effect before then, when the new budget year begins in October, and everything is subject to change after the Supreme Court hears arguments on the travel and refugee bans that month. It is unclear what the new cap will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump set the refugee limit as part of the broader executive order that sought to keep out foreigners from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first iteration of the order in January caused panic and confusion at airports in the US and abroad as foreigners were either denied boarding for US-bound flights or stopped at a US airport and sent back overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal court blocked that order, and Mr Trump issued a second order that sought to overcome the legal challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court opinion lets the government partially enforce the order against anyone without a bona fide relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kay Bellor, vice president for programmes at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said that her group and other aid agencies still expect to welcome some refugees in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Bellor said roughly 26,000 refugees have already been vetted, interviewed and approved for relocation to the United States and an untold number of those people will be able to prove a valid relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee Williams, vice president of the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said some refugees his agency is helping have strong relationships with people in the United States, but they are in limbo while the government examines their cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a sad day for the US,&quot; Mr Williams said. &quot;This is a travel ban that destroys families and does nothing to add security to the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US has reached the Trump administration's limit of 50,000 refugees for this budget year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will not stop some additional refugees from entering the United States in the next few months, but they will now face tighter standards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Supreme Court order last month said the administration must admit refugees beyond the 50,000 cap if they can prove a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot; with a person or entity in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was part of a broader ruling that allowed President Donald Trump to partially administer his contested travel ban affecting six Muslim majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Wednesday, 50,086 refugees have been admitted since the budget year began last October. All those refugees have to undergo a strict screening process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional refugees will face the same screening, but will also need to prove they have a close relative living in the United States, a job awaiting them, or admission to a college or university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2016 budget year, the US admitted about 85,000 refugees, up from 70,000 the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department, which oversees the refugee programme, said that it had advised resettlement agencies that the current cap was reached, though anyone travelling to the US would still be admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The additional requirements are supposed to be in place for 120 days, while the government examines security and screening procedures that Mr Trump suggested are not stringent enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a new cap will take effect before then, when the new budget year begins in October, and everything is subject to change after the Supreme Court hears arguments on the travel and refugee bans that month. It is unclear what the new cap will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump set the refugee limit as part of the broader executive order that sought to keep out foreigners from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first iteration of the order in January caused panic and confusion at airports in the US and abroad as foreigners were either denied boarding for US-bound flights or stopped at a US airport and sent back overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal court blocked that order, and Mr Trump issued a second order that sought to overcome the legal challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court opinion lets the government partially enforce the order against anyone without a bona fide relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kay Bellor, vice president for programmes at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said that her group and other aid agencies still expect to welcome some refugees in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Bellor said roughly 26,000 refugees have already been vetted, interviewed and approved for relocation to the United States and an untold number of those people will be able to prove a valid relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee Williams, vice president of the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said some refugees his agency is helping have strong relationships with people in the United States, but they are in limbo while the government examines their cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a sad day for the US,&quot; Mr Williams said. &quot;This is a travel ban that destroys families and does nothing to add security to the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report entitled &quot;Starvation looms large as WFP runs out of stock&quot; published in English by Tanzanian newspaper Daily News website on 28 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP) has raised an alarm over funding deficit to feed 320,000 refugees in Kigoma [western Tanzania], saying it needs 23.6m dollars (about 52bn shillings) between now and December to supply food to the immigrants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP Tanzania Country Representative Michael Dunford said in a statement in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the UN agency has reduced food rations for the refugees in Mtendeli, Nduta and Nyarugusu camps in northwest Tanzania due to funding constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;WFP urgently requires 23.6m dollars between now and December to continue meeting the food and nutritional needs of the refugees,&quot; reads the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Affairs Minister Mwigulu Nchemba, addressing refugees over the weekend, warned against the reduced food rations, which he related to increased conflicts pitting the immigrants against residents around the refugees' camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;International laws require provision of food to all refugees in camps by 100 per cent of their needs... failure to provide refugees with adequate food is fuelling insecurity since they look for alternative means to fend for themselves,&quot; the minister warned. During his visit to the camps, Mr Mwigulu was informed by Muhambwe Member of Parliament, Mr Atashata Nditiye, of increased conflicts in the area, accusing refugees of stealing food from the villagers' farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer in charge of Mtendeli refugees' camp, Mr Optatus Kazonde, told the minister that the rations for refugees had been reduced to 60 per cent, noting that the reduction was one of the measures to compel immigrants to return to their home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN agency provides refugees, primarily from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with five food commodities - maize meal, pulses, super cereal, vegetable oil and salt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to funding shortages, all five commodities were reduced for August distribution, reaching only 62 per cent of the 2,100 required kilocalories, the recommended daily calorie intake, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without an immediate response from donors, further ration cuts will be necessary as food stocks are simply running out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While WFP appreciates the support received so far, we urgently appeal to donors to quickly come to the aid of the refugees and provide additional funding so that we can return to full rations and avoid any prolonged negative impacts,&quot; the WFP boss stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reducing rations result in far-reaching and potentially life-altering consequences for refugees as cutting the intake of kilocalories and nutritional support can lead to acute malnutrition and increased vulnerability to disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the five food items, WFP also provides hot meals for refugees upon arrival, supplemental rations for pregnant and nursing women and food assistance to hospital in-patients and people living with HIV/AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency noted however that hot meals for refugees entering the country and supplementary feeding programmes remain unaffected by the current ration reductions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide, delivering food assistance in emergencies and working with communities to improve nutrition and build resilience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each year, WFP assists some 80 million people in 80 countries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 60 refugees held by Australia on Manus Island will be moved to Port Moresby next week, for further interviews towards resettlement in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of those who have been told they are leaving are from the countries proscribed by US President Trump's newly-upheld travel ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees and asylum seekers on Manus are being held in new Australian-built accommodation centres on the island, after the forcible and violent clearance of the decommissioned detention centre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new accommodation facilities have been plagued by problems : large parts of the centres are not yet built, and there have been insufficient rooms and beds for the number of men held there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There remains a lack of water, food has been stolen, and the owners of the land on which the centres are built have protested against their presence, cutting electricity, blocking access roads, and threatening staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water supplies have failed at the East Lorengau centre - pictures and videos show refugees filling buckets from a water truck brought into the camp at night. Another accommodation block, Hillside Haus, has been without power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People who have been waiting for water are going to get water from a water tanker that just arrived. People in East Lorengau prison camp were waiting for food and water all day. Unbelievable and terrible conditions, worse than the old prison. #Manuspic.twitter.com/rKPVHyuDfH - Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) December 6, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> East Lorengau prison camp, right now. Immigration minister should feel ashamed for lying to public and manipulating public opinion. #Manuspic.twitter.com/KMqOMEyMJg - Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) December 6, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have been forced to wait up to seven hours for food, and, in some cases, only half have been fed, Iranian refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How many years do you want to humiliate people by making them wait for hours to get any food? This photo shows East Lorengau camp today. Yesterday people were in a long line for 7 hours, only half got food. Today the others have been waiting again all day, still waiting. #Manuspic.twitter.com/1sublMAZM0 - Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) December 6, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A notice posted in the new Manus accommodation centres said representatives from the US Resettlement Support Centre would visit Port Moresby from December 14, and that some refugees would be required to travel to the capital for appointments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US authorities will visit Port Moresby. Representative from the United States Resettlement Support Center (US RSC) will visit Port Moresby from 14 of December. Some refugees from Manus camps will be receive slips to attend appts with US RSC in Port Moresby. #Manuspic.twitter.com/glTAc86XF1 - Abdul Aziz Adam (@Aziz58825713) December 7, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Further resettlement progress is expected in coming months. Your patience is appreciated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 60 refugees - understood to be mainly Afghans, Pakistanis and Rohingya - have been told they will be travelling to Port Moresby next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None are from Iran or Somalia - countries proscribed on President Trump's &quot;travel ban&quot; that was this week upheld by a majority of justices on the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains unclear exactly what impact the travel ban executive order will have on the US resettlement deal brokered between Australia and the US before Trump came into office. The order suspends the entry into the US of nationals from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea, and Venezuela</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a clause in the order which would allow for nationals of those countries to be admitted to &quot;enable the United States to conform its conduct to a pre-existing international agreement or arrangement&quot;, but it is not known whether the US will seek to take only refugees from countries other than those proscribed. Iranians make up the largest cohort of refugees on both Manus and Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are already more than 100 refugees and asylum seekers from Australian-run offshore camps held in Port Moresby, most for medical care. Some hotels have been entirely booked out for months by the Australian Border Force to house refugees. Many of the refugees have been in Moresby for months - suffering serious health problems - but have had either one or no medical appointments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani said the refugees and asylum seekers still held on Manus - most have been there since 2013 - were frustrated &quot;because every day we have to struggle with suffering created by this system&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani said the refugees' health had deteriorated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The medical condition is much worse than before because so many people are traumatised by the last incident, when police beat the refugees. Also, some people who had a long history of psychological illness cannot get medicine. The main medical issue with those who have psychological issues, there are no facilities on Manus for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Adam said refugees were tired and hungry, and remained uncertain about their futures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is lots of pressure on the refugees in the new prison camps, there's a lack (of) water, food and power in the three different camps..&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, this week said he expected more refugees from Australia's offshore islands of Nauru and Manus to be resettled in the United States soon, but that progress of the resettlement process was a matter for US authorities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus Island detention centre is being shut down around refugees and asylum seekers while they are still living in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees inside the centre reported on Wednesday that immigration officials have said they will cut the power from the Charlie compound on Friday, forcing out refugees still living there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire Manus camp is being progressively shut down, with the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments insisting it will be closed and emptied by 31 October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gym has been closed, generators removed, the canteen de-stocked and English classes and other activities discontinued, while buildings are being progressively shut down and cordoned off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus refugees told to leave detention centre or jeopardise US resettlement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani said conditions inside the Manus Island detention centre were becoming steadily more oppressive in an effort to coerce men to accept a move to the Australian-built East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre (ELRTC) on the outskirts of the Manus province's main town, Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two weeks ago some other refugees left Foxtrot [compound] and went to the rooms which were part of the old medical clinic but they could not stay there because immigration cut the power and they were homeless for a few days,&quot; he said. &quot;Australian immigration is trying to close Foxtrot but without providing any place for the refugees who leave Foxtrot to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the refugees ask them to find a place for them, they say you must go to East Lorengau camp. East Lorengau is close to the local community and means the refugees would be forced to live in PNG.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on Wednesday, Guardian Australia reported that refugees on Manus Island have been warned that their chance of resettlement in the United States will be jeopardised if they resist moves to force them to move to the transit centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A document posted at the detention centre and headed, &quot;Manus Island closes in 123 days&quot;, reads: &quot;The Manus RPC will close on 31 October 2017. Refugees should move to the ELRTC without delay. Accommodation at the ELRTC is safe and secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you refuse to move to the ELRTC or ignore other directions given to you, your failure to cooperate will be noted. US authorities will take your history of behaviour into account when deciding whether to offer you an opportunity to resettle in the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of refugees are refusing to leave the Manus detention centre - which is isolated and on the grounds of a military base - saying they do not feel safe in Lorengau and fear being attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest of a series of assaults on refugees and asylum seekers, a Bangladeshi man was allegedly attacked with a machete in Lorengau last month. His arm was hacked so severely he needed to be evacuated to Port Moresby for emergency medical treatment. Advocates say he was robbed of his phone, money and belongings - the fourth violent robbery of a refugee or asylum seeker in the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG immigration did not return calls from Guardian Australia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Brutal truth of Australia's detention regime can't be written off. Not even for $70m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens senator Nick McKim, who recently visited Manus Island and has been in close contact with refugees inside the centre, said those held on Manus were facing an invidious choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are being bullied, intimidated and smoked out of the centre, despite having nowhere safe to sleep or live in Papua New Guinea,&quot; he said. &quot;If the worst happens and violence again flares up, it will be because of the choices [the immigration minster] Peter Dutton has made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKim said the conditions on Manus were akin to torture and growing more fraught by the day. He said the government should bring all of those held on the island to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A committee of the office of the United Nations high commissioner for human rights similarly called for an immediate end to Australia's offshore processing regime, and for all refugees and asylum seekers to be brought to Australia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a hostile phone call with Donald Trump, Malcolm Turnbull has revealed more about the controversial US refugee swap deal than he ever shared with the Australian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leaked transcript of the January phone call, which neither man thought would become public, confirms reports that the US president and the Australian prime minister clashed over the controversial deal, brokered by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, and that Turnbull sought to cajole Trump into accepting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Full transcript of Trump's phone call with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are taking people from the previous administration that they were very keen on getting out of the United States. We will take more. We will take anyone that you want us to take. The only people that we do not take are people who come by boat. So we would rather take a not-very-attractive guy that helps you out than to take a Nobel Peace Prize winner that comes by boat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turnbull's call raises significant questions about Australia's acceptance of Central American refugees. There are 31 people - from seven cases, understood to be family groups - who are being considered for resettlement. The phone call raises the question of why the Obama administration was &quot;very keen on getting [them] out of the United States&quot;? Who are these people? And why is the US so anxious to move them elsewhere?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Australia does control its offshore immigration detention centres                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For four years of offshore detention, the Australian government has consistently maintained that violence, physical and sexual abuse on the islands were &quot;matters for the governments of PNG and Nauru&quot;. This has been rejected by human rights groups, the United Nations and other national governments, who argue Australia has financial and operational control of the centres, and a legal and moral responsibility for the people it has sent offshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his phone call with Trump, Turnbull conceded Australia does have full control over the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have been under our supervision for over three years now and we know exactly everything about them ... They have been on Nauru or Manus for over three years and the only reason we cannot let them into Australia is because of our commitment to not allow people to come by boat. Otherwise we would have let them in. If they had arrived by airplane and with a tourist visa then they would be here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                      Turnbull falsely claimed those held on Australia's offshore islands were 'economic refugees'                                        </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are basically economic refugees from Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. That is the vast bulk of them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no such thing as an economic refugee. The word refugee has a strict legal definition, defined under the refugees convention, as a person, outside their country of nationality, who faces a &quot; well-founded fear of persecution &quot; on any of five grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Economic hardship is not a criterion for refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'You are worse than I am': Trump told Turnbull he admired offshore detention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the people being considered for resettlement in the US have undergone an extensive refugee status determination and have been found to be refugees. They all have a &quot;well-founded fear of persecution&quot; and are legally owed protection by Australia, the country in which they sought asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Australia's refugee resettlement program from the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts was discriminatory in favour of Christians                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia accepted 12,00 refugees from the Syrian and Iraq conflicts, additional to its annual humanitarian intake. Turnbull explicitly told Trump Christians were prefered over Muslims: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is exactly what we have done with the program to bring in 12,000 Syrian refugees, 90 per cent of which will be Christians. It will be quite deliberate and the position I have taken - I have been very open about it - is that it is a tragic fact of life that when the situation in the Middle East settles down - the people that are going to be most unlikely to have a continuing home are those Christian minorities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Leaked Trump transcripts show his incoherent, ill-informed narcissism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has been criticised for its preference for Christian refugees. Refugees are usually accepted for resettlement on the basis of greatest need - those facing the most acute circumstances, often women and children, are resettled first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christians do face persecution in Iraq and Syria - large numbers of Christians have fled both countries - but Muslims, particularly ethnic or sectarian minorities, also face severe persecution and are a much larger population. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics released under freedom of information laws show that 78% of those resettled from Syria and Iraq between July 2015 and January 2017 identified as Christian. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christians are less than 0.1% of the Iraqi population and 10% of the Syrian. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Australia's intake is disproportionate too, to the presence of Christians among the region's displaced. The UN high commissioner for refugees estimates the number of Christian refugees from Iraq at 15% and from Syria at less than 1%.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">550 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War and starvation have driven more than 1.3million people from South Sudan across the border to Uganda. The neighbouring country's willingness to help has so far managed to prevent an even greater migration crisis. Foreign Minister Gabriel wants to provide even more support to the country before it is too late. Foreign Minister Gabriel is travelling to one of the world's most important hot spots for refugees, displaced persons and migrants in Africa-- to Uganda, the site of the third largest refugee crisis in the world. Up to 2000people per day pour across the border to Uganda from South Sudan, fleeing brutal fighting and severe droughts. Uganda, a land-locked country at Lake Victoria, is nevertheless keeping its borders open for refugees. There is a huge willingness to help -- Uganda does not only take in a large number of refugees, but is also a role model as regards their integration. Refugees only spend a short period of time in refugee camps in Uganda. They can move freely around the country, are allowed to work and are even allocated a plot of land. Uganda needs help to provide this support<BR><BR>Uganda is doing its utmost to integrate refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it has pressing problems of its own. Youth unemployment has been growing ever higher for years and drought destroyed a large part of the harvest in the spring. Uganda urgently needs more support from the international community in order to be able to continue taking in people fleeing from South Sudan. Preventing a global migration crisis<BR><BR>The situation in Uganda shows that the international community must provide support at an early stage so that regional refugee movements do not become global migration crises. Neighbouring countries that help refugees must not be left to cope with the situation on their own. Foreign Minister Gabriel thus wants to encourage a new approach. There must be better coordination of development cooperation and humanitarian assistance for refugees in the future. In particular, development projects must support communities that take in large numbers of refugees so that people in need can continue to find refuge. Germany has already provided over 60 million euros in aid to Uganda this year. Journey to the hub<BR><BR>But how can one ensure that help arrives where it is most urgently needed for emergency aid and integration? During his visit to Uganda, Gabriel will go far beyond the usual talks with the political elite. The first appointment on the schedule will take the Foreign Minister and his delegation to the heart of the issue when they visit Rhino Camp Refugee Settlement in northern Uganda, currently home to over 50,000 refugees. Gabriel will meet aid workers and refugees in order to gain a first-hand impression of the situation. He will be accompanied on his trip by the musician and Africa activist Wolfgang Niedecken. Human rights will also be on the agenda<BR><BR>Gabriel will travel directly from the refugee settlement to the capital Kampala, where he will meet President Museveni. The agenda for their talks will include the human rights situation and freedom of the press.<BR><BR>On Thursday, Gabriel and his delegation will travel on to South Sudan, the origin of the conflict.<BR><BR>Distributed by APO on behalf of Germany - Federal Foreign Office.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When president Trump announced that he was slashing refugee admissions to the United States to 45,000 -&nbsp;the lowest in decades -&nbsp;the first person I thought about was 18-year-old Roqayah Mohammed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I met Roqayah in 2007 when Syria wasn't the war-torn place we know today. It was a haven for more than a million Iraqi refugees, largely the professional class, who had fled the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the war that gave the world Isis (whose leadership met in the mid-2000s in a American-run prison in Iraq called Camp Bucca, the only place on the planet where Islamic radicals could spend limitless time conspiring with secular ex-Baathists), and destabilized the entire region in ways that are far from over.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then Roqayah was a precocious green-eyed nine-year-old living with her parents and older brother in Damascus. Her mother, Ahlam, a &quot;fixer&quot; for foreign correspondents, was my translator and friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Donald Trump caps refugee admissions in 2018 to historic low</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roqayah was five when the war came to their village near Baghdad. She remembers how, overnight, a happy childhood surrounded by a loving family was supplanted by tanks, helicopters, American soldiers, fear. Her mother worked as a translator for the Wall Street Journal and later for the US Civil-Military Affairs, which made her a target of militias. After being kidnapped and ransomed, Ahlam fled with the family to Syria. It would be another three years, and a whole other story, before they were resettled in the US.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she arrived in Chicago in 2008, age 10, Roqayah knew only four words in English: yes, no, grandmother, and fish. But in the north Chicago neighborhood where the family landed, she swiftly made friends. None shared a mother tongue, so English was their lingua franca.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within a year she was fluent, and I could no longer converse with her mother without Roqayah understanding every word. Within another year her grades went from Ds to As. She moved into Honors and AP classes, and went from seeing herself as a refugee to mentoring other refugees. She wrote her college application essay on the theme of &quot;Adaptation.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is grateful to many of those who had helped her family adapt. There was the resettlement agency, Heartland Alliance, who paid the rent on an apartment for the first few months while they found their feet, showed them how to use public transit, where to buy groceries.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were the individuals who helped her parents make connections and find work-refugees pay billions more in taxes than they cost to resettle, information this administration has tried to repress. One woman even paid for Roqayah to have the same SAT coach as her own kids; the end result was six university acceptance offers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the growing climate of fear, what would she say to those who want to restrict refugees and immigration? &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she was recently asked, she said she didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but the truth was a nuanced one: the same country that had given her a new life had destroyed the old one, and that of countless others who will never have the opportunities she has had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a responsibility of the US to accept refugees because a lot of the stuff that is happening is because of them-because of the government.&quot; She paused. &quot;Sorry to be so blunt.&quot; She reminded us that what refugees spend their time worrying about is not how to kill people or blow things up, but how to learn English and find a job: &quot;They are trying to figure out what 'organization' means, or how to get on a bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new travel ban, and the record low cap on refugee admissions, have nothing to do with where terrorism originates in any case. If they did, the ban would include countries like Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the more difficult truth is not only that the ban is bad, or that refugee quotas under President Obama were better. The US lets in very few refugees, even at historic highs. From 2008 to 2011, 80,000 refugees a year were resettled; this was reduced to 76,000 in 2012, and 70,000 in 2013, where it remained until it was raised to 85,000 for fiscal year 2016. By contrast, Canada, with a tenth of the US population, took in 46,000 refugees in 2016. That would mean 460,000 in the US. And even that is negligible compared to Germany.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best way to solve the refugee crisis, of course, is not to make refugees in the first place. But it's much too late for that. What is needed now is generosity and humility, especially as most of us in North America are descended from exiles who were often fleeing dire circumstances.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Miller, the pitiless architect of this administration's anti-refugee policy (he would like to lower the cap much further), is the descendant of refugees from Stalin. In other words, his own ancestors were once in much the same position as Roqayah.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrian refugee resettlement programme, under which 20,000 vulnerable people are to be brought to Britain by 2020, is to be expanded to include other nationalities caught up in the crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has said the decision will mean that other groups such as Iraqi, Palestinian and Kurdish minorities who sought refuge in Syria before the conflict but have had to flee again can now be helped. It will also mean that mixed nationality family groups will also become eligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudd said the decision follows advice from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that a diversified resettlement quota is needed in order to address the needs of the most vulnerable refugees in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up until March 7,307 Syrian refugees, identified by the UNHCR, had been brought to Britain under the resettlement scheme. Half of them have been children. The decision to extend the scope of the scheme will not however lead to any increase in the 20,000 limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudd said: &quot;It is vitally important that we focus our support on the most vulnerable refugees in the region who have fled the atrocities in Syria, whatever their nationality. I am proud that the UK is continuing to be proactive and by expanding the scheme we are making sure our doors continue to remain open to the people who most need our help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that 235 local authorities across the UK had stepped up to provide places under the government's refugee resettlement programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme was expanded by David Cameron in September 2015 to take 20,000 from the refugee camps bordering Syria in response to the Mediterranean refugee crisis. It followed a decision by Britain to withdrew its financial support for proactive search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean for refugees and migrants at risk of their lives in open boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee resettlement scheme in Britain is open to the most vulnerable refugees who have fled the Syrian conflict and cannot return to their country of origin whatever their nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home secretary said the decision also demonstrated that Britain intended to play its part in tackling the global migration crisis by taking refugees from the region - from Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt - as well as providing humanitarian assistance in response to the Mediterranean migration crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our approach is rightly based on targeting our support so that it delivers the most impact, helps those who need it the most and avoids unintended consequences,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Commons, Rudd was challenged by the Liberal Democrat MP, Tom Brake, over why only 200 &quot;Dubs children&quot; - a reference Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who successfully secured the original commitment to take refugee children - had so far arrived when the government had promised to take 480 lone child refugees who had made it to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home secretary told him that efforts were under way with Italy and Greece to identify children who might benefit from the remaining places: &quot;I am aware of these numbers. We have made it clear that we are ready and stand able to take those additional children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of those children have already settled where they are but we remain engaged with those countries to see if we can help those children who have not settled and whose best interests would be settled by coming here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Kenyan privately-owned newspaper The Star website on 21 December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somali refugees are being pressured to leave Dadaab camp [eastern Kenya] back to insecurity, drought and hunger in Somalia, a research by Amnesty International shows.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This came as Fillipo Grandi, United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, wound up his regional trip on Thursday [21 December] with a declaration that those being repatriated are being taken back on voluntary ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report, Not Time to Go Home, Amnesty International researchers interviewed returnees living in what they termed dire conditions in overcrowded cities or displacement camps in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many returnees the report shows, left Dadaab because of dwindling food rations and services, or because of fears, stoked by Kenyan government officials, that they would be forced back with no assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In its zeal to return refugees the Kenyan government has made much of small security improvements in Somalia, but the grim reality is that many parts of the country are still plagued by violence and poverty,&quot; Charmain Mohamed, head of refugee and migrants rights at Amnesty International, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees who fled drought, conflict and hunger in Somalia he said were coerced into returning in the midst of a severe humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many now find themselves back in the same hopeless situation from which they fled and still unable to go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are about 500,000 refugees in Kenya, of whom 285,705 are Somalis residing at Daadab refugee camp that was established in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR records as at 15 December showed that a total of 72,362 Somali refugees had been repatriated from Daadab to Kismayu, Mogadishu, Baidoa and other areas with 17,791 set to leave in coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in recent months, new arrivals of about 6,000 have been reported at Daadab even though government has stopped registration of new refugees. This means they are not on ration programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of pushing refugees to further displacement and humanitarian crisis, Amnesty called for integration of refugees in Kenya as a long term and sustainable solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the situation of returnees in Somalia becomes increasingly desperate, large scale returns from Dadaab are simply not viable. Rather than pushing to return refugees into a humanitarian crisis, the Kenyan government should be looking for sustainable solutions, including offering opportunities for local integration in Kenya,&quot; Charmain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it cannot do this alone. The international community needs to step up its response, which so far has been woeful and contributed to the suffering of refugees and returnees. As hunger, disease and violence close in on returnees in Somalia, the need for true responsibility sharing has never been clearer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, Somalia is clearly not ready for the large-scale returns that have accelerated since 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly all the returnees interviewed by Amnesty International stated that they and their families were facing serious hardship in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan government has been pushing the repatriation agenda in attempts to close the refugee camps on security grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peta Credlin has accused the UN of making up an agreement with the Federal Government to settle some offshore refugees in Australia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's refugee agency, made the extraordinary claim Australia agreed to consider accepting a handful of refugees on humanitarian grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim runs counter to the Turnbull Government's declaration that no refugees detained on Manus Island or Nauru would ever set foot in Australia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR assistant high commissioner Volker Turk said it promised 'vulnerable refugees with close family ties in Australia would ultimately be allowed to settle'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have reached a very clear understanding that we would be able to refer cases - compelling humanitarian cases,' he told ABC's 7.30 on Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In exchange, the UNHCR would help move refugees from the offshore detention to the U.S. as part of the deal Malcolm Turnbull reached with Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees were due to begin moving to the U.S. in October as part of the deal, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said last week.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ms Credlin, who was former Tony Abbott's chief of staff when he established the policy as prime minister in 2013, said the government would never have made such an agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The government has been clear from day one: Never ever will they come to Australia, could not be clearer,' she told Sky News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is exactly the sort of game that you see from the UN.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Credlin said of 170 signatories to the UN refugee convention, Australia was one of only 27 countries that actually accepted refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is outrageous if you listen to the commentary around the world from the UNHCR in particular, we are pariahs,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are somehow ashamed, we are bad people, we don't look after refugees when they come to Australia, we don't pull our weight.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Credlin said any change to government policy would 'reinvigorate, revitalise, give a marketing sell' to people smugglers, whose business model it was designed to break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk said the UNHCR had so far identified 36 refugees with close family ties in Australia and compelling humanitarian cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's a border protection policy with a slippery slope where, indeed, people who are refugees are effectively punished. Part of that punishment is also how they deal with people who have family links in Australia,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was following up on statements by his boss, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, who said the Australian Government only recently informed him it would refuse to accept and refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'[Refugees have been informed] their only option is to remain where they are or to be transferred to Cambodia or to the US,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This means, for example, that some with serious medical conditions or who have undergone traumatic experiences, including sexual violence, cannot receive the support of their close family members resigning in Australia.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Credlin challenged the UNCR to 'put up or shut up' after neither Mr&nbsp;Grandi nor Mr Turk produced any evidence of the supposed agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I've never seen an international meeting that is not full of departmental official types, so if they have notes of a meeting,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If they have emails, if they have signatory documents that say Australia was going to resettle some of these people in Australia, put up or shut up, because I back the government right now on this issue.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition immigration spokesman Shayne Neumann said the UN's claim was 'extraordinary' and demanded the government release details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have repeatedly called for more transparency and for the government to release the details of the US-Australia resettlement agreement,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am calling on the government to do so again, (as well as) any side deal made in relation to the resettlement of refugees from Manus and Nauru with the UNHCR or anyone else.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr Dutton and Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar denied any agreement with the UNHCR existed and affirmed the government would not back down on its policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the government says privately is the same as what it say publicly and that is if you've arrived here illegally by boat... you won't find your way to Australia,' Mr&nbsp;Sukkar told Sky News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We don't do that because we're callous or cruel... we know if you have that pathway to residency or citizenship it creates incentives that people smugglers need to cajole people on to leaky boats.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Any statements from the UNHCR or any third party that seek to dilute or undermine that, are not consistent with the government's position.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fashion industry needs to do more to prevent the exploitation of Syrian refugees in Turkish supply chains, a new report suggests, with suggested actions including a change in purchasing policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More leading fashion brands are making efforts to prevent the exploitation of Syrian refugees in their Turkish supply chains than last year, according to a report by Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2016, only New Look and Next were judged to be taking sufficient action against exploitation. Yet in this year's survey of 37 European companies, New Look, Next, Asos, Inditex, Otto&nbsp;and SuperGroup ranked as the top brands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the other end of the scale, however, Aldi, Arcadia, Asda and LC Waikiki only provided minimal information with little evidence of action to stop exploitation of refugees. KiK, Mexx, New Yorker, River Island, s. Oliver and VF Corp failed to respond to the survey altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Work in Turkish garment factories provides a valuable lifeline for vulnerable refugees from Syria, but it also exposes them to unacceptable risks of discrimination and abuse,&quot; says Phil Bloomer, executive director of BHRRC. &quot;Some high street fashion brands like Next, New Look, Asos and Zara have made progress in protecting workers, but too many like Aldi, Asda, and Topshop are lagging way behind &amp;ndash; they should learn from the leaders, and quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report follows a similar one published by the UK charity last year, which called out fashion brands for ignoring the &quot;endemic&quot; abuse of Syrian refugees in Turkish clothing factories supplying European retailers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparel brands &quot;ignoring&quot; refugee abuse in Turkey factories</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the latest research, around 650,000 refugees are thought to be working in Turkey, and the garment industry is a key source of this employment. But most refugees don't have work permits, leading them to engage in informal work, which brings a greater risk of exploitation. The BHRRC says investigations have repeatedly revealed poor wages &amp;ndash; with women being paid half the minimum wage, and consistently less than men, and child labour used by subcontractors of European fashion brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies at the top of the BHRRC ranking are better at identifying risks of abuse in their long and complex supply chains. They have targeted plans to protect refugee workers, and mechanisms to deal with grievances and complaints, and they talk to workers' and refugee organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey revealed some notable advances. For example, 15 brands now have a specific policy prohibiting discrimination and exploitation of Syrian refugees &amp;ndash; up from nine in 2016. Brands have also strengthened and increased their audits of suppliers in Turkey: nine reported using majority unannounced audits, up from one last year. Brands are also getting better at actually identifying the Syrian workers in their supply chains &amp;ndash; a crucial first step to ending abuse, the BHRRC says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the UK charity says over half the companies assessed need to improve in at least one of five areas, with many failing to look in detail at systemic issues that drive exploitation, like the prices they pay for products, the demands they put on suppliers, and the risk of undeclared subcontracting, which sees manufacturing outsource to smaller, riskier factories without the buyer's knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best practice highlighted in this report needs to become the minimum standard across Europe,&quot; adds Bloomer. &quot;If they could work on decent terms in the garment industry, refugees in Turkey and beyond would have a chance at a better life. We welcome the advances by leading companies, but Europe's fashion brands need to ensure the price paid for the clothes on the high street ensures a living wage for vulnerable refugees and their fellow Turkish workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report recommends garment brands sourcing from Turkey should: better identify and assess worker abuse; implement refugee protection strategies (paying attention to the unique risks faced by women refugees); support Turkish suppliers to formally employ Syrian refugees; change purchasing policies ensure they are not exacerbating exploitation in Turkey; and support civil society, trade unions and workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BHRRC also recommends companies across the industry could also increase their collective impact if they collaborated to influence both suppliers and governments to better support Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior official at the UN's refugee agency said accepting around 10,000 refugees a year would be a &quot;step change&quot; for the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volker Turk, assistant commissioner at the UN High Commission for Refugees, said there was a need for countries around the world to &quot;step up&quot; to address the crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Number of child refugees in Greek detention rises 'alarmingly'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has committed to take in 20,000 refugees by 2020 under a scheme set up to cover people fleeing the Syrian conflict, with 5,453 granted humanitarian protection under the programme in the year ending March 2017, and 3,000 vulnerable children and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Turk, who was in London for talks with ministers, said he hoped the Government's response would be &quot;significantly&quot; expanded after 2020: &quot;It would be a doubling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Press Association, Mr Turk:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">:: Urged the Government to do more to end detention of asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">:: Hit out at &quot;irresponsible&quot; rhetoric from Western politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">:: Praised the response of British communities which have received refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk said he wanted to see &quot;significant numbers&quot; of refugees offered the chance of a new life in the UK after 2020, with a resettlement programme open to people fleeing trouble spots around the world, not just Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his talks with ministers he said: &quot;We had good discussions about possible ideas about what can be done post-2020 and the Government is open to discussing this and to learn the lessons from what is ongoing at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope very much that there will be a regular resettlement programme by Britain past 2020 in significant numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aspiration was for it to cover 10,000 refugees or more, effectively doubling the current rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;It would be a step change, it would not just be related to Syria. It would look at where the urgent situations are, to have a certain flexibility in responding to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we have to be very honest about the need for countries to contribute and to step up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in Serbia 'sprayed with insecticide' before forceful eviction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk praised the response of communities which had already received refugees and said some rural areas had been &quot;revived&quot; by the new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was &quot;very encouraged by the reaction in Britain, by communities at grassroots level&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so amazed when I hear about rural areas in Britain that actually they are so happy that people come to them and it almost revives parts of Britain,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He compared it to the response of developing countries in the &quot;global south&quot;, where there was often a &quot;lot of solidarity&quot; to refugees from other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see this also in Britain and I don't think we hear enough about these positive examples,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;whole of society&quot; approach was needed to address the challenges, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about attitudes, it's about engagement, it's about understanding towards the plight of people who end up - because of conflict, because of war, because of persecution - in a situation of distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Britain has a long history of asylum and sanctuary. That tradition is absolutely key and it will involve whole communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he added: &quot;You have the impression that some of the negativity is amplified but we forget about all the positive things that are happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if some of the rhetoric used by some politicians was unhelpful, he said: &quot;In the industrialised world more generally, sometimes what we see and what we notice is that emotionally-charged subjects are used for short-term political games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some ways, from the perspective of fairness, from the perspective of the rule of law, from the perspective of how societies have to deal with phenomena that exist, that's irresponsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I think it's an appeal to everyone who works in this area to come back to this voice of reason within, sometimes, very high emotions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR has previously criticised the use of detention in the asylum system, and Mr Turk said the agency was working with the Government on alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a lot of agreement that we need to look at efficiency and fairness,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to work with the Government on alternatives to detention. Detention has been an issue for us - not just here but in other countries as well. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that &quot;we need to work more on family reunification issues&quot; because family members seeking to join relatives was one of the causes of irregular migration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Welsh councils have accepted no refugees over the past year, new figures have revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a freedom of information request to all 22 Welsh local authorities, bothMerthyr TydfilandNeath Port Talbotcouncils have revealed they did not take in any refugees over the past 12 months for which they have data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other 20 council areas all took in refugees. The local authority who resettled the highest number wasCarmarthenshirewith 51, all from Syria, followed bySwanseawith 33 from Sudan, Afghanistan andSyria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In total at least 325 refugees have been taken in by councils in Wales over the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contacted about the figure, a spokesman forNeath Port Talbot councilsaid the local authority was &quot;amongst the first in Wales to play its part in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Syria, making an early commitment to settle 10 families within the county borough&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;Working closely alongside British Red Cross and local partners the council has fulfilled that commitment, delivering the resettlement programme locally and providing the necessary support to the families since their arrival in late 2015 and early 2016.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman forMerthyr Tydfil councilsaid: &quot;When the Syrian Resettlement Programme was first introduced the authority entered into a collaborative arrangement with a neighbouring authority that resulted in two families coming to Merthyr Tydfil in June and August of 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our neighbouring authority also received families and due to the workload, understandably, the resource was dedicated to that authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An officer from Merthyr Tydfil council was identified and provided guidance on the Syrian Resettlement Programme to support the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However the two families relocated themselves outside of Merthyr Tydfil county borough and therefore under the Syrian Resettlement Programme they were no longer afforded support from Home Office funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Merthyr Tydfil council officer retired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current financial position is challenging and the allocation of resources has had to be balanced with the experience this authority has had of families relocating to other areas within a relatively short period of arriving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our ongoing participation therefore remains under review.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians want to turn Wales into a 'nation of sanctuary' for refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirsty Davies-Warner, head of Oxfam Cymru, said the charity was &quot;pleased&quot; with how Wales has responded to the refugee crisis to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Since 2015, when we first called on Wales to resettle Syrian refugees, each local authority has done so. The majority of which had no previous experience of resettlement and have since gone above and beyond, taking in more people than they originally pledged to resettle which just goes to show how much can be achieved when the will is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, we know that the need for resettlement is now greater than ever - last year 20 people were forced to flee their home every minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These three immigrants have revealed the suffering they have undergone to build their lives in Wales</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a key challenge of our time and as a globally responsible nation Wales needs to maintain the momentum by continuing to offer resettlement places to vulnerable refugees and ensure that accessible and appropriate support and services are available to both asylum seekers and refugees when they arrive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes after the British Red Cross warned refugees across Wales were being placed in &quot;desperate and degrading situations&quot; as the charity called on the UK and Welsh Governments to do more to help destitute refugees in Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the figures for how many refugees your local authority took in (between December 2016 and November 2017, unless otherwise stated):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five from Bulaq, Egypt, between November 2016 and October 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">31 from Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local authority specified it has not &quot;taken in&quot; or &quot;accepted&quot; refugees but has &quot;assisted the settlement&quot; of 10 individuals from two families during the past 12 months. All were Syrian nationals resettled from the Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">51 from Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five from Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what life is like in a refugee camp for the Rohingya people fleeing Myanmar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">33 in total: four from Sudan, three from Afghanistan, and 26 from Syria between December 1, 2016 and December 1, 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council said this was through the UK Government's refugee resettlement programmes and did not include unaccompanied asylum seeker children or asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11 from Syria under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local authority also specified that since July 2016 it has resettled a further 18 individuals under the scheme, as well as eight unaccompanied asylum-seeking children of 12 that were dispersed to Cardiff by the Home Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two from Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">21 in total - 20 from Syria abd one from Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five, all from Syria, as part of the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what life is like for refugees coming to Wales</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight from Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 14 from Lebanon and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five from Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local authority said it had settled 10 families in the borough since 2015 through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme - a total of 30 people between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But up to 60 men have been left without a place to stay, because alternative accommodation is either not ready, or already overfull, official sources on the island have told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the second day of Operation Helpim Friend, PNG mobile squad officers raided the detention centre using metal batons against refugees and asylum seekers and forcing them on to buses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 300 refugees and asylum seekers - who had been living without running water, electricity, or regular food supplies for three weeks - have been moved to alternative accommodation at Lorengau township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were some minor injuries reported in the forced removal. These cannot be independently verified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two men who collapsed on Thursday, when police first entered the compound, were reported to be safe and recovering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort to physically clear the camp began on Thursday with about 50 refugees and asylum seekers taken from the detention centre to other accommodation on Manus Island - most of which is not yet fully built, without running water, electricity or security fences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from Manus say there are not enough beds at the new accommodation blocks to house all of the refugees removed from the detention centre. The Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Adam told the Guardian dozens of men left at the East Lorengau centre had no place to stay, and nowhere else they could go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani said busloads of refugees were left outside the East Lorengau centre and told there was no room for them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detention centre, where most of the refugees and asylum seekers have been held for more than four years, was officially closed on 31 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Behrouz Boochani exposed Australia's evil on Manus. The shame will outlive us all | Richard Flanagan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men who remained there resisted being moved because of a series of violent attacks against refugees in Lorengau and because of a lack of services, especially for health, in the new centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG police said the clearance of the detention centre had been completed without force and that nobody had been handcuffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has paid to build the new accommodation centres - known as East Lorengau, West Lorengau and Hillside Haus - and remains legally responsible for the welfare of the men. Australian Border Force maintains a significant presence in PNG, and retains effective control of all offshore operations. The Australian government has earmarked between $150m and $250m to be spent on Manus over the next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said the Australian government welcomed the clearance of the former detention centre. He said food, security and medical services were &quot;operational and have been available since 31 October&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is clear is that there has been an organised attempt to provoke trouble and disrupt the new facilities,&quot; Dutton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Australian government has been advised that some equipment has been sabotaged at the alternative accommodation centres, including damage to back-up generators. Vandalism has also occurred to water infrastructure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power lines to generators at Hillside Haus were cut, but this was done by PNG landowners unhappy at the imposition of the refugees' accommodation block on their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local landowners, some armed with machetes, have protested against the centres being built and threatened those inside, PNG government sources have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government's claims that alternative accommodation units are ready and suitable for habitation have been consistently refuted by independent observers, including the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Manus last week, the Guardian witnessed construction on the unfinished sites. Videos and photos from within them have been published showing blocked toilets, bathrooms without running water and buildings still under construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees and asylum seekers have consistently claimed they are not safe in the new housing in Lorengau, citing frequent violent attacks and a lack of security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, said the government should immediately accept New Zealand's standing offer to resettle 150 refugees from Australia's offshore centres Nauru and Manus annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This out-of-touch prime minister can no longer continue to shirk his responsibility; he must immediately negotiate third-country resettlement options for eligible refugees,&quot; Neumann said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens immigration spokesman, Senator Nick McKim, said: &quot;The siege is over but the danger is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The violence that Peter Dutton has inflicted on his prisoners is a stain on our national conscience.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of the main arrival points for people seeking asylum in Europe, the Greek island of Lesbos is home for thousands of refugees who are being held by European authorities at the doors of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although supposedly a passing point, refugees are staying in Lesbos's camps for several months. As reported by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), recent changes in EU policies that have been preventing the entrance of refugees in Europe and restricting the criteria for identifying people as 'vulnerable' have led to vulnerable people not being identified as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given that certain medical conditions require tests and treatments that are not available on the Greek island, this shift in policy is of great concern to us as it clearly limits vulnerable people's timely access to much needed healthcare.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of resources and &quot;drastic deterioration of the care and protection for vulnerable people&quot; have led to extremely high levels of mental health symptoms amongst refugees, MSF reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many volunteers and organisations' work in camps and the opening of community centres, however, give a glimpse of hope to the lives of refugees stuck in such vulnerable situations. With many of the islanders being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for their solidarity, Lesbos has been home to a large number of artistic initiatives and communities helping refugees with their own projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Music, art, photography, craft making and a flash mob project have been growing from people's stories, struggles and energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently based in the camp of Kara Tepe, the initiative Angels Relief Team, which is part of the charitable organisation Art Bridges, is a volunteer-based organisation specialising in providing music and art education to sensitise children to artistic expression. Helping young refugees in the three main vulnerable communities in Lesbos and around Greece, they have been carrying out activities that range from instrument teaching, pottery workshops to design and sewing workshops to help them express their emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activities offer a chance to share their artistic expression, which promotes respect between children and their social integration, and has also reduced tensions amongst different ethnic groups that live in the communities. Angela Maria Arbel&aacute;ez, who founded the project with her daughter Mar&iacute;a Francisca Rocca, celebrated. &quot;These childrennolonger see themselves as refugees, but restore self-confidence by becoming the protagonists of their own artistic expression&quot;, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arbel&aacute;ez is a fine art historian and her daughter a violinist and performance artist. They count on music teachers and pedagogues and have collaborated with numerous renowned artists from around the world, as well as received donations from many British, Irish and Spanish supporters amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practises have been helping children recover the joy which was taken away by their past experiences, who paint with brighter and happier colours. &quot;It's lovely to see again joy in some of the pictures&quot;, Maria Magee, ART volunteer told TakePart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creativity is bringing back the energy amongst refugees and their children, particularly, which has significantly improved the daily experiences in the camps. &quot;We have identified as many as about 2,000 minors who have benefited from the creative activities. We worked with a group of children who came here scared, with a stooped posture. You can now see their smiles returning to their faces and how their little bodies have regained self-confidence,&quot; Arbel&aacute;ez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesvos Solidarity, an open refugee camp based in the island, also offers creative activities engaging with refugees by singing, painting or craft making, and runs the MOSAIK support centre together with the NGO Borderline-Europe. The centre has provided cultural awareness events, choirs, theatre groups and upcycling and weaving workshops, providing dignity to a life of waiting that being at the limbo of Europe entitles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amine arrived with 90 per cent of her body burnt after fleeing her home in Aleppo, Syria. This affected her severely. She was shy, distressed and uncomfortable in her own skin,&quot; Arbel&aacute;ez said. Sharing moments with other children, she said, promoted mutual respect, and she became much more active and happier. &quot;She recovered part of her self-esteem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As reported by TakePart, refugee families are seeing the creativity bringing happiness to their children: &quot;now that they have the violin, the music, my children are very happy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bobby Loyd, visual artist and HCPC registered art therapist at Art Refuge UK, who is currently working with vulnerable people in Calais, stressed the importance of the safe space art offers to refugees. &quot;They are treated as 'other', as different, as criminals. Art offers them a chance to feel heard, witnessed, and allows them to enter a magic space to dream, imagine??? they can draw the house they would like to live in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are not trained art therapists, but volunteers in refugee camps promoting art amongst refugees to facilitate the expression of feelings and emotions that might be held back and not easily verbalised. &quot;We don't ask them, we just let them express themselves as they wish, because it's the process of the arts that is very important,&quot; Emelda Graham, volunteer teacher at Pikpa Camp told TakePart. According to MOSAIK, humanitarian aid has provided assistance &quot;necessary for people to survive, but not, in the words of some refugees, 'to remain human'&quot;. Creative activities have helped children and adults find a space of security in their limbic situations in refugee camps. &quot;We are passionate about these initiatives&quot;, Loyd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The island has also attracted a number of art initiatives that aim at raising awareness of the precarious situations that refugees are stuck in. Amnesty International organised last week, together with Lesvos Solidarity, a flash mob as a protest to the EU-Turkey deal, which has since 2016 trapped refugees on the Greek islands and prevented them from accessing the European continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The famous Chinese artist Ai Wei Wei also set up his art studio in the island last year to raise awareness about the refugee crisis through a photography-based art project. &quot;As an artist, I have to relate to humanity's struggles... I never separate these situations from my art,&quot; Wei Wei told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>

Chief reporter Martin Shipton previews an S4C programme which shows the problem hasn't gone away...</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AGRANDMOTHER says she's been shocked to discover the terrible conditions faced by thousands of refugees stranded on Greece's islands and that the crisis that hit the headlines in 2015 is far from over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caron Dukes, from Blaenau Ffestiniog, has travelled out to the islands of Leros and Samos with S4C's current affairs programme Y Byd ar Bedwar two years after volunteering there when thousands of refugees were fleeing daily across the sea from Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the situation, she says, is no better now: &quot;They've turned Greece into a massive refugee camp and it just isn't fair.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 10,000 refugees are currently trapped on the Greek islands - many held for months and some for more than a year - in what are supposed to be temporary reception and identification centres for those who land on Greek shores. However, many refugees refer to them as &quot;prisons&quot; and are concerned about conditions there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those is Majida Ali, a 40-year-old journalist from Syria. She says that she fled Damascus after being persecuted by the Assad regime and arrived on the island of Samos in April this year. &quot;I left prison but I arrived in another prison,&quot; she said. &quot;The same uniforms, the same shouting, the same www.faces.No humanity, no respect, nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee camp in Samos is severely overcrowded and many refugees have to live in tents outside the camp's boundaries, some with nothing more than blankets as a makeshift shelter. Officially, the camp has enough space to accommodate 735 refugees but there are currently more than 2,000 on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 2016 the EU decided that Greece's border with Europe should be closed for refugees and struck a deal with Turkey to improve policing of its waters to reduce the number of arrivals into Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in recent months the number of refugees arriving on Greek islands has gone up, from 1,156 in April this year to 4,866 in September, and the processing of refugees which enables them to move on from the islands has been too slow to keep up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Samos Volunteers, a charity working on the island, this is having a big impact on the availability of basic provisions like food, water and clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is also leading to concerns about the safety of vulnerable people in the camps. On 26 September the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment raised concerns about conditions in the camps, saying that the situation was &quot;highly explosive&quot; with &quot;increasing anxiety and frustration due to uncertainty about the future; a perception of insecurity; inadequate material conditions and severe overcrowding; lack of coordination of health-care services&quot;. Ms Ali says she herself doesn't feel safe in the camp. &quot;Many incidents of rape have happened, for women and for kids. Of course we report it but no-one wants to speak out about this. The problem now is becoming worse and worse with all these people. Everyone is angry now because the situation is so bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Dukes believes Europe should be doing more to help with the ongoing refugee crisis, and she is angry that EU countries, including the UK, have failed to meet their targets on receiving and rehoming refugees. The two-year programme, which ended last month, relocated fewer than a fifth of the planned 160,000 asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand that there needs to be a processing system but there has got to be a way of speeding things up to get families out of this situation,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What would happen if the boot was on the other foot? We'd expect people to help us. Do what you're supposed to as people, for other people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other parts of Greece have also been affected, with refugees and migrants arriving not only on rickety boats from Turkey but by foot across the frontier between the two countries. Last month police announced that 37 refugees, including 19 children, from Iraq, Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan, had been dumped by smugglers on the national highway outside Thessaloniki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&brvbar; Y Byd ar Bedwar will be broadcast on S4C at 9.30pm tonight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actor and human rights lawyer have invited the refugee, who is now a student at the University of Chicago, to live at their property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George hails from the blue glass state and many of his family members still live there.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ocean's 11 star told the Hollywood Reporter  at his home in &nbsp;Lake Como, Italy: '[The refugee] was on this bus to Mosul, and ISIS shot the two bus drivers and said, &quot;Anybody who wants to go to college, we will shoot them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He survived and came to America. He got through all the checks, and once he got through those, it was like, &quot;Listen, we got your back. You want to get an education? You want to move your life forward? This is something that we can do.&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George, 56, did not give the refugee's name or say how long he has been living at the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clooneys are famous for helping refugees from overseas. &nbsp;In July, the couple released a statement confirming that Google, HP and Unicef will work with the The Clooney Foundation for Justice, opening the schools for more than 3,000 refugee children in Lebanon.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement read in part:&nbsp;'Our goal with this initiative is to help provide Syrian refugee children with an education and put them on a path to be the future leaders their generation desperately needs.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year Amal, 39, made headlines when she represented Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad who was kidnapped and forced into sex slavery by ISIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amal has been pushing the UN to take more action against the terrorist group, saying: 'Not one ISIS militant has faced trial for international crimes anywhere in the world. Why is it that nothing has been done?'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;'I can not understand why you are letting ISIS get away with it. I ask the Iraqi government and the U.N. to establish an investigation and give all the victims of ISIS the justice they deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Don't let this be another Rwanda where you regret doing too little, too late,' she urged. 'Don't let ISIS get away with genocide.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cover story interview with the Hollywood Reporter touched on a variety of topics: including George's charity work in Sudan, his love for Amal and fatherhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George and Amal became first-time parents in June with the birth of their twins Alexander and Ella.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'[Fatherhood] had never been part of my DNA,' the two-time Oscar winner admitted in Wednesday's issue of the magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The first thing you think is, &quot;I hope I don't screw this up&quot;...But I'm a very good diaper guy, which I didn't know I would be.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also revealed how he popped the question to Amal in 2014. She is his second wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George said when he proposed: 'It was 20 minutes of me on my knee, waiting for her to say yes, because she was so shocked. She only said yes when Goody, Goody came on, which isn't very romantic - it's kind of mean: &quot;So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody, goody.&quot;'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George's also promoted his sixth feature directorial project Suburbicon - starring Julianne Moore and Matt Damon - which hits theaters October 27.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are not enough beds, not enough doctors and no running water or electricity at some of the new accommodation refugees on Manus Island are being coerced to move to, the United Nations refugee agency says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the standoff at the Manus detention centre  draws into its second week, stores of food, water and medicine inside the centre are dwindling, while a military blockade is stopping further supplies coming in or independent observers accessing the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food, water and electricity have been cut off for a week - ostensibly for the military to take control of the centre - but also in an effort to coerce people to leave.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Turnbull could go to Manus to see what's happening. But that would take courage | Nick McKim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the UNHCR, Catherine Stubberfield, said from Manus that the situation for those still in the detention was growing critical, and the alternatives were not sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Substantive parts of the planned alternative accommodation are still not ready. If the [approximately] 600 refugees and asylum seekers still in the regional processing centre were to leave it, existing alternative arrangements would not be sufficient for all of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Salamo Injia, the chief justice of the PNG supreme court, denied an application from a refugee to have essential services restored to the detention centre on Tuesday, saying he was satisfied the governments of PNG and Australia had provided alternative accommodation and services &quot;of good standard&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the West Lorengau site, to where refugees are being told they must move, is still a building site. Bulldozers and other heavy machinery remain on the site. There is no electricity or water connected, and only four squat toilets and showers are able to be used. There is not yet a comprehensive perimeter fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who had not yet been recognised as refugees, or whose claims for protection had been refused, are being told they must move to Hillside Haus. That facility is complete and has air-conditioning, the federal government says. But there are fewer beds at Hillside Haus than there are people being told they must move there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stubberfield said the lack of services and durable solutions remained the critical issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For refugees and asylum seekers with emergency medical needs, care available on Manus Island is inadequate. The case of an asylum seeker with coronary disease this week underscores how limited local medical facilities are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, immigration minister Peter Dutton rejected the UNCHR's claims, telling Sky News on Wednesday that the &quot;facilities are completed... We've got security there, we've got health services there&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He labelled claims that refugees and asylum seekers feared for their safety &quot;nonsense&quot;, saying it was a &quot;disgraceful and deceitful&quot; myth being pushed by advocates for their own political gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     A refugee with a history of heart attacks waited for four hours, suffering chest pain and shortness of breath, before he was taken to Lorengau hospital last week. Doctors there were ultimately only able to take his blood pressure, and the hospital's ECG machine was not working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR says that beyond the immediate issue of the situation of those still within the regional processing centre, there is little prospect for long-term resettlement in PNG for all but a handful of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While, over four years, about 30 refugees have resettled in different parts of PNG, the vast majority say they are unsafe in the country. The vaunted &quot;US deal&quot; is making little visible progress on Manus, and has resettled only 22 refugees from the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Long-term solutions outside of Papua New Guinea are now desperately needed,&quot; Stubberfield said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The massive decrease in Australian government presence and reduction of essential services does nothing to change Australia's ongoing responsibility. Unless and until appropriate solutions outside of Papua New Guinea are found for all refugees and asylum seekers, Australia's obligations for their safety and wellbeing will continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most Australian service providers have withdrawn from Manus, the Australian government maintains a significant presence on the island, of military, border force and other government personnel. Australia also maintains authority for critical operational decisions, including the ultimate control of critical medical transfers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Papua New Guinea court rejects bid to restore power and water to Manus centre</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current detention centre - known as the Manus regional processing centre and where refugees and asylum seekers have been held for more than four years - is on the site of Lombrum military base, about a 40-minute drive from Lorengau town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     After the detention regime there was ruled illegal and unconstitutional by the PNG supreme court in April 2016, the detention regime was relaxed. In May this year, it was announced the centre would close on 31 October and be taken over by the PNG military. While some refugees and asylum seekers have moved to a new facility built at Lorengau township, about 600 remain within the detention centre and are refusing to leave, saying they are not safe in in Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions between local people and the refugee population have been growing in recent months, and the history of the detention centre has been marred by violent encounters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reza Barati was murdered by guards inside the compound in 2014, this year soldiers shot at refugees inside the compound, and several refugees who have gone outside the compound have been beaten, robbed and attacked with machetes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Manusians in the Lorengau community are sympathetic towards the refugees' situation and have been trying to assist them. Others, however, resent the imposition of hundreds of young men on their small community. They argue there are not the resources or space in the town to support new people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, after initial support, there is a growing sense of disenchantment with Australia's actions in Manus, and a sense that the richer, more powerful country has simply abandoned people on the island without concern for their, or the local people's, welfare. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's immigration and border protection department has rejected much of the testimony of independent observers and refugees themselves, saying: &quot;There has been significant misreporting in recent days about the situation in Manus province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Claims that Australia 'abandoned' former-residents are not correct however; the department's staff no longer had authority to remain on the PNG naval base and they departed, along with other service provider personnel and PNG ICSA staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former residents who choose to stay at the RPC site are doing so fully informed that PNG has provided them with suitable alternatives and that these can be accessed at any time. Any claims to the contrary are simply not true.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a single person at Olga Petrov's* school knows the real reason she came to be teaching in the North of England. Even now, more than a decade after moving to the UK, it's clear that she still feels uncomfortable talking about the situation that led to her fleeing Russia. She says, hastily, that she was forced to leave due to her involvement in a political movement. &quot;There were threats to myself and my family and it became impossible to work and have a normal life. I was in a dangerous position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian-language teacher left for London with her children before settling in the North. Visiting her children's primary school every day, Petrov soon felt a strong urge to teach in her new country. &quot;I realised that there were many similarities [between schools in Russia and in the UK] - there's the same atmosphere in school, teachers are the same - and I thought that I could easily do this job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  War and violence drive 80% of people fleeing to Europe by sea, not economics</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she faced a couple of difficulties - namely improving her English and a lack of demand for Russian teachers. Ruling out the classroom, she earned a living as a private Russian tutor and interpreter for four years, but her desire to teach in a school only grew. Around this time, Petrov discovered Reconnect, a charity set up to help refugees to fulfil their ambitions of teaching in the UK. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reconnect advised and supported her to organise documents from the National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NARIC) confirming her overseas qualification, and she studied to improve her English before applying for a teacher training diploma. She worked at a primary school, then got a job as a part-time Russian teacher at a secondary school. &quot;I just knew I wanted to teach Russian,&quot; she says. &quot;I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't had the opportunity to find out about the training.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Disappearing funding                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petrov is one of an estimated 118,995 refugees living in the UK. Many of those are highly skilled but unable to easily find work. Those with a teaching background come up against a number of challenges in rejoining the profession in their new country. &quot;Many refugees are not familiar with and are in need of information and an understanding of the UK education system, learning practices, curriculum, policies, entry requirements and progression routes,&quot; explains Theodros Abraham, an associate lecturer in development studies at Birkbeck, University of London, and founder of Reconnect. &quot;The available services are few, fragmented, unfocused and short-term.&quot; Reconnect has so far helped 54 refugees from 20 countries gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) since it was started in 2003. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, funding to help refugees enter the profession has evaporated. The Refugee Council's Refugees Into Teaching programme, which supported people looking to requalify and take on paid teaching positions through mentoring and placements, closed in 2011 after three years due to cuts. The organisation now offers informal advice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it comes to refugees rebuilding teaching careers, complex and confusing requalifying pathways make this very difficult,&quot; says Andrew Lawton, integration and employment services manager at the Refugee Council. &quot;Specialist guidance is needed if we are able to support refugees back into the classroom and back into the jobs they love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specialist guidance is needed to support refugees back into the classroom and back into the jobs they love</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian Yasser al-Jassem, 36, has found it difficult to find paid teaching work. Since moving to Manchester two years ago, the former Arabic teacher has volunteered at schools and taken courses such as safeguarding child protection through Empowering Learning, a training programme designed to help place overseas teachers in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ideally I need to do my QTS but it takes years,&quot; he says.&quot;I don't know if maybe it's easier to do maths, English and science GCSE then I can apply for a teaching assistant job.&quot; He's currently working as a private Arabic tutor. He says that he still needs to improve his English before teaching in a school, but is frustrated by the lack of assistance from the authorities. &quot;The government doesn't help us,&quot; he says. &quot;The job centre pushed me to find any job, and although I'm a teacher they don't care. I want to teach - for me, it's not just a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abraham advises would-be teachers to obtain official assessment and confirmation of their overseas qualifications from NARIC, then apply for places on appropriate teacher-training programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawton adds that it is possible that a qualified teacher from outside EU can teach within a school without a UK-issued QTS, but generally it is easier to get the QTS first. He notes, though, that while undertaking a part-time teacher training programme provides the most viable opportunity for many refugees, it can be very costly given their circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Jumping the hurdles                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When refugees are able to get past the hurdles and become teachers, their background means they have the ability to inject a wealth of skills, knowledge and experience to schools. &quot;The most distinctive capacities refugees and asylum seekers can bring to classrooms are the fact that they have overcome, and are still overcoming, enormous challenges, to have got to being a teacher,&quot; says Jay Derrick, director of teacher education at University College London, Institute of Education. The college ran a special route to a standard post-compulsory PGCE for refugees and asylum seekers from 2007 to 2013 until government funding was withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that they have lived in very different situations socially, culturally, linguistically and politically means that they contribute to the diversity of classrooms, he says. Some refugee teachers talk about their backgrounds with their class. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Five ways to help migrant children settle in your class</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the case for Ines Salom Lynch, a 31-year-old primary school teacher at a school in Barnet, London. Salom Lynch arrived in the UK when she was just six years old after her family left war-torn Bosnia. She often speaks to children at the school about her background and in June organised assemblies raising awareness of refugees - giving a nod to famous refugees such as Albert Einstein - as part of Refugee Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Derrick notes, &quot;There are increasing numbers of students in UK classes who also come from families affected by migration and who may also be refugees. Teachers with experience of this themselves can obviously add value to the learning of such students, and to that of students who haven't had these experiences, and whose lives have been relatively stable.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE people of South Sudan are experiencing extreme hardship. Conflict and hunger are driving thousands out of the country to seek shelter and safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the 1.8 million who have left the country, about one million, about as much as one-third of the population of Wales, have entered Uganda to seek refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda now hosts the third-largest refugee population in the world, yet this is a severely unreported crisis. South Sudan is a relatively young country. Independence was won in 2011, but since 2013 the country has been gripped by a civil war between the South Sudanese government and various anti-governmental groups and factions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This makes the situation a humanmade crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The combination of brutal civil war, ethnic violence and political instability has displaced more than 3.5 million people, and left hundreds of thousands without food, water or safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands have died, and many more are in urgent need of some form of humanitarian aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies and NGOs have managed to push the country back from famine in the past weeks, but vast parts of the country are still suffering extreme hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 86% of the refugees fleeing these conditions are women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They need support and aid to protect them from rape, beating, torture and abandonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They leave their homes with nothing, all in the hope of finding a better future elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority travel south to Uganda, because the country has one of the most progressive refugee policies in the world, and a proud history of welcoming people fleeing conflict from other countries in Africa, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda has a history of providing rights, safety and opportunities, and this is why the majority of South Sudanese refugees travel south to Uganda, resulting in huge refugee settlements, like the Bidi Bidi refugee settlement in northern Uganda - which hosts more than 270,000 refugees, making it the biggest refugee settlement in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda permits refugees free movement, the right to work and to start businesses, and creates a system that benefits the Ugandan economy, as well as the wellbeing and livelihoods of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, with the significant increase in refugee population, the situation in Uganda is now extremely difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is struggling to cope with the high number of people who need humanitarian aid. The system is close to breaking-point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that the progressive approach hangs in the balance, and it is very possible that Uganda will not be able to provide the same level of support if the situation carries on as it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community must respond, but although funding has been committed it has not yet arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has set up an appeal with a target of US$673m to deal with the crisis, but so far only 17% has been raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandan government also requested a further US$2bn to fund the humanitarian response for the influx of refugees in the country. So far, only US$431.1m has been donated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without an increase in aid, Uganda will not be able to receive more refugees; will not be able to provide food, water, shelter, safety and opportunities to people who have lost so much already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More assistance from the international community is crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community also needs to pressure the South Sudanese government and rival factions to stop fighting, and negotiate a ceasefire to end the brutal conditions for countless men, women and children across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wales can also help. Although the Welsh Government cannot provide financial aid, there are other actions that could be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wales and Uganda have strong links through Wales For Africa; a programme designed to improve and to contribute towards international development in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wales For Africa works with communities and organisations from the third and public sectors in Africa. In Uganda, most of the partnerships exist in the south of the country, and work mainly on health, education and economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wales has links with numerous health groups in communities in Uganda, with charities like PONT and Vale of Africa working with community groups in Mbale and Tororo, in eastern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We ask the Welsh Government to urge their partners through this programme, including the Ugandan government, to make an effort to divert any possible assistance from other parts of the country to the north, where the emergency is most severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without help from the international community, be that financial or political aid, the humanitarian crisis for the South Sudanese people will continue and worsen, and Uganda will not be able to provide the shelter, help and safety the people of South Sudan desperately need.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission has announced today additional humanitarian aid for two major projects through the EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey, that both work by providing monthly transfers on a special debit card.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">EUR650 million goes to the Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN) which is implemented by the World Food Programme. A further EUR50 million will boost the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education (CCTE) project implemented by UNICEF.<BR><BR>'The EU is an innovator in humanitarian aid and we are stepping up funding for programmes that are bringing real results to over one million people. With EUR1 billion in funding, the Emergency Social Safety Net is improving lives and helping refugees and their host communities in Turkey. This is complemented by a programme encouraging children to go to school, by providing additional money on the same card. Let me commend the generosity of the Turkish people in hosting so many refugees,' said Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides.<BR><BR>The ESSN programme works by providing monthly transfers to the most vulnerable refugees via a special debit card, allowing them to purchase essential items. It already supports over 1.1 million refugees and will continue until the end of January 2019 with this additional funding. Today's announcement brings total funding to the ESSN to EUR1 billion.<BR><BR>The CCTE project, announced earlier this year, supports refugee families who register their children for school and ensure that they attend regularly. The programme, delivered by UNICEF, helps cover the costs of education and supports families to send their children to school. The project has now reached the families of over 167,000 children, and aims to help 250,000 refugee children during its first year.<BR><BR>Both programmes are implemented in close partnership with the Turkish Red Crescent, and the Turkish authorities.<BR><BR>Background<BR><BR>Turkey is host to the largest refugee population in the world - over 3.4 million people. The EU is showing solidarity and support to refugees and host communities in Turkey by providing EUR3 billion in 2016-2017 through the Facility for Refugees in Turkey.<BR><BR>EUR1.378 billion of the Facility's funds are dedicated for humanitarian projects. During 2016 and 2017, the EU has financed 45 humanitarian projects in Turkey with 19 UN and NGO partners. The EU together with its partners and Turkish authorities has delivered projects in areas like health and education, helping refugees access the services they need the most. The EU funding has helped refugees meet their basic daily needs and ensure they have access to protection services.<BR><BR>In particular for the ESSN and CCTE programmes, together with its partnership with WFP and UNICEF, the EU has worked closely with the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), the Ministry of Interior Directorate General of Migration Management and General Directorate of Civil Registration and Nationality, the Ministry of Family and Social Policy, and the Ministry of National Education.<BR><BR>For More Information<BR><BR>Factsheet: Turkey: Refugee crisis<BR><BR>Factsheet: The EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey<BR><BR>Website: The Emergency Social Safety Net<BR><BR>IP/17/5204<BR><BR>Press contacts:<BR><BR>Carlos MARTIN RUIZ DE GORDEJUELA (+32 2 296 53 22)<BR><BR>Daniel PUGLISI (+32 2 296 91 40)<BR><BR>General public inquiries: Europe Direct by phone 00 800 67 89 10 11 or by email<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in addition to a million or more other South Sudanese refugees being hosted by Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With refugees still arriving in their thousands, the amount of aid we are able to deliver is increasingly falling short. For Uganda, 674m UD dollars is needed for South Sudanese refugees this year, but so far only a fifth of this amount (21 per cent) has been received,&quot; UNHCR revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funding shortfall in Uganda according to the agency is &quot;now significantly impacting the abilities to deliver life-saving aid and key basic services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This also forced the World Food Programme to cut food rations for refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Across settlements in northern Uganda, health clinics are being forced to provide vital medical care with too few doctors, health care workers and medicines. Schooling, meanwhile, is also being impacted. Class sizes often exceed 200 pupils, with some lessons held in the open air. Many refugee children are dropping out of education as the nearest schools are too far away for them to easily access&quot; reads the UNHCR statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related statement, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has since challenged the US and Europe for closing doors on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is tragic irony that when Uganda is accepting its millionth refugee from South Sudan, with thousands more arriving every day, the United States and Europe, with such greater resources, are trying to close the door,&quot; said David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miliband adds that &quot;There is a lesson here. We should be giving aid to countries like Uganda but we should also be standing with them. If Uganda can open its arms to the vulnerable fleeing war, so can the western world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The average Ugandan earns 20 times less than the average European citizen, yet when one million refugees from war-torn Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq arrived in Europe in 2015, the response from too many political leaders was to build walls and fences to try and keep them out, rather than welcoming them to safety,&quot; says Miliband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that despite unbelievable challenges, Uganda has shown leadership and compassion on the issue of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope this can serve as a teaching moment for every country, especially the United States as the administration threatens to break away from the long bipartisan tradition of helping refugees,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June this year, world leaders, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, converged in the east African country for the first solidarity summit on refugees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.K., July 19 -- The UK Government made the following announcement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new &amp;#163;1 million funding pot to help community groups support refugees fleeing the war in Syria to settle in the UK has been announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funding was announced by the Home Secretary to mark the one year anniversary of the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-full-community-sponsorship&quot;&amp;gt;community sponsorship scheme&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (Wednesday 19 July).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community sponsorship scheme, which was launched by the Home Secretary at Lambeth Palace last year, enables community groups to take on the role of supporting refugees who have been resettled from the camps in the countries surrounding Syria in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the scheme launched last year, 53 refugees have been welcomed by 10 community groups across the UK. Community sponsors, including charities, faith groups and churches, provide housing for the refugee families, as well as helping them to integrate into life in the UK, access medical and social services, arranging English language tuition and supporting them towards employment and self-sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new 2 year &amp;#163;1 million fund will provide training and support for groups signing up to the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary Amber Rudd said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am delighted that the community sponsorship scheme has got off to such an excellent start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The work of the volunteers who have welcomed refugees into their communities over the last year is inspiring, as is the compassion of the many local authorities who have provided their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is just the beginning. I hope many more groups in the UK will be inspired to get involved. That is why I have announced this funding, to help more communities welcome vulnerable families looking to create a new life and bring real benefits to the places in which they will live and work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One year ago Lambeth Palace became the first community group to welcome a refugee family. Since then community groups from Manchester to Cornwall and Wales have also welcomed these vulnerable families into their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a special event at the Palace on Monday night, the Home Secretary met a Syrian family who have been resettled to London by the Salvation Army though the Community Sponsorship Scheme (pictured).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last year we welcomed a family of Syrian refugees to live with us here at Lambeth Palace through the community sponsorship scheme. It has been an absolute privilege and joy to get to know this special family over the last year as we've supported them to start a new life in the UK. They have been a blessing to us in so many ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's amazing to think that we are celebrating the one year anniversary of the scheme. In whatever way you can, I would encourage everyone to get involved with community sponsorship and support refugees. It is truly a life-changing experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK scheme has been set up by the government working closely with civil society groups and international partners including the Global Refugee Sponsorship Initiative, which is jointly led by the Government of Canada, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Open Society Foundations, the Radcliffe Foundation, and the University of Ottawa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The success of Canada's refugee resettlement program would not be possible without our private sponsorship program. I'm very pleased to see that the UK has already experienced similar success with its own sponsorship model within its first year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Through the community sponsorship scheme for refugees, the UK will be able to help bring more vulnerable people around the world to safety. I have no doubt that private sponsorship, which has been so positive in Canada, will also bring long-term advantages for individual communities in the UK and the entire country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community sponsorship is just one way that the UK government is helping to support refugees. The government remains on track to meet its commitment of resettling 23,000 of the most vulnerable refugees through the vulnerable person and children's resettlement schemes by 2020, with over 7000 refugees resettled as of March this year.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE UK should double the amount of refugees it takes in under resettlement programmes, the United Nations has urged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volker Turk said there was a need for countries to 'step up' to address the refugee crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior official at the UN's refugee agency said accepting around 10,000 refugees a year would be a &quot;step change&quot; for the UK.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volker Turk, the assistant commissioner at the UN High Commission for Refugees , said that there was a need for countries around the world to &quot;step up&quot; to address the crisis.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Calais REJECTS court order for better refugee facilities  Macron's prefect says Calais WILL provide water to migrants </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has committed to take in 20,000 refugees by 2020 under a scheme set up to cover people fleeing the Syrian conflict, with 5,453 granted humanitarian protection under the programme in the year ending March 2017, and 3,000 vulnerable children and family members.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Turk, who was in London for talks with ministers, said that he hoped the Government's response would be &quot;significantly&quot; expanded after 2020: &quot;It would be a doubling.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Mr Turk:&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Urged the Government to do more to end detention of asylum seekers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Hit out at &quot;irresponsible&quot; rhetoric from Western politicians.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Praised the response of British communities which have received refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk said he wanted to see &quot;significant numbers&quot; of refugees offered the chance of a new life in the UK after 2020, with a resettlement programme open to people fleeing trouble spots around the world, not just Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 10,000 refugees a year would be a 'step change' for the UK, a senior official claimed </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his talks with ministers he said: &quot;We had good discussions about possible ideas about what can be done post-2020 and the Government is open to discussing this and to learn the lessons from what is ongoing at the moment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope very much that there will be a regular resettlement programme by Britain past 2020 in significant numbers.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aspiration was for it to cover 10,000 refugees or more, effectively doubling the current rate.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;It would be a step change, it would not just be related to Syria. It would look at where the urgent situations are, to have a certain flexibility in responding to them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk said he wanted to see 'significant numbers' of refugees with a new life in the UK after 2020</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we have to be very honest about the need for countries to contribute and to step up.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk praised the response of communities which had already received refugees and claimed that some rural areas had been &quot;revived&quot; by the new arrivals.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was &quot;very encouraged by the reaction in Britain, by communities at grassroots level&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so amazed when I hear about rural areas in Britain that actually they are so happy that people come to them and it almost revives parts of Britain,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He compared it to the response of Third World countries in the &quot;global south&quot;, where there was often a &quot;lot of solidarity&quot; to refugees from other countries.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see this also in Britain and I don't think we hear enough about these positive examples,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;whole of society&quot; approach was needed to address the challenges, he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about attitudes, it's about engagement, it's about understanding towards the plight of people who end up - because of conflict, because of war, because of persecution - in a situation of distress.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk also praised the response of British communities which have received refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Britain has a long history of asylum and sanctuary. That tradition is absolutely key and it will involve whole communities.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he added: &quot;You have the impression that some of the negativity is amplified but we forget about all the positive things that are happening.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR has previously criticised the use of detention in the asylum system, and Mr Turk said the agency was working with the Government on alternatives.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to work with the Government on alternatives to detention. Detention has been an issue for us - not just here but in other countries as well,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along the US-Canada border, a tent camp has been constructed by the Canadian military to house and shelter a stream of mostly Haitian refugees fleeing from the United States for fear that Donald Trump will order their deportations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just north of an unfenced section of the friendly border that runs between Quebec and New York State, an uptick in crossings has been noticed recently, with as many as 250 refugees arriving on foot a day. But, while the tent camp is seen as a humane response to a growing problem, the refugees are still marching north to what will likely be months waiting in legal limbo for their cases to be heard.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time in my career that they have built a refugee camp,&quot; St&eacute;phane Handfield, an immigration lawyer in Montreal for 25 years, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He said that, although the government was doing a decent job housing the immigrants, temporary housing provided in places like the tent camp, Montreal's Olympic stadium, and elsewhere still aren't enough.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have been bypassing normal ports of entry as the result of a longstanding agreement between the US and Canada to turn away refugees arriving from either country at a border checkpoint - but refugee seekers who make it onto Canadian land will still be processed. Following recent crack downs on undocumented immigrants in the US, portions of the mostly Haitian population that sought refuse in the US after the 2010 earthquake have been sneaking up north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uptick in migrant crossings into Canadian territories have put incredible stresses on the government's ability to process refugee applications. As a result, the refugee claim process that previously took little time now may take months, and even then the application process for a work visa can take months longer. Even the initial registering process is bogged down, prompting the military to build the tent camp for temporary shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 100 soldiers were sent to the border to construct the tent camp, which will provide basic amenities including heat for the 500 or so refugee seekers there. The soldiers are expected to return home once the tents are set up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee claimants arriving in Canada right now may have to wait until as early as December before their eligibility interviews can be scheduled, which will hinder their ability to gain access to some critical services like healthcare and work permits, ChantalLannicello, a board member with the Quebec Association of Immigration Lawyers, said. Their source of income, as they wait in limbo, will come in the form ofcheques from the government to help cover basic costs of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't understand why, when they apply for the refugee status, the Canadian government doesn't give them a work permit. A lot of my clients - they want to work,&quot; Mr Handfield said. &quot;They don't want to be on social welfare. They don't want to take money from the government. They want to pay for their families, for their kids, for their life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada first implemented a deportation ban on Haitian refugees after a coup in 2004, and extended that measure following the 2010 earthquake. The ban expired last August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, returning to Haiti could pose risks for those in the United States. The government maintains a strict confidentiality rule for refugee processing, for fear that the names of individuals seeking asylum might make it back to the Haitian government. In addition to political risks posed to anyone who may have cause to fear the government there, a crumbling infrastructure that has been devastated by that earthquake and tropical storms has already left 175,000 people displaced and 280,000 people in &quot;highly food insecure&quot; positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many refugees appear to be hearing that they will find safe haven in the the Great White North. It is unclear if that is true, however, as Canada grapples with what to do with the large numbers of refugees they're processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already in the first half of 2017, Canada saw more than 4,300 asylum seekers walk across the border from the US. That was before the uptick of Haitians leaving the United States began. Last year, Canada accepted 50.5 percent of the 410 refugee claims from Haitians, according to government data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States this year extended in January the deportation bans on the 50,000 Haitians who had come following the devastating 2010 earthquake, but notified those same refugees in May that they should begin acquiring travel documents to return to Haiti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US, under Mr Trump's leadership, plans to impose stricter immigration standards, and has suggested it will cut legal immigration by 50 percent over 10 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MIT Enterprise Forum (MITEF) for the Pan Arab announced the launch of the second edition ofInnovate for Refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Photo:http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/553200/MITEF_Pan_Arab_Natakallam.jpg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MIT Enterprise Forum inaugurated the registration process of the competition on the 21st of August to extend till the 27th of November, 2017, after which the submission process will close, and the committees will begin to evaluate the applications. The finalists will then be announced in December, 2017 and will undergo various training. The winners will announced during the final event ceremony which will be held on January 27 and 28 in Amman, Jordan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TheInnovate for RefugeesCompetition launched last year in its first edition on the occasion of World Refugee Day. Its ultimate aim remains to find innovative, long-term solutions that address the challenges faced by refugees relating to healthcare, food, housing, education and others, while drawing on the latest innovations and developments in the world of technology. The competition is in line with MIT Enterprise Forum's role in empowering entrepreneurs to develop effective and futuristic solutions that can address societal challenges, with the active participation of the refugees themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MIT Enterprise Forum will also organize refugee trainings in conjunction with the competition. The courses are scheduled to take place in Lebanon and Jordan. They will focus on training participants on Design Thinking, a methodology that puts creative abilities to work in order to address real human challenges by treating them as opportunities. The aim of these trainings is to help refugees come up with ideas and solutions to problems that they face, form teams and participate in the competition. It should be noted that more than 15% of the participants in the first edition of the competition were refugees, and this year's edition hopes to increase this percentage with these training courses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the second edition of this competition,Hala Fadel, Chair of the board of MITEF Pan Arabsaid, &quot;The great success of the competition last year was a key incentive for us to move forward, especially since this initiative contributes to the creation of innovative solutions that address the challenges faced by refugees. These projects are created by entrepreneurs from around the world, and more importantly, from the refugee community itself. There is a high percentage of educated youth among the refugees which has been reinforced by the spread of technology and smartphones in the camps. We would like nothing more this year than to increase the number of refugee participants in this competition. We will provide training courses to help them adopt a modern and scientific methodology which will in turn assist them in coming up with innovative ideas, delivered in the correct format. All of this will hopefully translate into practical projects that can contribute to meeting the challenges and crises in refugee communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cash prizes, exceeding $100,000, will be allocated for ten winners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brussels -- To improve communication with refugees coming to Europe, EIT Digital has launched a new Artificial Intelligence (AI) and crowd-based innovation, named &quot;Capiche&quot;. Originating from the European Refugee Information and Communication Service (ERICS), itself an EIT Digital Innovation Activity, it aims to support refugees with a mobile translation and search service, including an extremist and fake news filter solution. Capiche will soon be available for mobile users. It will be the first AI-system on the market that integrates crowd-sourcing with further exploitation of the collected and interpreted data to enhance the machine-learning system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communication inside the European Union primarily depends on language and understanding each country's cultural, economic and social nature. With growing numbers of refugees every day, there are thousands and thousands of persons facing huge hurdles. To solve such barriers Capiche provides real-time multilingual communication microservices based in the cloud, offered in major EU and refugee languages.<BR><BR>Capiche will be first demonstrated at the DMEXCO conference in Cologne at booth A11 (Adobe) in Hall 6 from 13-14 September.<BR><BR>Key advantages and use cases demonstrating direct benefit for refugees include:<BR><BR>- Real-time translation service: German, English, Arabic, Persian in 2017, and many more languages in 2018<BR><BR>- Fake-news check and extremist filter<BR><BR>- Legal document check<BR><BR>- Requests for information about regional locations and public services that can be sent to the chatbot-system in a foreign language<BR><BR>Refugees often face big challenges while trying to read and understand announcements, blogs, newspapers and FAQ documents in local languages. Not knowing the local language often leads to a loss of information, unresolved questions and slower integration. Domestic operators - websites, online-journals, public administration services - refrain from direct communication with refugees because they do not understand e.g. Arabic, and refugees hardly get access to basic information that is highly necessary. Therefore, Capiche's major impact is on societal integration of refugees, as it enables mutual understanding and mediating of FAQ documents containing important information like accommodation availability, asylum procedures, culture matters or life style in the EU.<BR><BR>St&eacute;phane P&eacute;an, Digital Cities Action Line Leader asserted: &quot;Through AI algorithms and collaborative crowdsourcing, Capiche activity supports refugees with reliable translated services, improving hospitality in our European cities. Even outside this specific application, such a technology-based translation and information service has great potential for public sector providers and companies.&quot;<BR><BR>Capiche can reduce integration costs and speed-up time-to-job, while providing opportunities for services offered by public as well as private organizations in fields like transportation, healthcare, education, legal counselling, job offerings, or FMCG. All the accumulated data and content produced by refugees after analysis will be collected and translated to help match refugees' demands of businesses or institutions and vice versa.<BR><BR>Tim Polzehl, Innovation Activity Leader of ERICS from TU Berlin: &quot;Capiche will revolutionize the way we deal with multi-language content. Directing one's content to speakers of other languages will be just a click away for everybody.&quot;<BR><BR>The partners involved in this Innovation Activity are: Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Kunstliche Intelligenz GmbH, Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin, Aalto University Foundation, T-Systems Multimedia Solutions GmbH as well as Crowdee.<BR><BR>EIT Digital's Innovation Activities deliver new products or services, create startups and spinoffs to commercialise outputs from projects, and encourage the transfer of technologies for market entry.<BR><BR>Capiche (ERICS) is one of the 11 Innovation Activities of the Digital Cities Action Line for 2017. This Action Line leverages the digital transformation of the cities through centralised, participative and collaborative interactions between city actors: government, city service providers, industry, and citizens. This transformation enables the deployment of disruptive information, mobility and safety services in the cities.<BR><BR>Author &amp; contact person: alvaro.delacruz@eitdigital.eu<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump intends to cap America's annual refugee admissions at a historic low , marking the administration's latest crackdown on immigrants from some of the world's most vulnerable groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A US state department report seen by the Guardian shows that the administration has briefed congress it will admit just 45,000 refugees in 2018, the lowest number requested by any president in over three decades and less than half the 110,000 cap issued in the last year of the Obama administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's a page from the State Dept report showing Trump will slash annuals refugee admissions to 45,000. The lowest any president has gone: pic.twitter.com/GhlNdN6NWj - Oliver Laughland (@oliverlaughland) September 27, 2017</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report references the president's travel ban that was issued in March that called for more stringent vetting of refugees, who already face strict security checks which can see processing take on average between 18-24 months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While maintaining the United States leadership role in humanitarian protection, an integral part of this mission is to ensure that refugee resettlement opportunities go only to those who are eligible for such protection and who do not present a risk to the safety and security of our country,&quot; the report states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Refugee admissions nearly halved as supreme court mulls Trump travel ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement comes just days after the president issued a series of indefinite travel restrictions for eight countries, the latest iteration of his travel ban, which critics argue deliberately targets Muslim travellers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1980 the White House has placed an annual ceiling on the number of refugees allowed into the US. The previous low, issued by Ronald Reagan in 1986, was 67,000 admissions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrant advocacy groups, many of whom assist in resettling refugees, condemned the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Resettlement is only an option in the most urgent refugee cases,&quot; said Betsy Fisher, policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project. &quot;It's hard to comprehend why the administration would move to limit resettlement, when the need is greater than ever. We are abandoning desperate people in life-or-death situations, including children with medical emergencies, US wartime allies, and survivors of torture.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move was also met with bipartisan criticism in congress. Republican senator Chuck Grassley and Democrat Dianne Feinstein said in a rare joint statement they were &quot;incredibly frustrated&quot; to have been told at the &quot;eleventh-hour&quot; of the administration's decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal law requires a cabinet official consult with congress before a ceiling is decided. But a meeting between lawmakers and secretary of state Rex Tillerson was only scheduled on Wednesday, just days before the start of the 2018 fiscal year in October when the cap will come into force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are incredibly frustrated that the annual consultation for refugee admissions, which is required by law, was finalized just one day in advance,&quot; the senators said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> House Democrats John Conyersand Zoe Lofgren described the move as &quot;an affront to the United States' legacy as a protector of oppressed people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Refugee program was created in the aftermath of world war two. At that time, we rightly rejected antisemitic ideology and embraced our role as a beacon of hope and freedom for those in need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They added: &quot;Since that time, US refugee protection has never been a partisan issue, nor a political one. Presidents from both parties have long recognized that the US refugee admissions program is essential to global stability and our reputation as a leader on the world stage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration's move comes at a time when the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) reports 65.6 million forcibly displaced people around the world, a total that has almost doubled in two decades, fuelled by conflicts in Syria, Yemen and South Sudan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Trump travel ban extended to blocks on North Korea, Venezuela and Chad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's announcement followed a fiery internal debate among White House advisers and administration officials, according to unnamed officials speaking to the New York Times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner, had argued for the cap to be lowered even further, to 15,000, while officials in the state and defense departments had recommended a cap of at least 50,000, the Times reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the 45,000 ceiling marks a historic low the United States has, in recent history, resettled far fewer refugees. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks the Bush administration allowed just 27,131 refugees into the country in 2002 even though the ceiling was set at 70,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, Trump used the first iteration of his travel ban to lower the Obama administration's cap from 110,000 to 50,000, but was prevented from implementing this after a series of federal courts blocked the president's order. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort to physically clear the camp - codenamed Operation Helpim Friends - began on Thursday with about 50 refugees and asylum seekers taken from the detention centre to other accommodation on Manus Island - most of which is not yet fully built, without running water, electricity or security fences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detention centre, where most of the refugees and asylum seekers have been held for more than four years was officially closed on 31 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  More than 300 men still in Manus detention centre after PNG attempt to move them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men who remained there, living without running water, food, and electricity for three weeks, have resisted going to other accommodation because they do not feel safe in Lorengau, after a series of violent attacks against refugees in the township, and because of a lack of services, especially health services, in the new centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian journalist and refugee Behrouz Boochani, who wastargeted and arrested by police on Thursday, and taken to Lorengau before being released without charge, continues to report from the island.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walid Zazai, who remains in the camp, said refugees and asylum seekers were not resisting or using violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-year history of the camp has been marked by violence. In February 2014, during riots when police and other outsiders stormed the detention centre, more than 70 asylum seekers were seriously injured, including having their throats slits with knives, as well as being shot with police weapons. Reza Barati was murdered by contractors who beat him with a nail-spiked stick and dropped a rock on his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, a mass hunger-strike ended with mobile squad police raiding the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Good Friday this year, drunken soldiers tried to crash a vehicle through the detention centre fence, and fired over 100 shots, including from an M16 assault rifle, at refugees inside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1127 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of the main arrival points for people seeking asylum in Europe, the Greek island of Lesbos is home for thousands of refugees who are being held by European authorities at the doors of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although supposedly a passing point, refugees are staying in Lesbos's camps for several months. As reported by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), recent changes in EU policies that have been preventing the entrance of refugees in Europe and restricting the criteria for identifying people as 'vulnerable' have led to vulnerable people not being identified as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given that certain medical conditions require tests and treatments that are not available on the Greek island, this shift in policy is of great concern to us as it clearly limits vulnerable people's timely access to much needed healthcare.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of resources and &quot;drastic deterioration of the care and protection for vulnerable people&quot; have led to extremely high levels of mental health symptoms amongst refugees, MSF reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many volunteers and organisations' work in camps and the opening of community centres, however, give a glimpse of hope to the lives of refugees stuck in such vulnerable situations. With many of the islanders being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for their solidarity, Lesbos has been home to a large number of artistic initiatives and communities helping refugees with their own projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Music, art, photography, craft making and a flash mob project have been growing from people's stories, struggles and energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violin lessons offer a welcome distraction for the children (Angels Relief Team)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently based in the camp of Kara Tepe, the initiative Angels Relief Team, which is part of the charitable organisation Art Bridges, is a volunteer-based organisation specialising in providing music and art education to sensitise children to artistic expression. Helping young refugees in the three main vulnerable communities in Lesbos and around Greece, they have been carrying out activities that range from instrument teaching, pottery workshops to design and sewing workshops to help them express their emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activities offer a chance to share their artistic expression, which promotes respect between children and their social integration, and has also reduced tensions amongst different ethnic groups that live in the communities. Angela Maria Arbel&aacute;ez, who founded the project with her daughter Mar&iacute;a Francisca Rocca, celebrated. &quot;These children do not longer see themselves as refugees, but restore self-confidence by becoming the protagonists of their own artistic expression&quot;, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arbel&aacute;ez is a fine art historian and her daughter a violinist and performance artist. They count on music teachers and pedagogues and have collaborated with numerous renowned artists from around the world, as well as received donations from many British, Irish and Spanish supporters amongst others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practises have been helping children recover the joy which was taken away by their past experiences, who paint with brighter and happier colours. &quot;It's lovely to see again joy in some of the pictures&quot;, Maria Magee, ART volunteer told TakePart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creativity is bringing back the energy amongst refugees and their children, particularly, which has significantly improved the daily experiences in the camps. &quot;We have identified as many as about 2,000 minors who have benefited from the creative activities. We worked with a group of children who came here scared, with a stooped posture. You can now see their smiles returning to their faces and how their little bodies have regained self-confidence,&quot; Arbel&aacute;ez s'Art offers a chance to enter a magic space to dream, imagine... they can draw the house they would like to live in'aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Art offers a chance to enter a magic space to dream, imagine... they can draw the house they would like to live in' (Angels Relief Team)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesvos Solidarity, an open refugee camp based in the island, also offers creative activities engaging with refugees by singing, painting or craft making, and runs the MOSAIK support centre together with the NGO Borderline-Europe. The centre has provided cultural awareness events, choirs, theatre groups and upcycling and weaving workshops, providing dignity to a life of waiting that being at the limbo of Europe entitles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amine arrived with 90 per cent of her body burnt after fleeing her home in Aleppo, Syria. This affected her severely. She was shy, distressed and uncomfortable in her own skin,&quot; Arbel&aacute;ez said. Sharing moments with other children, she said, promoted mutual respect, and she became much more active and happier. &quot;She recovered part of her self-esteem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As reported by TakePart, refugee families are seeing the creativity bringing happiness to their children: &quot;now that they have the violin, the music, my children are very happy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bobby Loyd, visual artist and HCPC registered art therapist at Art Refuge UK, who is currently working with vulnerable people in Calais, stressed the importance of the safe space art offers to refugees. &quot;They are treated as 'other', as different, as criminals. Art offers them a chance to feel heard, witnessed, and allows them to enter a magic space to dream, imagine... they can draw the house they would like to live in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are not trained art therapists, but volunteers in refugee camps promoting art amongst refugees to facilitate the expression of feelings and emotions that might be held back and not easily verbalised. &quot;We don't ask them, we just let them express themselves as they wish, because it's the process of the arts that is very important,&quot; Emelda Graham, volunteer teacher at Pikpa Camp told TakePart. According to MOSAIK, humanitarian aid has provided assistance &quot;necessary for people to survive, but not, in the words of some refugees, 'to remain human'&quot;. Creative activities have helped children and adults find a space of security in their limbic situations in refugee camps. &quot;We are passionate about these initiatives&quot;, Loyd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers promote art to aid the expression of feelings that might be held back (ART angels relief team)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The island has also attracted a number of art initiatives that aim at raising awareness of the precarious situations that refugees are stuck in. Amnesty International organised last week, together with Lesvos Solidarity, a flash mob as a protest to the EU-Turkey deal, which has since 2016 trapped refugees on the Greek islands and prevented them from accessing the European continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The famous Chinese artist Ai Wei Wei also set up his art studio in the island last year to raise awareness about the refugee crisis through a photography-based art project. &quot;As an artist, I have to relate to humanity's struggles... I never separate these situations from my art,&quot; Wei Wei told the </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Rohingya man who won his case over the absolute ban on asylum seekers working is challenging the Minister for Justice's refusal to let his wife join him here, writes &lt;strong&gt;Ann O'Loughlin&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man has also applied to have his two children, who are in an orphanage in Bangladesh, join him here under the family reunification scheme but that application has yet to be decided.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the persecuted Rohingya minority in Myanmar, the man spent eight years in direct provision before getting refugee status here in September 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last May, the Supreme Court upheld his claim that the ban preventing asylum seekers working before their status is decided is unconstitutional. The court has said it will make a formal declaration to that effect next February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After getting refugee status, the man applied last March for permission to have his wife, whom he married last January in Bangladesh; his two children by his first wife, who died in 2010; and his brother, join him here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 16, the Minister refused permission for his wife on grounds Section 56.9 of the International Protection Act 2015 requires, before a spouse can join a refugee here, the refugee must be married at the time they seek protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man and his wife are challenging that refusal and a hearing date will be fixed later for their case, taken against the Minister, the Attorney General and Ireland. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is a notice party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now in his late thirties, the man arrived here on July 16, 2008, applied for refugee status the following day, and got refugee status on September 19, 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he has two children, one born in 2003 and the second in 2005, by his first wife who died in 2010 after a serious illness. Both children are in an orphanage in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he married his second wife last January and they lived at her home in Bangladesh until he returned to Ireland in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister has acknowledged receipt of the family reunification application concerning his children, which is still being processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, on May 16, the Minister, informed him, because his wife did not meet the definition of a member of his family under Section 56.9, the application for family reunification in respect of her was refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That refusal, it is claimed, breaches various rights of the man, including his family and private life rights under the Constitution, European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. He is also seeking, if necessary, various declarations including that Section 56.9.a is repugnant to the Constitution and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claims, from 2008, when he first sought refugee status and 2016, when he got it, the right to family reunification was governed by section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Section 18, a refugee's spouse fell within the definition of a family member provided the marriage existed when the application for family reunification, rather than protection status, was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 56.9 changed that criterion to require the marriage existed when the refugee applied for protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man claims the 2015 Act establishes the procedure, and criteria, by which a refugee applies for family reunification but it is unclear if a declared refugee can apply under the alternative administrative arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also says, because he was banned from working for eight years until he got refugee status, he cannot meet the minimum financial threshold applicable to family reunification for non-nationals lawfully residing in the State -  30,000 in each of the last two years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tense stand-off was under way in Papua New Guinea today as the Pacific island's military prepared to cut water and electricity to a camp where Australia has detained hundreds of refugees for years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army is preparing to take over the camp - established by Australia on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island - as their own deadline approached this evening for 600 refugees to move into towns on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is feared that the migrants will be attacked by angry locals who resent their presence. Most of the refugees have refused to leave ahead of expected violence. A Human Rights Watch report last week found that some refugees had been stabbed and robbed in the town while trying to visit the supermarket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Papua New Guinea government has warned all electricity, drinking water and food supplies will be cut to the refugee detention centre this evening and that the military will take over the site and force the refugees out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp is one of two in the Pacific where Australia detains refugees. Canberra does not allow asylum seekers who flee their home nation by boat to set foot in Australia. Papua New Guinea has agreed to host the centre since 2012 in return for hundreds of millions in extra aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planned closure of the Manus Island centre follows a Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ruling in April last year that Australia's detention of refugees and asylum seekers there was illegal and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is adamant that, despite the ruling, the 600 men within the centre will never be allowed into the country. Canberra argues that it has adopted such a policy to discourage people traffickers. Those held on Manus Island are mostly Iranians but also include people from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Burma. Some of them have been held there for five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's refugee agency has urged Australia to avert a humanitarian emergency over the closure of its detention centre in Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several refugees have said that Manus locals wielding machetes had broken into the centre and were looting equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imran Mohammed, a Rohingyan refugee, was reported as saying that Manus Islanders had taken fans, chairs, tables, and rubbish bins after it was abandoned by security guards and other staff this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power and water was due to be cut off at 5pm, with authorities insisting the 600 men remaining at the centre move to the nearby town of Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick McKim, the Australian Greens senator who is visiting Manus Island, said the closure of the centre and departure of all staff had left the refugees at the mercy of the Papua New Guinea military with no food or drinking water. He said that 100 local residents had taken to the streets in Lorengau this morning demanding refugees be sent to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Lomai, a Papua New Guinea lawyer who represented the men detained on Manus, was due to seek an urgent court order that food, water and electricity be provided to those in the centre after today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia and Papua New Guinea have both denied ultimate responsibility for the safety of the men who remain inside the refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection said today the centre's closure and the &quot;management&quot; of the men at the centre were matters for Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahmoud is a Syrian of Palestinian heritage who fled the war in Aleppo in 2014 after being imprisoned and tortured by government forces. He is now a guide with Querstadtein, a group organising tours of Berlin, led by refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tours use the context of Berlin's urban landscape to explain to tourists and locals alike the experience of being a refugee in Germany. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Querstadtein, which now has eight guides, was the second refugee tour to crop up in Berlin as the city reacted to the mass influx of migrants that began two years ago. Refugee Voices was co-founded in early 2015 by Lorna Cannon, a British tour guide living in Berlin, and her two friends, both refugees who now volunteer as guides. The tours are a way for &quot;people to meet somebody who is experiencing this life as a refugee, and understand what that means&quot;, Cannon says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea is catching on. Refugee Voices has since launched a tour in Copenhagen, run by an Eritrean woman and an Iraqi Kurd, and there are plans to spread to London and Paris in early 2018. It is volunteer-based and free. Querstadtein 's concept is similar, but it pays guides a wage of (EURO)200 a month and charges (EURO)13 per tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cobbled streets of Neuk&ouml;lln, one of Berlin's most diverse districts, hold a special significance for Mahmoud. &quot;When you talk about the refugee crisis, then you have to talk about meeting points for these people,&quot; he says. &quot;There are always difficulties regarding the procedures and the linguistic barriers when you first arrive. So you have to find a person or place who can help you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In AfD areas, some refugees are afraid to leave the shelter after dark ... or be visibly identifiable as a Muslim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dr Sina Arnold    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For him, that was Neuk&ouml;lln. More than 40% of the neighbourhood's residents have an immigrant background, and it is &quot;one of most energetic areas in Berlin&quot;, he says. &quot;It's the most demanded area for living, simply because it's full of foreigners. If you are a migrant or come from outside of Berlin, you can find comfort here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby Sonnenallee is a large thoroughfare bustling with loud shoppers and the hum of traffic. The street, once bisected by the Berlin wall, now represents a different kind of segregation. Home to Lebanese immigrants in the 1970s, Sonnenallee has become a hub for the city's Middle Eastern communities, and is known locally as &quot;Arab Street&quot;. &quot;This is the meeting point for all refugees and Arabs in the city. It makes them feel at home,&quot; says Mahmoud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cafe Sabah, just off the main road, Mahmoud calls for tea and coffee and jokes with the staff in Arabic. I ask if he knows them. &quot;Can you believe that we're related? He's my cousin,&quot; he laughs. &quot;Arabs are overly sociable. That person I got to know is the grandson of the cousin of my grandmother. I had never met him before in Syria, even though I knew his father. But here we got to know that he's a relative of mine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since more than a million refugees crossed Germany's borders, the city's ethnic makeup has changed: Syrians are now the fourth-largest group of foreigners, behind Turks, Poles and Italians. New, refugee-owned businesses, such as the restaurants Alagami and Yasmin Alsham, have opened up as these new communities gradually establish themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's easy to say, 'Ich bin ein Berliner.' It's a very multicultural place - you feel like it's your city,&quot; says Mahmoud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Berlin may be multicultural, it remains polarised. The diverse areas of Neuk&ouml;lln and Kreuzberg are a far cry from the far-right hotbeds of Marzahn-Hellersdorf, which are &quot;no-go areas for refugees who look visibly 'different'&quot;, says Dr Sina Arnold, a researcher at the Berlin Institute for Migration. &quot;It creates a climate of fear for people who thought they had arrived in a safe place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These fears have become even more prominent in the wake of September's federal elections, when the far-right AfD won 12.6% of the vote. In the districts where AfD increased its share, &quot;there is generally only a small percentage of migrant population, which also results in a lack of solidarity structures for refugees and migrants&quot;, Arnold says. &quot;It means that some refugees are afraid to leave the shelter after dark, or to walk outside alone, or be visibly identifiable as a Muslim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were around 3,500 attacks on refugees or refugee shelters in  Germany in 2016. Arnold witnessed an assault in March last year in Marzhan, when a man poured vodka on a young Syrian, spat on him and gave a Nazi salute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If people understand the context and history of refugees, they will deal with them differently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Walid    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walid, a guide with Refugee Voices who asked for his name to be changed, says he's afraid of what might happen. &quot;[The far right] are getting more powerful; lots of people are believing them and starting to be more afraid,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tours aim to offer a space for reconciliation, with the guides hoping that presenting their own views and experiences of Berlin will help cross the barriers of perceived &quot;otherness&quot;. &quot;It's really rare to find a normal way of interacting, because people have a stereotype,&quot; Walid adds. &quot;There's a huge misunderstanding of what a refugee is. If people understand the context and history of what made people come here, they will start to deal with them differently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do the tours also risk becoming what the Germans call Elendstourismus, or &quot;misery tourism&quot;? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I felt that people were giving that sense of 'poor people', I wouldn't continue,&quot; says Mohamad, co-founder of Refugee Voices. &quot;This is not the point of the tour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he says, it is about forming a connection between experiences. Outside Berlin's finance ministry on the corner of Leipziger Stra&szlig;e, Walid describes the June 1953 demonstrations here that were brutally suppressed by Soviet forces. Hundreds of people died &quot;just asking for their basic rights&quot;, Walid says. In Leipziger Stra&szlig;e's scarred buildings Walid sees the streets of Hama, Syria, where half a million people gathered to protest against the government in 2011, an uprising that was violently crushed. &quot;It's a similar story of people trying to get their freedom, their rights, what they should have,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walid left Syria with his brother Mohamad, also a guide with Refugee Voices, after he was blacklisted by the Assad government for being active on social media. &quot;We got a tip from somebody that his name was on a list that if the government catches him at any checkpoint it will be very bad for him,&quot; his brother says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The party city grows up: how Berlin's clubbers built their own urban village</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arriving in Berlin, they stayed in a student dorm in Lichtenberg in the east of the city, which was converted into a temporary refugee shelter. While this area, like Marzhan, has a reputation for hostility to foreigners, Walid says the main problem was being in the limbo of shelters, not having your own place to live and socialise. &quot;It's hard to settle if you're being moved to another camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He eventually found a home in Wedding, a few U-Bahn stops north of the city centre, where he ends his tour at his favourite family-run Syrian restaurant, Mandi. &quot;Berlin gives me hope,&quot; says Walid. &quot;This city was heavily damaged in the second world war, and in a few years it was rebuilt and there was democracy. That's what gives me hope for Syria now: that one day we might be able to build it again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, a number of children's books authors, moved by these images and other news reports, are taking on the subject in fiction to humanise and personalise the ongoing conflict for young readers. More than a dozen new and forthcoming titles feature young Muslim refugees as protagonists, ranging from picture books aimed at readers as young as fourto a cluster of novels for teenagersthat delve into the murkier aspects of the refugee crisis. Some of the books touch on challenging issues such asthe rise of Isisand the sectarian rift between Sunnis and Shias.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Alan Gratz's novel </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, for eight to 12-year-olds, a young boy named Mahmoud Bishara flees the violence in Aleppo after his family's home is destroyed, and has to contend with smugglers and militants as his family charts a treacherous course through Turkey and across the Mediterranean to Europe. His younger brother, Waleed-based on Omran Daqneesh, the Syrian boy famously photographed after the bombing -is too traumatised to even cry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to make individual refugees visible and turn statistics into names and faces that kids could relate to,&quot; Gratz says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wave of children's books about Muslim asylum seekers is arriving amid the worst refugee crisis the world has seen since World War II, as millions of civilians -many of them children -flee the wars and insurgencies in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The Syrian civil war alone has uprooted more than two million children, according to Unicef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really important to engage children with the world as it is, and the world right now is a very complicated place,&quot; said Zareen Jaffery, executive editor of Salaam Reads, a Muslim-themed children's imprint at Simon &amp; Schuster.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lines We Cross</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a young adult novel by Randa Abdel-Fattah released by Scholastic in May, centres on a teenage Muslim refugee from Afghanistan who is accosted by Islamophobes and nationalists in Australia, where her family runs a restaurant. The girl, Mina, develops a crush on a boy whose parents are anti-immigration, anti-Muslim activists. &quot;In a political environment where there's such a demonisation of refugees, I wanted readers to understand what their lives are like,&quot; says Abdel-Fattah, who lives in Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gratz says that he expected a book like </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an unflinching and sympathetic look at people whose lives are upended by war and oppression, might repel some readers. &quot;There certainly will be people who will assume that I wrote it to push an agenda,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which Scholastic released in late July with a first printing of more than 200,000 copies, originally began as a novel about the StLouis, a German ocean liner carrying nearly 1,000 Jews fleeing Hitler during World War II. The ship was turned away from Cuba and the United States and returned to Europe, where many of the passengers died in the war. Gratz saw disturbing parallels between the historical episode he was researching and the current plight of Syrian refugees, and decided to weave together the stories of three children: a Jewish boy whose family tries to escape Nazi Germany on the StLouis; a Cuban girl who leaves Havana in a raft during theisland's food shortages in 1994, and Mahmoud, the Syrian boy whose family escapes to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he finished the novel this year, Gratz added an author's note that addresses President Trump's travel ban, and says that the United States has accepted less than one percent of the roughly five million refugees who have fled Syria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers and librarians have embraced these titles as a way to explain the refugee crisis to children, and Gratz has been invited to speak at more than 40 schools around America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mollee Holloman, an elementary school librarian in Manteo, North Carolina, who helped organise a recent book signing for Gratz that drew around 80 children, said she hoped </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada, where more than 33,000 Syrians resettled in 2016, picture books featuring Syrian refugee characters are being used in some public schools to explain the crisis and give students perspective on what some arriving Syrian students might have been through.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy rain failed to dampen the spirits of the fifty protestors who stopped traffic along Commercial Road, as they marched a circular route through the town centre from Wharf Green.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration, which was organised by the Swindon People's Assembly but attended by a range of local groups, is the third of its kind in Swindon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Chris Humphreys (@Adver_Chris) July 22, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was called to raise awareness of the positive contribution of refugees and asylum seekers to the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organiser Kate Linnegar, 56, of Swindon People's Assembly, said: &quot;We're hoping to promote a positive attitude towards visitors to our community. We realise they are a positive for our community and our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know there is a lot of anger [towards refugees] and we want to counter that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think that people are suffering because of the austerity cuts - and refugees and others have been made into scapegoats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year more than 100 people turned out for the march - making it one of the best attended political events in Swindon for several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kate said: &quot;We were hoping to have a hundred today. But the weather may have put people off coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joining the Swindon People's Assembly on the march were local groups like the Green Party and Swindon City of Sanctuary, which supports refugees and asylum seekers in the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swindon City of Sanctuary's Shareen Campbell, 60, said: &quot;It was fantastic to see so many people turn out to show solidarity with people all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very important that we show the refugees that they are welcome here. And the refugees I know do generally feel welcome here. A lot of people in Swindon are friendly on a one-to-one level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swindon is one of four towns in the south west designated by government as &quot;dispersal&quot; towns. Around 200 asylum seekers are housed in Swindon while the Home Office considers their claim. While they are housed here, the refugees are given &pound;5 a day on which to live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradley Williams, 19, of Swindon Young Greens and one of those attending the march, said: &quot;I think it [the plight of refugees] should matter to anyone with a heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to think that if, God forbid, anything should happen in this country, I would make it out to a safe country with my family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Kimber, 59, is secretary of Swindon Green Party - but also volunteers with the Harbour Project, a charity that supports refugees and asylum seekers in Swindon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've become more and more active [in refugee politics] since working with Harbour,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm working with people there who are qualified clinical psychiatrists. These people could be contributing so much more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former headteacher Julia Arkell, 78, said that her childhood friend's parents had escaped Nazi Germany: &quot;My best friend, Susie, was the daughter of refugees from Nazi Germany. Her mother was a Jewess and her father was a communist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marcher Julia, who said that as a teacher she had never had a class composed entirely of British children, added: &quot;I was brought up to realise that everyone was a human being.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marchers, who met in Wharf Green, attracted some interest from passers-by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One, 21-year-old student Jacob Badcock, was supportive of the march. He said: &quot;It's not something you see very often in Swindon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others shouted criticism at the marchers, saying that the government was wrong to support refugees and suggesting that funding should support British-born homeless. One man, Daniel, who said he had spent time living on the streets and has struggled to get a job, said: &quot;It's ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tense and potentially bloody stand-off was building today on a remote Pacific island as the Papua New Guinea military prepared to cut water and power to a camp where Australia has detained hundreds of refugees for years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soldiers were readying to take over the refugee camp - established by Australia on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island - as deadline approached this evening for 600 refugees to move into towns on the island amid grave fears they will be immediately attacked by angry locals who resent their presence. Most are refusing to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Papua New Guinea government has warned all electricity, drinking water and food supplies would be cut to the refugee detention centre and that its military would take over the site and force the refugees out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp is one of two in the Pacific where Australia detains refugees and asylum seekers in keeping with its controversial policy that displaced people fleeing their nations by boat never be allowed to set foot in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight's planned closure follows a Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ruling in April last year that Australia's detention of refugees and asylum seekers there was illegal and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the ruling, Australia is adamant that the 600 men within the centre will never be allowed into Australia - a policy is argues in necessary to discourage people smugglers. Those held on Manus Island are mostly Iranians but also include people from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Burma and other nations. Some have been held there for five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's refugee agency has urged Australia to avert a humanitarian emergency over the closure of its detention centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahead of the deadline for the men to leave the centre, several refugees said Manus Island locals, some wielding machetes, had breached the centre's main gate and were looting equipment from guard houses and other areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imran Mohammed, a Rohingyan refugee, told Australia's Fairfax Media that Manus islanders had taken fans, chairs, tables, rubbish bins and other items from the site after it was abandoned by security guards and other staff on Tuesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power and water was due to be cut off at 5pm, with authorities insisting the 600 men remaining at the centre move to the nearby town of Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian Greens senator Nick McKim, who is on Manus Island, said the closure of the centre and departure of all staff had left the refugees at the mercy of the Papua New Guinea military with no food or drinking water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told Fairfax Media about 100 locals had rallied in the nearby town of Lorengau this morning, demanding the refugees to be sent to Australia and not brought into their community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Lomai, a lawyer, who in a previous Supreme Court challenge represented the men detained on Manus, was due to seek an urgent court order that food, water and electricity be provided to those in the centre beyond Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia and Papua New Guinea have both denied ultimate responsibility for the safety of the hundreds of men who remain inside the refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeman for Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection said the centre's closure and the &quot;management&quot; of the men at the centre were matters for Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday Papua New Guinea's Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas said the men were Australia's responsibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi and World Bank Group Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva World Bank/ Brandon Payne.<BR><BR>The World Bank Group (WBG) and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are joining forces to establish a joint data center on forced displacement to greatly improve statistics on refugees, other displaced people and host communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new center, announced today, will enable a better informed and more sustainable response to forced displacement, underpinning a coordinated humanitarian-development approach. It builds on UNHCR's role as the reference institution for refugee data, bringing in the WBG's analytical expertise and experience helping national governments improve statistical capacity.<BR><BR>'The scale, complexity and speed of today's refugee crises mean we can no longer afford to respond through humanitarian action alone. It is more important than ever to mobilize resources and plan for the longer term from the beginning. This is why early access to reliable data for development partners like the World Bank is so important,' said United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.<BR><BR>'When resources are scarce all efforts should be made to get help to those who need it. Improving data and evidence is critical to ensure that these resources are used efficiently and effectively. We have much to learn from UNHCR's experience, so that we can do more together working in complementary ways to help both refugees and their hosts,' said World Bank Group Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva.<BR><BR>With almost 90% of refugees living in the developing world, and more than half displaced for over 4 years, there is recognition by the international community that humanitarian interventions need to be complemented by a longer-term development response.<BR><BR>UNHCR and the WBG have been strengthening collaboration under this new approach, which is reflected in ongoing efforts to develop a global compact on refugees for adoption by the end of 2018. Delivering such a comprehensive response requires high-quality, timely data, which was also underscored in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants of September 2016. Global-level data defines the international agenda, while country-level data informs policies and helps to target aid resources appropriately. More needs to be done to strengthen the collection, quality, access, and use of data.<BR><BR>The new data center will cover refugees, internally displaced persons and other groups as well as host communities. It aims to:<BR><BR>Ensure population and socioeconomic data are systematically collected and analyzed<BR><BR>Facilitate open access to forced displacement data, while ensuring the integrity of the legal protection framework<BR><BR>Promote innovations to enhance forced displacement data through satellite imagery, cell phones, and other new technologies<BR><BR>Strengthen the global data collection system, establishing common norms, definitions, and methodologies, and support efforts to fortify country systems where necessary.<BR><BR>The potential impact of enhanced cooperation between the WBG and UNHCR is significant. For example, detailed data, where they were available, enabled the two institutions to prepare landmark reports on the welfare of Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan, which in turn led to a better targeting of humanitarian assistance as well as the preparation of development projects. In Kenya, it made possible a detailed analysis of the role of the Kakuma refugee camp in the local economy, demonstrating that the presence of refugees had a positive effect overall on economic growth in Northeast Kenya.<BR><BR>Systematically making data available will allow for a dramatic scaling up of such critical analytical work, which is essential as the WBG and UNHCR collaborate to support both refugees and host communities. Evidence-based information will also be available for use by practitioners and policy makers to improve programs and projects on forced displacement.<BR><BR>The data center is expected to be ready for operation in mid-2018.<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of South Sudanese refugees seeking shelter in Uganda has now topped one million - equivalent to the entire populations of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee suddenly descending on a country with nothing but the shoes they were able to run with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've spent the last three months in Uganda with Oxfam witnessing how this small country has responded in solidarity to the increasing number of refugees in need of support. In the face of muted indifference from the international community, its efforts have been remarkable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike many other countries hosting large numbers of refugees, Uganda hasn't herded people into refugee camps. Instead, refugees are registered at the border and transported to settlements where they are given a hot meal and a space to sleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Settlements give people space, in time to set up home and start to grow food to eat, living closely with the local community and at times sharing access to resources such as water, schools and health centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what's particularly admirable is that Uganda, with the help of  organisations including Oxfam, has continued to welcome refugees, despite being far from a rich country itself and despite the woeful underfunding of the international aid effort. The Ugandan Government recently appealed for $2 billion to meet the humanitarian and development needs of all refugees in the country. Less than a quarter of that amount was pledged and the UN's own appeal for South Sudanese refugees in the country is just 17 per cent funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Uganda has kept the door open to what has become the third-largest population of refugees in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority of those arriving (86 per cent) are women and children. Their stories are shocking. One of the women Oxfam is helping, Amina, had lost six family members, including her brothers, when the violence arrived in her village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So she did what any mother would do in her situation - she took her children and ran, escaping first to Congo and then on to Uganda where she arrived earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the panic and confusion, Amina became separated from two of her children, aged 8 and 12. She arrived in Uganda without them, sick with worry. Amina searched high and low, in all of the reception centres built to help process refugees, and throughout settlements where refugees live. But she couldn't find them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amina told us: &quot;I was not eating well for the last nine months, I was growing thin. I was not eating, thinking a lot about my brothers that were killed and my missing husband and also my children are nowhere to be seen. I didn't know if they were dead or alive. What do I do? I was going through a lot on my mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then, after months of worrying and waiting, those moments of joy came. One of Amina's children was found in a neighbouring town. And the day before Oxfam met Amina, her other child was found in Imvepi refugee settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to describe the overwhelming sense of relief Amina must have felt. She simply told us: &quot;When I saw my child yesterday I was very, very happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During my time in Uganda, I heard many stories similar to Amina's, of families who had been separated during their search for safety. Of people having to flee their villages at a moment's notice, desperately seeking safety. I heard again and again of the worry and the pain it caused them. Of the sleepless nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this isn't just happening in Uganda. In my home town of Glasgow, refugees have been parted from their families too. Take Adnan, for example. He found safety in Glasgow after being forced to flee Syria, but harsh, complicated UK rules meant it was difficult for him to bring his wife and children to join him, and he still fears for the safety of his brother and sister in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amina and Adnan faced the same pain of separation, and the same eventual elation at being reunited with their loved ones. Ultimately, what people like Amina and Adnan need more than anything is peace at home. As long as the senseless, costly and brutal wars in South Sudan, Syria and elsewhere continue, people will continue to flee to find safety, food, water and shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's vital the international community honour their commitments to get South Sudan's warring parties back to the negotiating table, and it's vital that the financial support to Uganda's refugee response is urgently scaled up. But there are other steps the international community can take to make a difference to refugees' lives, and to show solidarity with countries like Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March next year the UK Government will be presented with a golden opportunity to do just that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil is bringing a Private Member's Bill which would give many more refugees the chance to be reunited with their families here in the UK: a chance to spread the joy and relief felt by people like Amina and Adnan when they were reunited with their loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries and communities, must work together to find solutions to the global refugee crisis, we can make a difference and the UK must play its role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This crisis was caused by people. It can be solved by people too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actor blasted Australia's handling of the centre this week, calling it a 'nation's shame'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Thursday, a&nbsp;spokeswoman for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton asked&nbsp; The Australian &nbsp;how the actor expected to carry out his offer, considering current immigration policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'How does he anticipate he will resettle refugees without the necessary visas?' she said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a series of tweets, Crowe called out the government's handling of Manus Island after the detention centre was officially closed on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Manus. A Nations shame. Lives held in limbo. Lives lived in fear &amp; despair. It's f***ing disgraceful,' the actor tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 600 asylum seekers and refugees barricaded themselves inside the complex in Papua New Guinea.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a response to a Twitter user who responded to the actor by writing 'maybe you could put them up somewhere if you're so ashamed,' Crowe offered to support the refugees himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I've thought about this,' he told the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: 'I believe I could house and find jobs for 6. I'm sure there'd be other Australians who would do the same.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has confirmed an offer to take 150 refugees from Australia's offshore detention centres still stands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Ardern will discuss the Manus Island stand-off with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull when they meet in Sydney on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think anyone would look at a situation like that and see the human face,' Ms Ardern said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am looking forward to having a conversation directly with the prime minister on Sunday about some of those issues, and New Zealand's role in and view on Manus Island in particular.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand's refugee resettlement offer was made by the Key government in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been rejected several times on the grounds that it would give refugees a backdoor into Australia and become a marketing opportunity for people smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani, who is among those on Manus Island, says 'the place is like a war zone'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detainees spent Wednesday night digging for water, while others kept watch to protect the camp in case of attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Last night the refugees were in a dark place. People were lying down on the floor and were struggling with serious hunger, having not eaten since Tuesday,' Mr Boochani told the AAP from Manus Island on Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I want to close Manus Island as quickly as possible. It doesn't help when you have got the Greens telling people not to engage and move. It makes a difficult situation even worse.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">688 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Kolkata's leading English daily The Telegraph, part of the ABP group, on 23 September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Delhi: The Rohingya Muslims today told the Supreme Court that the Centre could deport any refugees against whom it has evidence of terror links, but not all the estimated 40,000 settlers merely because of their religion as doing so would be discriminatory and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a counter-affidavit filed in response to the Centre's position that sections of the Rohingya settlers had links with terror groups in Pakistan, the Islamic State and Pakistani spy agency ISI, Mohammed Salimullah - one of the petitioners who has challenged the deportation plan - alleged that the government was adopting a discriminatory stand towards the community while welcoming refugees from other religions facing persecution in Bangladesh and Pakistan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is some credible evidence or information that any members of the Rohingya community/refugees are involved in any activity that would harm the national security interests of India, those individuals may either be dealt with in accordance with Indian laws or can be refused refugee status under the exclusion clause of the (UN) 1951 Refugee Convention,&quot; the affidavit says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mere social, religious or political origin of the Rohingya refugees cannot amount to reasonable grounds under the 'exclusion clause' for considering that they pose a danger to the security of India...there cannot be a general assumption that the entire Rohingya refugee community in India is involved in militancy-related activities,&quot; the affidavit adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case of Sri Lankan refugees, the government had put in place a screening mechanism to identify those associated with the LTTE - which New Delhi had declared a terrorist organization - or with a criminal record and had put them in special camps, the affidavit pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large number of Rohingya Muslims are peace-loving and have no criminal links, much less ties to any 'terrorist activity', the affidavit says and contends that any summary deportation would put thousands of innocent refugees from the community in grave danger in Buddhist-dominated Myanmar where they will be subjected to torture and even death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unlike the people of India who have been treating the community and its members with compassion and consideration, the Burmese army has been totally inimical to the Rohingya Muslims, having a long history of killing and torturing the members and of setting aflame their homes in the Rakhine state of Myanmar,&quot; the affidavit said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affidavit described as discriminatory a September 2015 Indian government notification granting exemption to certain classes of foreigners from provisions of the Foreigners Order, 1948, and passport rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a clause of the notification, minority communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan - namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians - compelled to seek shelter in India because of religious persecution or fear of it on or before December 31, 2014, were granted refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government's 2015 notification...is conspicuous by the absence of Muslims in the list of those being granted exemption. To exclude Muslim refugees from the Rohingya community in Myanmar that fled persecution is clearly discriminatory. (The Indian Constitution's) Article 14 (equality), unlike Article 19 (free speech and movement), is not confined only to citizens....non-inclusion of Muslims in the exemption is, hence, discriminatory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the affidavit, attacks and State-orchestrated violence in Myanmar have not been restricted to the Muslim Rohingyas as several Hindus who fled the ethnic persecution there are also among the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are, thus, entitled to protection under various international conventions which India has signed and ratified, which mention the principle of non-refoulement, and various resolutions of the UN, even though India has not signed the Refugee Convention of 1951,&quot; affidavit added. Non-refoulement is the principle of not sending back refugees to a country where they face persecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO Welsh councils have accepted no refugees over the past year, new figures have revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a freedom of information request to all 22 Welsh local authorities, both Merthyr Tydfil and Neath Porth Talbot councils admitted they did not take in any refugees over the past 12 months for which they have data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other 20 council areas all took in refugees. The local authority which resettled the highest number was Carmarthenshire with 51, all from Syria, followed by Swansea with 33 from Sudan, Afghanistan and Syria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In total at least 325 refugees have been taken in by councils in Wales over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contacted about the figure, a spokesman for Neath Port Talbot council said the local authority was &quot;amongst the first in Wales to play its part in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Syria, making an early commitment to settle 10 families within the county borough&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;Working closely alongside British Red Cross and local partners the council has fulfilled that commitment, delivering the resettlement programme locally and providing the necessary support to the families since their arrival in late 2015 and early 2016.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Merthyr Tydfil council spokesman said: &quot;When the Syrian Resettlement Programme was first &raquo; turn to page 4 introduced the authority entered into a collaborative arrangement with a neighbouring authority that resulted in two families coming to Merthyr Tydfil in June and August of 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our neighbouring authority also received families and due to the workload, understandably, the resource was dedicated to that authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An officer from Merthyr Tydfil council was identified and provided guidance on the Syrian Resettlement Programme to support the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However the two families relocated themselves outside of Merthyr Tydfil county borough and therefore under the Syrian Resettlement Programme they were no longer afforded support from Home Office funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Merthyr Tydfil council officer retired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current financial position is challenging and the allocation of resources has had to be balanced with the experience this authority has had of families relocating to other areas within a relatively short period of arriving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our ongoing participation therefore remains under review.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirsty Davies-Warner, head of Oxfam Cymru, said the charity was &quot;pleased&quot; with how Wales has responded to the refugee crisis to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Since 2015, when we first called on Wales to resettle Syrian refugees, each local authority has done so. The majority of which had no previous experience of resettlement and have since gone above and beyond, taking in more people than they originally pledged to resettle which just goes to show how much can be achieved when the will is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, we know that the need for resettlement is now greater than ever - last year 20 people were forced to flee their home every minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a key challenge of our time and as a globally responsible nation Wales needs to maintain the momentum by continuing to offer resettlement places to vulnerable refugees and ensure that accessible and appropriate support and services are available to both asylum seekers and refugees when they arrive.&quot; It comes after the British Red Cross warned refugees across Wales were being placed in &quot;desperate and degrading situations&quot; as the charity called on the UK and Welsh Governments to do more to help destitute refugees in Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refugees HOMED BY LOCAL AUTHORITY Number of refugees taken in by local authority (Dec 2016-Nov 2017 unless otherwise stated) &brvbar; Blaenau Gwent: Five from Bulaq, Egypt, between November 2016 and October 2017. &brvbar; Bridgend: 31 from Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&brvbar; Caerphilly: The local authority specified it has not &quot;taken in&quot; or &quot;accepted&quot; refugees but has &quot;assisted the settlement&quot; of 10 individuals from two families during the past 12 months.

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">559 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of South Sudanese refugees sheltering in Uganda has reached one million, the United Nations said, in a grim milestone for what has become the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan officials said they are overwhelmed by the flow of people fleeing South Sudan's civil war and the UN refugee agency urged the international community to donate more for humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An average of 1,800 South Sudanese citizens have been arriving daily in Uganda over the past 12 months, the UNHCR said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another one million or more South Sudanese are sheltering in Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Congo and Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people fleeing jumped after deadly fighting again erupted in South Sudan's capital Juba in July 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With refugees still arriving in their thousands, the amount of aid we are able to deliver is increasingly falling short.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fundraising summit hosted by Uganda in June raised only a fraction of the two billion dollars (&pound;1.5 billion) that Ugandan officials have said is needed to sufficiently look after the refugees and the communities hosting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This unhappy 1-million milestone must serve as a wake-up call to the international community that much more is needed from them,&quot; Sarah Jackson, an Amnesty International official in the region, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With no resolution to the conflict in South Sudan in sight, refugees will continue to flee to Uganda and the humanitarian crisis will only escalate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the refugees are women and children fleeing violence, often along ethnic lines, since the world's newest country erupted into violence in December 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan refugee officials have repeatedly warned the influx is straining the country's ability to be generous to the refugees, who are often given small plots of land for building temporary shelters and planting crops when they arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest of the settlements hosting refugees from South Sudan, Bidi Bidi, is roughly 230 square kilometres (88.8 square miles).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme cut food rations for some refugees amid funding shortages in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN says at least 674 million dollars (&pound;523 million) is needed to support South Sudanese refugees in Uganda this year, although only a fifth of that amount has been received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money is needed to provide basic services, including stocking clinics with medicines and putting up schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies say classroom sizes in the few available schools often exceed 200 pupils, and other children have dropped out because the nearest schools are located miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The funding shortfall in Uganda is now significantly impacting the abilities to deliver life-saving aid and key basic services,&quot; the UNHCR statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting persists in parts of South Sudan despite multiple ceasefire agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel forces said on Tuesday they had reclaimed their stronghold of Pagak in the north east, less than a week after being pushed out by government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides have committed serious rights violations, including murder and rape, against civilians, according to UN investigators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">718 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by Austrian newspaper Der Standard on 10 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Report by &quot;red&quot;: &quot;'Closed' Balkans Route Open for Thousands of Refugees&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures from Germany and Austria reveal: the Balkans route, which is considered &quot;closed,&quot; is still the most frequented migration route. Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz admits that a total closure of the route is not possible &quot;of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vienna -- For many months, the so-called Balkans route has been considered closed for refugees. Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz (OeVP [Austrian People's Party]) has claimed the closure as a success of his policies. Topical asylum figures, however, suggest that there is no &quot;total closure&quot; of the Balkans route.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the border to Styria [province in southern Austria], for example, where most of the refugees entered Austria in 2015, police still register new arrivals every day. &quot;The people arrive alone, on foot, or in people smugglers' cars. Most of them are refugees from Afghanistan,&quot; says police spokesman Fritz Grundnig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In total, in the first six months of 2017, countrywide, about 16,000 illegal migrants were &quot;stopped,&quot; 12,000 of whom applied for asylum, the Interior Ministry stated when asked by [the Austrian daily] Der Standard. Compared to the first six months in the &quot;refugee year 2015,&quot; this amounts to one third of asylum applications at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up until today, a large number of refugees have entered via the Balkans route, officials report. A lot more people still take this itinerary to get to Austria rather than the Mediterranean route, which has been a key focus of Kurz' efforts since recently. Generally, people are stopped in all parts of the country. In the first six months, 4,000 refugees entered via the Brenner Pass [Alpine border crossing between Italy and Austria], which is currently a matter under discussion. Some of them were stopped directly when crossing the border or after they had been returned to Austria from Germany. In other words, one quarter of registered refugees have so far entered Austria via the Brenner this year, Interior Ministry officials report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No Zero Immigration&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as topical refugee figures are concerned, the province of Vienna reports the second-largest number of 3,000 new refugees in the first six months. Most of them have probably also arrived via the old Balkans route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister and OeVP Chief Sebastian Kurz would not comment on these figures in detail, but in an interview with Der Standard he admits that a &quot;total closure&quot; of the Balkans route is not possible &quot;of course,&quot; and that, &quot;of course,&quot; some refugees still take the old route to get to Austria. But the massive influx has been stopped, Kurz says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no doubt that, in March 2016, the national transport of refugees towards the north was stopped. But this does not mean that migration has stopped altogether. &quot;Immigration has not been zero in any country,&quot; says the spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Karl-Heinz Grundboeck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German business daily Handelsblatt recently quoted a report of the German Federal Interior Ministry as saying that just under 90,400 asylum seekers were registered in the first six months of 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of them had still arrived via an itinerary &quot;that should actually be closed -- the Balkans route,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the considerable gap between the figures of the Austrian authority, which reports 16,000 illegal migrants and 12,000 asylum applications, and the figures from Germany, Grundboeck says: &quot;We should be careful not to oversimplify the issue of routes. We know that there are two main routes, the Balkans route and the Mediterranean route. But apart from that, the people are looking for alternative paths to get to their target countries, sometimes bypassing Austria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austrian Interior Minister Sobotka Orders New Controls</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Interior Minister Sobotka has ordered large-scale checks concentrating on migrants in the border area &quot;to combat illegal migration.&quot; He is also planning to &quot;intensify the assistance operation of the Austrian Federal Army.&quot; In a statement, Sobotka justified the action by saying that police had &quot;stopped an increasing number of large groups of illegal migrants&quot; recently. The goal was &quot;to constantly reduce illegal migration,&quot; the Interior Minister said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Hay</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">733  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;With 65m people displaced worldwide, the refugee crisis can seem insurmountable. But despite this daunting scale, initiatives are being tried that could help some of those affected. Citigroup's charitable foundation is giving $2m to a project to train refugees for the job market and entrepreneurship, in Greece, Jordan and Nigeria.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with all its ventures of this kind, Citi is working with a partner, in this case the International Rescue Committee, founded by Albert Einstein in 1933 to help get refugees into the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Miliband, the former UK foreign secretary, is now CEO of International Rescue, and was at Citi's Canary Wharf office on Tuesday to launch the initiative with Jim Cowles, Citi's EMEA CEO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very important we reform the aid system so it's designed for the problems of today,&quot; said Miliband. That means not just providing tents and blankets. &quot;We've got to go from keeping people alive to helping them thrive,&quot; Miliband said. &quot;For adults this has got to mean employment.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty percent of the world's 20m refugees and 80% of the 45m internally displaced people live in urban areas. Four fifths of them live in developing countries &quot;&quot; the top 10 hosting countries combined have only 2.5% of global income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These communities are already stressed, often with high local unemployment, particularly for the young. But to improve refugees' welfare and reduce tensions with the local community, helping them become contributors to the local economy is vital, according to IRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Citi Foundation is funding the $2m project as part of its Pathways to Progress initiative, which it expanded in February with a commitment to spend $100m by 2020 to reach 500,000 young people with employability and entrepreneurship training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This two year project, Citi's first with refugees, is intended to help 1,000 young displaced people in Athens, Amman and Yola, northeast Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first part is going into local communities, working with community leaders, finding out who are the refugees and what are the economic opportunities in those cities,&quot; said Cowles. &quot;Then from there we work out what we do in terms of training. Citi employees will dedicate time to working alongside IRC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates will be selected based on their ability to benefit from the programme, so they will need a certain level of education and creativity, but the aim is that their personal circumstances should not be a disadvantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the training will be in generic employment skills &quot;&quot; though even that will differ between the three sites, in line with local conditions, such as the general level of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some will be in specific skills, such as catering. And at the end, graduates from the programme will have the chance to apply for investment in business start-ups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citi's experience in microfinance will have a part to play here. Efforts will be made to ensure women and girls benefit as much as men and boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cowles described the Citi Foundation's work as &quot;investing&quot; rather than making gifts, because of the care it takes to study the outcomes to see what worked best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This programme is specifically for refugees, but IRC is careful that across its programmes, it also supports local people in host countries and cities, to avoid stoking resentment. In Amman, it has clinics open to both refugees and Jordanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mediterranean refugee crisis is often said to have provoked a very negative reaction in Europe &quot;&quot; and is cited as the main threat to Angela Merkel's government in Germany and reason for the rise of the far right Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Miliband said despite this, IRC was doing better than ever at raising money. &quot;Yes, there are some people afraid of refugees,&quot; he said. &quot;But for everyone who says that, there is someone who says that it's an important part of my family heritage or national heritage and we shouldn't victimise people who have suffered in war twice over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He praised the &quot;acts of leadership&quot; by countries such as Germany, Canada and Uganda, which has taken in 1m refugees from South Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe is debating a plan to resettle refugees at the moment, mulling a number of about 50,000 a year. The UN estimates that about 1m refugees worldwide are the most vulnerable, and Miliband said Europe should be taking about 108,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are waging this argument in the US at the moment,&quot; he added, &quot;where there is a retreat from global diplomatic leadership and from the number of refugees being allowed in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miliband concluded: &quot;The biggest thing we've got to do is counter the fear that the refugee crisis is insoluble. We've got to show there are practical things you can do in your own country, to show that international aid can be effective, and that public-private partnerships can be effective.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank is ready to lend a helping hand to Bangladesh in dealing with Rohingyas who have recently entered the country in huge numbers putting pressure on its economy and social structure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has allocated 2bn dollars for those seeking refuge in different corners of the globe in the first-ever move of such kind, of which any nation can get a maximum share of 400m dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WB already communicated the fund's availability to the government that will now decide whether to ask for the financial assistance upon considering the conditions attached to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A finance ministry official said that if the disaster management ministry or home ministry comes up with a proposal, they will forward it to the WB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shah Kamal, secretary to the disaster management and relief ministry, told The Daily Star that they had already contacted the WB and asked it to clarify what mode of assistance it will be; if it is grant the government will take it, but if it is loan the ministry will have reservation about accepting this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a document the WB said, &quot;The purpose of the fund is to help refugee host communities to mitigate shocks, facilitate sustainable solutions, and strengthen preparedness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To get the financial assistance, IDA countries meaning those who get loans from the International Development Association, WB's concessionary arm, must host more than 25,000 refugees or more than 0.1 per cent of the population, have adequate refugee protection framework and action plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case programmes target only refugees, 100 per cent grant can be considered case by case. But if they involve peripheral issues as well, a small portion of the fund will be given in loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As per the purpose outlined by the WB, the fund for refugees would support projects in host countries that focus on the medium to longer term developmental needs of refugees and host communities, not humanitarian needs that are the mandate of other organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priority initiatives would include projects that promote refugees' welfare and inclusion in the host country's socio-economic structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund will also support legal solutions and policy reforms with regard to refugees, for example, freedom of their movement, formal labour force participation, identification documents and residency permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will help ensure refugees' and host communities' access to quality services and basic infrastructure, support the host population whose livelihood is negatively affected by the refugees' presence, and support policy dialogue and activities to ensure refugees return to their country of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund is also intended to strengthen the government finances that have been strained for expenditures related to hosting responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 34,000 officially registered Rohingya refugees are staying in Bangladesh. Besides, after the recent crackdown on the Rohingya community in Myanmar's Rakhine state by its army, as many as 3 lakh Rohingyas have entered Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of Rohingyas - registered and otherwise - living in the country has reached 7 lakh. The government has already allocated 2,000 acres of land in Cox's Bazar for Rohingya camps. It has also taken steps for the refugees' biometric registration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major and the father seek salvation for the refugees of Manus Island, Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Manusian men - Catholic priest Father Clement Taulam and retired army major Michael Kuweh - are defying the PNG and Australian governments in calling for assistance for the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus, and for a peaceable solution to the standoff inside the condemned Australian-run detention centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at his Papitalai parish church on Los Negros Island, across a small bay from the detention centre, Taulam said the enforced shutdown of the centre - in which 380 men remain - had left people vulnerable and suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over years of pastoral care, he has built up friendships with many of those in the centre, he told the Guardian and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now when they say they have no food, no water, no lights, they are deprived physically but they are saying too, that the physical is also spiritual for them. They are deprived of faith. They are suffering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus humanitarian crisis a 'damning indictment' of Australia's refugee policy: UNHCR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taulam said no government seemed willing to take care of the men who remain in the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia seems to be saying, 'Papua New Guinea, this is your responsibility'. And Papua New Guinea is saying to Australia, 'Do your work, clean up your mess.' And while this is going on, these people are suffering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kuweh spent decades in the PNG military, rising from an enlisted rank to become a senior officer. He trained and served alongside Australian troops for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Manusians were famously hospitable and had welcomed West Papuan refugees fleeing political violence in the 1960s. But he said Manusians were being stopped from providing food, water and medical assistance to the refugees and asylum seekers inside the detention centre. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five years is a gruelling experience for many, and it doesn't sit well for us, because ... we are people of hospitality and the current situation is [that] the authorities denied us to give them [help]: 'You can't do that.' Well, you can't stop a Manusian to deliver anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot leave my neighbour hungry. And leaving [people] without basic needs is out of the ordinary. Whose policy is that? Inhuman, totally inhuman.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kuweh said Manus's reputation had been damaged internationally by media coverage of the abuses, violence and privation over nearly five years of the detention centre's operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are being sunk,&quot; he said. &quot;Our name is being painted with all kinds of connotations. It is not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation inside the Manus Island detention centre, three weeks after it was formally shuttered, grows increasingly dire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water is running low and the makeshift wells dug by the men inside have been deliberately befouled by PNG immigration in an attempt to coerce the men into leaving. There is a meagre and dwindling supply of food and precious little medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fraught underground supply chain of essentials coming from Manusians outside anxious to help is ad hoc and vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Man on Manus faces deportation order despite 'real risk' of torture or death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kon Karapanagiotidis from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said he was inspired to meet the father and the major and &quot;to see men of such decency and integrity&quot; taking action to ensure the men on Manus were not forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The story of the retired major and father in of all the suffering and injustice we witnessed on Manus shows us the power of people's every day humanity and decency,&quot; he said. &quot;These men highlight an important story that has been missed by many.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Karapanagiotidis said, the responsibility for assisting should not fall to Manusian citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The villains are not the local people of PNG,&quot; he said. &quot;Many feel as much unease, disgust and distress as to what has been done to the refugees and people seeking asylum on Manus as we do. The fault lies with the Australian government.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crux of the standoff between the refugees and asylum seekers who remain in the detention centre and the authorities who want them gone is the safety of refugees moved to the Manus community, and their opportunities for a peaceable and productive future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraught relations between Manusians and the transplanted refugee and asylum seeker community have marred settlement attempts. Those inside the centre say they cannot be safe in Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manus Island is a small, close-knit and familial community. Almost everybody in the province is connected by the tight bonds of wantok, the tribal ties and obligations that reach across the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manusians proudly boast of their island's reputation as the friendliest of PNG's provinces. The Christian values of charity and hospitality to strangers run deep here and are proudly proclaimed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'The situation is critical': cholera fears on Manus as water and medicine run out | Ben Doherty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And many Manusians are empathetic towards the refugees' situation and have made significant efforts - often at great risk to themselves - to assist the men inside the centre and those seeking to make a life outside. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is a significant minority that resents the imposition of the new population, which is exclusively young men. Tensions, present since the centre's reopening in 2013, have been growing with the steady movement of refugees to the East Lorengau accommodation close to the township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been an increasing number of violent incidents between the local and refugee populations. Refugees have been attacked with machetes and iron bars, others report having been threatened, beaten and robbed numerous times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, too, tension over relations between refugees and Manusian women. Several babies have been born from these relationships, which have - in some circumstances - proven controversial in the conservative Christian community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One asylum seeker was accused of sexual offences against an underage girl. He was charged but denied the allegations. He died before the offences came to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compounding social issues, there is little physical space for refugees to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Ninety-seven per cent of land in PNG is held customarily by family groups and is in many cases their sole source of income and food. Refugees sent to live in Lorengau find themselves forced to squat on someone else's property and that owner is often resentful of their presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island: AMA calls on Australia to let doctors help refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other issues grate too: the refugees are seen, by some, as receiving favourable treatment. They are being housed, sometimes with air-conditioning, and given allowances for food and medical treatment, benefits not afforded to Manusians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one, not the Australian, PNG, or Manusian governments, is claiming that Manus Island represents a durable and safe solution for the men held on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taulam said the concerns over safety were real, though the hostility towards refugees did not represent the majority of Manusians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have spoken to a few refugees who have gone to Lorengau and we do have some young people on the street who snatch their phones and things like that,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that at times some of them have been beaten. And so they feel that way that Lorengau is not safe for them because those things can happen. It happens in Papua New Guinea, it can happen to anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes they say that Manus is hell. And we feel bad about that, because Manus is a good place and the people here are good.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1033 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first refugees to be resettled in the US from Australia's offshore detention islands could fly to America as soon as next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-five refugees from Sudan, Somalia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Burma - currently held in the Australian-run regime on Manus Island - were among the first told they had been accepted for permanent resettlement in the US. Most have been held on Manus for more than four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar number of refugees presently held on Nauru is expected to be formally accepted by the US by Saturday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the refugees have been accepted by the [US] Department of Homeland Security office just 10 minutes ago,&quot; Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Adam told the Guardian from Manus Island's detention centre on Wednesday. &quot;They have been told to pack their bags to be ready to leave on Sunday for Port Moresby. They will have two nights in Port Moresby before they fly to the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia's deal to resettle refugees in the US: what we know so far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is so excited, they are really celebrating and hugging each other. Some others are crying, they haven't been called for their result, while others don't believe they will ever leave this detention centre like their friends. It's really quite overwhelming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to accept Sudanese and Somali refugees appears to contradict the US's current &quot;travel ban&quot; on new visa applications from nationals of six Muslim-majority countries. Sudan and Somali are both proscribed under President Donald Trump's executive order 13780, a ban which does not end until 27 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam said it was bittersweet to watch fellow refugees accepted for resettlement after years of uncertainty over their futures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am happy for those who have received their answers and are leaving for the US. We know this cruel and inhuman system is going to end. This is what we've been fighting for the last four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm really happy for them. It's just going to keep my kind of motivation to keep fighting for the rest of the time I'm going to spend in this detention centre, fighting for the freedom for every man left behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam is still awaiting the outcome of his own application for resettlement in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others in offshore detention remain skeptical. Daily protests are continuing on Manus Island. Iranian refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani said refugees had no trust in the Australian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are playing with us and they are wasting time. After a year, they only take 25 refugees and are using this deal to waste time. We are very worried they will keep us here for five years or even more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are happy that finally some people will get freedom, but this deal is scary because they can waste more time with it. If they really are honest, why don't they mention how many people will go to America and when?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On both islands, refugees who have applied for resettlement in the US are at varying stages of the process. Several hundred have been interviewed and fingerprinted, others have been through the &quot;extreme vetting&quot; process run by the US Department of Homeland Security. Others still are undergoing final medical checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Dutton agreed to consider asylum resettlement in Australia, UN official says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But several hundred refugees, who expressed an interest in US resettlement as long ago as last year, are yet to have an initial interview with US authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2,000 people remain held on Australia's two offshore detention islands of Manus and Nauru; 1,783 of those have been assessed as refugees, that is they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their homeland and are legally owed protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,600 people held offshore have expressed an interest in US resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's offshore regime has attracted consistent and global condemnation over systemic rights abuses including murder, physical violence, sexual abuse of women and children, allegations of torture by guards, medical neglect leading to death and catastrophic rates of mental health damage, self-harm and suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said the resettlement arrangement demonstrated the strength of Australia's relationship with the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to thank the United States for their cooperation. We have a long history of working together on a range of global refugee and humanitarian issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister stressed Australia's hardline policies regarding asylum seekers arriving by boat were unchanged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My message to people thinking about coming to Australia illegally by boat is that this is a one-off arrangement that will not be available to any future illegal maritime arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any people smuggling boats that attempt to reach Australia will be intercepted and turned back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia offers to pay Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, said the government needed to continue to seek other third-country resettlement options for refugees not accepted by the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manus Island and Nauru were set up as regional transit processing facilities but have become places of indefinite detention,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said the resettlement announcement was good news for those who had been accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But uncertainty hangs over the future of the people on Manus. Even if the US deal is met in full, there are not enough places for all those who need protection. The government should immediately halt its moves to forcibly close the Manus detention centre until there is a safe solution for everyone on Manus Island. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The forced closure and forced transfers are pushing people into unsafe conditions in Port Moresby and East Lorengau, when there are no plans for ensuring they have a secure future.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Law Centre's Daniel Webb said Australia held a legal and moral responsibility for finding safe and durable solutions for all refugees currently held offshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In signing the US deal our government was rightly conceding that it couldn't just abandon people on Nauru and Manus forever. That was an important and long-overdue concession. Now, it is our government's responsibility to make sure not a single person is left behind. Not one life can be abandoned in limbo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally we were able to get a message to [International Health and Medical Services] who are working in East Lorengau camp but they said, 'We cannot help you there while you are refusing to leave the prison camp,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After two hours, a car belonging to the police mobile squad appeared and we stopped them and asked them to help. They said there is no ambulance here and you must wait until morning, then make your way to East Loreangau to receive medical treatment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally PNG immigration sent a car and picked up the sick refugee, after more than four-and-a-half hours since he collapsed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani said the refugee was taken to Lorengau hospital half an hour away however they did not have adequate equipment to deal with his condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man had a long history of heart pain and had seen two specialists in Port Moresby in February who had recommended treatment in Australia but that request had been denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Barri Phatarfod from Doctors for Refugees expressed concerns about the man's medical treatment at Lorengau hospital, saying no electrocardiogram heart monitoring or blood tests were carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is impossible to adequately assess a potential myocardial infarct in the absence of both of these investigations,&quot; she said. &quot;If this occurred in Australia it would be grossly negligent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six detainees have died on Manus Island - including one who was murdered - since it was reopened in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens say the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, must be held to account for the standoff on Manus Island. Dutton, however, accused the Greens of stoking tensions on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Australian government has stopped deaths at sea,&quot; he said on Sunday. &quot;If we allow people who sought to our country by boat to reside in Australia permanently, that will mean that the people smugglers are back in business.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, confirmed she had restated her country's offer to accept 150 refugees from among the almost 600 still holding out on Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said he would &quot;consider&quot; New Zealand's offer to take refugees from the Manus Island detention centre only once the government has completed its refugee transfer arrangement with the United States.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Bangladeshi privately-owned, English-language newspaper The Daily Star on 5 October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two senior United Nations' officials today stressed for urgent funding for Rohingya refugees, who escaped persecution in Myanmar and entered Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Mark Lowcock, UN emergency relief coordinator, and Anthony Lake, Executive Director for Unicef, termed the Rohingya crisis as &quot;the world's fastest developing refugee crisis&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN officials lauded the government and people of Bangladesh for its &quot;extraordinary spirit of generosity&quot; in offering temporary shelter to the refugees, said a press release of the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Funding is urgently needed so that all refugees have access to food, shelter, water, sanitation facilities, health care and protective services,&quot; they said in the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a significant increase in assistance, the refugees could face another catastrophe on top of the tragedies that caused them to flee their homes, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They reiterated a call on Myanmar administration to allow the full resumption of humanitarian action across all of Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is the full Joint statement by Emergency Relief Coordinator and United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Mark Lowcock and UNICEF Executive Director, Anthony Lake:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We leave Bangladesh moved by the stories of suffering that we heard from refugees fleeing the violence in Myanmar - and all the more determined that the United Nations do all it can to assist the Government of Bangladesh in coping with this crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human tragedy unfolding in southern Bangladesh is staggering in its scale, complexity and rapidity. In just the past few weeks, well over half a million Rohingya people have crossed the border, making this the world's fastest developing refugee emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People arrive fearful, exhausted and hungry, and in desperate need of immediate help including shelter, food, clean water and sanitation, and healthcare. They bring with them terrible accounts of what they have seen and suffered -- stories of children being killed, women brutalized, and villages burned to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government and people of Bangladesh have demonstrated an extraordinary spirit of generosity by opening the country's borders and leading the efforts to provide relief to the refugees. They have provided the world an inspiring example of humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were impressed in the camps and settlements we visited by the progress being made to assist the refugees. We saw the difference that the Government, the Bangladesh Armed Forces, UN agencies and our national and international NGO partners are making. But the needs are growing at a faster pace than our ability to meet them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are living in flimsy bamboo and plastic shacks in the sprawling and densely-crowded sites that have sprung up to accommodate them. In these conditions, there is an ever-growing risk for an outbreak of disease. There are also numerous challenges for the response including limited road access to the dispersed refugee populations, a population that is still moving and a lack of land for shelter and infrastructure. Beyond these impediments, we face an urgent need for the resources that will allow us to continue to ramp up and sustain our efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding is urgently needed so that all refugees have access to food, shelter, water, sanitation facilities, health care and protective services. Conditions in the temporary settlements are dire. Without a significant increase in assistance, the refugees, who have suffered so much already, could face another catastrophe on top of the tragedies that caused them to flee their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today an update to the UN response plan was released, seeking $430 million which is urgently needed to scale up the relief operation in support of the refugees and the host communities where they are seeking refuge. In support of this, an additional US$12 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has been allocated to assist in the establishment of new sites for the newly arrived refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We welcomed, in our meetings with Government officials, their assurances of ever closer cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, this appalling situation is not over. People are still crossing from Myanmar into Bangladesh, fleeing for their lives and requiring immediate support. We call again on the Myanmar authorities to allow the full resumption of humanitarian action across all of Rakhine state, and will continue to advocate for conditions to be created that allow for people to safely, securely and voluntarily go home.</SPAN></P>

His dispatches for the Guardian reveal the true horror of conditions at the Papua New Guinea camp</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2757 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2013, the journalist Behrouz Boochani, an ethnic Kurd, fled Iran after several of his colleagues were arrested. The decisions he took then have defined his life and in turn led to him becoming the essential witness to Australia's hardline refugee policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani travelled through south-east Asia and then by boat to Christmas Island, an Australian territory closer to Indonesia. From there he was deported to Manus Island, a remote part of Papua New Guinea (PNG), where he has been held ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Triggered by outcries over people smuggling, contentious arrivals and boat sinkings, Australia's policy - developed by both rightwing Coalition and Labor governments - is that while it will admit refugees, it will not take any that come by sea. &quot;It is not because they are bad people,&quot; the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told Donald Trump in a leaked phone call. &quot;It is because, in order to stop people smugglers, we had to deprive them of the product. So we said, if you try to come to Australia by boat, even if we think you are the best person in the world, even if you are a Nobel prize-winning genius, we will not let you in.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human cost is nearly 2,000 people detained on Manus and the tiny island nation of Nauru. Most have been formally recognised as refugees, but live either in processing centres or in the community, unable to leave the islands. The cruelty is largely tolerated, indeed embraced, by politicians in Canberra because it is seen as a deterrent. But detention is expensive -  A$10bn (&pound;5.6bn) since 2013 - and many experts believe the naval policing operation in the Pacific has had more of an impact. The UN, doctors, human rights groups and reporting by media including the Guardian have made detention a public relations problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia built a hell for refugees on Manus. The shame will outlive us all | Richard Flanagan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian journalists have largely been barred from Manus and Nauru, and since he began contributing to the Guardian in 2016, Boochani has offered the most visible, trusted testimony. This year he was honoured with an Amnesty International award. The film Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time was shot inside the Manus centre on a mobile phone by Boochani and shown at the London and Sydney film festivals. He is writing an autobiographical novel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Australian and PNG authorities stepped up their plan to disperse the refugees from Manus into smaller, less secure accommodation by 31 October, Guardian Australia asked Boochani to keep a diary alongside his opinion articles; extracts from both are published here. Boochani's English is good but his writing is translated from Farsi by Omid Tofighian from Sydney University. Boochani has limited access to email and electricity. Sometimes he is simply too hungry to file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His courage over the four years of his internment in the face of the horror of Manus - a hell of repression, cruelty and violence - has been of the highest order,&quot; the Booker-prize-winning Australian writer Richard Flanagan wrote last month. &quot;Behrouz Boochani kept on smuggling out his messages of despair in the hope we would listen. It's time we did.&quot; Will Woodward, deputy editor, Guardian Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        27 October                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agony of extreme hunger wakes me up early in the morning. Whenever I'm able to find something to eat I feel a sense of calm. I go to Oscar, Delta and Fox camps a number of times until I find some Kurdish refugees who lend me some tobacco. In a prison such as Manus, being able to count on the kindness of those who share the same language as you is always something to be treasured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a few days remain until the Australian government meets its self-imposed deadline and closes the prison that it created on Manus Island. On 31 October, the imprisoned refugees are supposed to be transferred from the regional processing centre (RPC) to Lorengau, a small town on the island. It is a place that reminds the refugees of violent attacks. They have memories of being confronted with knives, memories of theft, memories of threatening encounters. It is a place without safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government, in collaboration with the PNG government, has employed various strategies to force refugees out of the RPC. Over the past few months, large sections of the RPC camp have been demolished. They started with the telephone room - a bulldozer annihilated it. They destroyed a tent where refugees had been living. They cut the power and water, forced the refugees into Oscar and Delta camp and then bulldozed the place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The machinations of Australia's department of immigration have come down to these tactics. The services within the prison have been reduced to a bare minimum. The gym area has been disbanded and English language classes have been cancelled. Cigarettes, tea, sugar, coffee and fruit have not been available for a long time. The quality of the food served to refugees has been so poor that it is practically inedible, and what food is provided is never enough; many refugees end up going without.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have been receiving threatening messages from people in recent days: &quot;If you come to Lorengau we will be forced to attack you.&quot; On Fridays, Lorengau is a really dangerous place. Most of the attacks on refugees occur on this day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night the refugees held a large and decisive meeting, and everyone agreed that no one should leave the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have discussed the court case involving the Australian deputy prime minister, which led to him being disqualified from office [Barnaby Joyce was found to hold New Zealand citizenship by descent]. When something occurs in Australian politics, everyone thinks that it might somehow lead to our freedom, but I explain to a few people that we shouldn't forget the political climate in Australia and the fact that both major parties loathe us. We have encountered three prime ministers and three immigration ministers, and so far nothing has happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, a lot of European news reporters are getting in touch. I feel that this place has become a battlefield, and I've become a war reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        28 October                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, I awake from nightmares. The sun isn't up yet. It is the worst time to wake up because on the one hand, I am starving and I don't want to miss out on breakfast, and on the other hand, I am extremely sleepy. Just a short distance away from my bed an Iraqi refugee is highly distressed and suffering. For years he has had pain in his eyes. It is harrowing to witness this middle-aged man lamenting in pain; he has been utterly degraded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bed over on the other side is occupied by a Sudanese refugee. With enthusiasm, he calls me over - like he always does - to show me a picture of his daughters. A feeling of joy comes over him for a moment - he laughs, recites their names, recounts that the eldest daughter is eight years old and the youngest is six - then drifts into sorrow. Three years ago, his wife was killed. He has shown me their picture dozens of times by now; sharing his memories makes him smile and helps address the anguish. Then he asks me: &quot;When will we be free?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was pacing along the fences for the whole night, along with most of the other refugees. Today the refugees received pre-packaged food; now the long queues for food that existed throughout the history of the prison have disappeared. The PNG police force and navy are walking around outside the camp - it seems their numbers have increased. A lot of Australian guards have left Manus. We are expecting an attack at any moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing more agonising than witnessing the agony of others. I am weary from writing. I am weary from writing about people who have died. I am horrified at the thought of writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        31 October                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department of immigration posted a document on the fences in the prison warning us that we only have until 5pm to exit the camp. If we remain, we will be confronted with soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 5am, all the local and Australian guards abandoned the camp. For the whole day, there has not been a single person to protect the refugees. We are receiving news from outside that the soldiers and police have armed themselves. However, no one knows for sure if the police and navy want to attack the refugees, or if they want to set upon the locals who have stolen everything from around the rim of the camp. Many of the locals have entered the camp and are taking away whatever they can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        1 November                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night the refugees were in a state of absolute exhaustion, starvation and thirst. At 7am, the generators were suddenly shut off. The heat is unbearable. This is hell out here. Hunger makes everyone angry, the atmosphere is full of tension, and there is struggle and tumult. In these circumstances, a refugee has cut his wrist and his chest. Shouts come up and tension rises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rooms and tents are crammed with people. It is a tropical ecosystem out here, oppressively hot. Insects chew into the skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the power is cut off, the water in the toilets is also automatically cut off. This means the toilets have become even filthier. They stink to high heaven. It is so humiliating. I have witnessed with my own eyes how a human being can degrade another human being, using toilets as a technology of torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have become very weak over this past week. I have not slept. I am now undergoing a surreal experience where the horrifying reality of my waking state has taken on the characteristics of the most harrowing nightmare, and this nightmare is more horrendous than I can ever imagine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        2 November                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starvation, thirst and terror slowly but surely dominate the prison. Gradually these factors impose their power over the incarcerated refugees. Bodies are weak, muscles are fatigued, spirits are weary. It has been nearly five years full of anguish, anguish that has ground everyone down. During this last week, no one has slept properly. Everyone is weary out here, but the one mantra continues to reverberate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     We will never retreat and leave this hell of a prison. We will never move to another prison. We will never settle for anything less than freedom. Only freedom.                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the scene here in Manus prison. These words are the soul of Manus prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        13 November                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than 10 days, hundreds of refugees have been refusing to leave the prison camp and, as a result, the situation has morphed into a large-scale humanitarian crisis. If things deteriorate further, we will witness a disaster beyond imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We did not come to Australia to live in a prison. The peaceful protest by refugees is not because we want to remain in this prison. We are resisting because we want freedom in a safe environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        23 November                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I woke up as a thunderous sound echoed through my head. It was the sound of terrified refugees rushing through Corridor M inside Fox camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're attacking!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Run, they're attacking!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These warnings are well-known to the refugees. The cries of caution have rung out repeatedly for nearly five years. The entire prison space was full of refugees running away and dozens of police officers moving in like a swarm of bees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With rage, the police chief announced over a loudspeaker: &quot;Move! Move!&quot; He repeated over and over again that we had only one hour to move out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of prisoners went on to the roof, and hundreds gathered in the corner of Fox camp and linked arms. The immigration officers eventually sprang into action and destroyed the belongings kept inside the accommodation. They threw everything out of the rooms. They even tore apart the sweaty beds with their knives. A group of them smashed the empty water tanks. In the space of half an hour, the area between the corridors looked like a town hit by an earthquake or a flood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees simply looked on. A feeling of absurdity gripped everyone. It was an uncanny feeling that comes with experiencing explicit violence. The feeling that you have no one, that you have no solace, that you have no sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They eventually found me. Seven or eight officers grabbed me by the arms and carried me outside in plain view of all the refugees. Like a scene where a dangerous criminal is taken away. Along the way, one officer behaved just like a child and pulled my hair. Deep down inside I was laughing. They struck me over the back, they hit me on the back of the neck, it was not damaging, but they still beat me. Each and every one of them beat me. One of them crushed my sunglasses under his boot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was put in jail. In the distance I could hear moaning and yelling. They brought a camera and recorded me. They repeated their accusations: &quot;You're guilty, you've damaged our reputation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could see the gate to Mike camp. They forcibly transferred a group of refugees to the buses. In front of the gate, they laid one more kick into them. We were like a small country that had been invaded. That place was really a war zone. Once again, I remembered Iran, how my mother was always frightened that the government officers would kill me.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than 20 days of resilience, having no food, water and medication, refugees in Manus prison were forced to a new camp. Metal poles in hand, the officers entered the camp and called out the names of some of the refugees, supposedly &quot;the leaders&quot;, telling them to identify themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again there was our silence and their violence; they attacked the men who were gathered in Delta compound, beating the men with hands, feet, wooden sticks and whatever was available to them, and in minutes forced the men to get into the buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men still traumatised by this violence were transferred to the East Lorengau camp. This camp has a capacity of 280 people, but by the end of the day they had relocated almost 400 men there. About 60 people remained homeless for two days. Eventually, police relocated 25 of these 60 men to a classroom, which the men have had to fit out themselves as best they can in order to sleep there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw a large number of relocated men with bruises and wounds on their bodies, clearly caused by their recent beatings with metal poles. I visited a man, semi-naked and with bare feet, sitting in the dirt. His face was bloody. I spoke with him, but he was completely silent. Others told me that police had beaten him, he had lost his belongings, and they killed his dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian and PNG governments eventually succeeded in shutting the camp by force. Really, they have only succeeded in transferring this problem 24km away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last few days, I have been involved in dozens of interviews. These days are historically poignant moments. Years of persevering have finally lifted us up on to the platform of the international media. This is a great achievement for us; it is an enormous accomplishment for this group of forgotten men.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Two years after opening Germany's doors to refugees, Angela Merkel stands tall. How has she done it?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Sophia Besch, research fellow at the Centre for European Reform</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1114 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 2015, Germany stopped applying the rule that asylum-seekers must make their claim in the first EU country they arrive in. So began what has been dubbed Angela Merkel's &quot;open-door policy&quot;&nbsp;- she called it a &quot;humanitarian imperative&quot;&nbsp; - leading to Germany accepting over one million asylum seekers and economic migrants in 2015 alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics at home and abroad soon chastised her for what they saw as a rash and emotional decision, and predicted that it would lead to the Chancellor's downfall, especially after the mass sexual harassment of women in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015 . But after an initial sharp drop in Merkel's approval ratings, she has recovered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One month before the next German election, Merkel's Christian Democrats have a huge 15 point lead over the centre-left SPD. If Germans got to choose their chancellor in a direct vote, she would defeat her SPD challenger Martin Schulz by 29 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it seems voters have not just forgiven Merkel for the refugee crisis, they have forgotten about it as well: immigration is ranked at the bottom of the list of topics influencing this year's election, with only 29 per cent of voters citing it as an important issue. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                             Merkel: I wish could go back in time on migration                          01:43</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened? How has Angela Merkel survived, and what can the rest of Europe learn?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two reasons for Merkel's recovery. First, her handling of the refugee crisis was part of her successful strategy to win over Germany's centre-ground. Second, while publicly standing by her open stance, behind the scenes Merkel has worked to reduce the numbers of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel's leadership in the refugee crisis was less impulsive than it appeared. She tends to develop her policies cautiously over time - waiting for a public consensus to form, weighing her political options, and working towards a solution that keeps her in power. As the refugee crisis unfolded, she initially remained on the side-lines of the debate and only chose to 'be bold' when public support for an open stance materialised throughout Germany. If she had insisted on closed borders, she would have vacated the centre ground to the SPD and the Greens. Her response convinced many left-leaning, young voters that the country is in good hands: 57 per cent of 18-21 year olds want Merkel to be chancellor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Schulz faces down Angela Merkel in 2013Credit:      Yves Logghe&nbsp;/AP     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel also knows that Germany has the economic strength to cope with the additional costs of integrating refugees. And her calculation is that over the medium term, if Germany manages to integrate refugees into the labour market, they will help to rejuvenate the country's ageing workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest political risk of her 2015 move was that it alienated some right-wing voters, and contributed to the emergence of the right-wing Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland (AfD). The party won supporters by transforming itself from&nbsp;an anti-euro party into an increasingly nationalist and anti-refugee party. Merkel is lucky that AfD infighting and the stigma of the far-right in Germany has limited the party's influence. Even though it will probably enter the Bundestag in September, unlike Britain's Ukip, it has not succeeded in shaping domestic political debate in a significant way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                             Merkel booed at refugee centre in Germany                         01:00</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel has also found a way to appease the critics in her own party, especially in the Christian Democrats' sister party, Bavaria's CSU. At the beginning of her election campaign, in a powerful gesture of reconciliation, she distanced herself from her initial &quot;we can do it&quot; mantra, and acknowledged fears around &quot;unregistered and uncontrolled&quot; immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While proclaiming Willkommenspolitik in public, Merkel has quietly worked hard to bring down the number of people arriving in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berlin started passing and implementing tougher rules on refugees, including faster deportation procedures, in October 2015, and has since continued to tighten immigration laws. Merkel also struck a deal with Turkey's Erdogan, which provided aid, held out the prospect of visa liberalisation for Turks visiting the EU, and allowed a set number of refugees currently living in or passing through Turkey to be resettled in the EU. In exchange, Ankara promised to block refugees outside of that quota from coming to Europe, and to take back people from Greece. And, perhaps most importantly, Merkel has benefitted from Balkan countries - and Hungary and Austria - closing the land route to Germany from Greece. In the first six months of 2017, only 90,000 asylum-seekers arrived in Germany, as many as sometimes arrived in one month in late 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These steps allowed Merkel to limit immigration while continuing to say welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Merkel and Turkey's President Erdogan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Merkel's political survival of the refugee crisis is fascinating, it is not the whole story. Merkel may well have convinced German voters that they do no longer need to worry about refugees, but in reality, Europe continues to struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the refugee crisis, Germany took the lead but the rest of Europe did not follow. Germans felt abandoned by other member states, who felt that Germany pushed ahead without consulting them. Germany's deviation from its traditional, consensus-building approach in Europe was painful and politically costly, and once more showed the limits of German leadership in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overseas arrivals | Turkey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also warped Europe's foreign policy. Take Turkey, for example. Merkel's offer of financial and political incentives to Ankara to help reduce the flow of Syrian refugees has bought her some time, but has encouraged the EU to turn a blind eye to Turkey's appalling human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel's management of the refugee issue is also an example of the EU's tendency to address the effects of a crisis, rather than deal with the causes. &nbsp;The refugee crisis is far from over. Around 90,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year, and 2,000 have died while trying to cross the Mediterranean. And as of May 2017, almost 50,000 remain stranded in refugee camps in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU must reform its asylum system and it must reduce the flow of people before they reach the union's external borders - that means more action in Syria, Libya and Sub-Saharan Africa - be it through development aid, peace-building or military measures. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years on, Europe still has a lot of work to do to tackle the refugee crisis. If Merkel wins in September, she must herd Europeans towards a common migration strategy. We should wish her luck.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Co Down hockey club is helping bring refugees from the civil war raging in South Sudan together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangor Hockey Club has donated more than 120 sports kits to a refugee camp in northern Uganda, which is home to 60,000 people who have fled conflict across the border in war-torn South Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has said the number of refugees from the conflict has reached one million, in a grim milestone for what has become the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sports kits are being used by young people taking part in the 'Peace and Reconciliation Cup', a tournament at the camp which is using soccer to help heal division and tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation was made possible by local charity CMS Ireland (Christian Mission Society), an organisation working with churches in Africa and Asia.<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#12288;</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through their local partners in Uganda, the kit was distributed to local church leaders in the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of education, food shortages, inadequate medical services and scarcity of building supplies are all huge challenges. A major concern is the lack of constructive activities, making young people easy prey for rebel recruitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Gowdy from Bangor Hockey Club said: &quot;The club had many kits that were no longer going to be used. We really wanted to donate them to a charity that would be able to give them to people who are most in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Through CMS Ireland, we were able to send them to Uganda and to help refugees from South Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was fantastic to see pictures of the people in the camp playing sport in the kit and as a club we are delighted to have made a small, positive difference to the lives of the people there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An average of 1,800 South Sudanese citizens have been arriving daily in Uganda over the past 12 months, the UNHCR said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,&quot; the UNHCR said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With refugees still arriving in their thousands, the amount of aid we are able to deliver is increasingly falling short.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another one million or more South Sudanese are sheltering in Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Congo and Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people fleeing jumped after deadly fighting again erupted in South Sudan's capital Juba in July 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fundraising summit hosted by Uganda in June raised only a fraction of the &pound;1.5 billion that Ugandan officials have said is needed to sufficiently look after the refugees and the communities hosting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This unhappy 1-million milestone must serve as a wake-up call to the international community that much more is needed from them,&quot; Sarah Jackson, an Amnesty International official in the region, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With no resolution to the conflict in South Sudan in sight, refugees will continue to flee to Uganda and the humanitarian crisis will only escalate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the refugees are women and children fleeing violence, often along ethnic lines, since the world's newest country erupted into violence in December 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan refugee officials have repeatedly warned the influx is straining the country's ability to be generous to the refugees, who are often given small plots of land for building temporary shelters and planting crops when they arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest of the settlements hosting refugees from South Sudan, Bidi Bidi, is roughly 90 square miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme cut food rations for some refugees amid funding shortages in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN says at least &pound;523 million is needed to support South Sudanese refugees in Uganda this year, although only a fifth of that amount has been received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money is needed to provide basic services, including stocking clinics with medicines and putting up schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies say classroom sizes in the few available schools often exceed 200 pupils, and other children have dropped out because the nearest schools are located miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting persists in parts of South Sudan despite multiple ceasefire agreements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis has called on world leaders to do more to help refugees and migrants, in an attempt toput pressure on politicians to improve what he called the &quot;lamentable&quot; situation facing people fleeing conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His intervention cameas theVatican published a detailed policy document outlining how states should approach the refugee crisis. It calls for migrants and refugees to be given more support at every stage of their journey, including in the countries they eventually arrive in, and proposes creating humanitarian corridors for people trying to escape war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States must also do more to help refugees into work and education, Pope Francis said, as he calledon wealthier nations to support developing countries that are bearing the brunt of the refugee crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN estimates that 56 per cent of the world's displaced people are in Africa and the Middle East - often in countries that lack the infrastructure and resources to cope with a growing population. Only 17 per cent of migrants and refugees are currently in Europe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis says he will stand up to Donald Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was published by the Vatican's migrants and refugees department, which reports directly to the Pope. Officials say the issue is at the heart of his agenda, along with tackling climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He previously condemned what he called the &quot;globalisation of indifference&quot; after visiting a migrant camp in Italy and later said the way in which states deal with the refugee crisis would be &quot;a test of our humanity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In amessagereleased to coincide with the publication of the Vatican report, Pope Francis said &quot;motherly love&quot; must be shown to &quot;every person forced to leave their homeland in search of a better future&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This solidarity must be concretely expressed at every stage of the migratory experience - from departure through journey to arrival and return,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a great responsibility, which the Church intends to share with all believers and men and women of good will, who are called to respond to the many challenges of contemporary migration with generosity, promptness, wisdom and foresight, each according to their own abilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries' approach to migrants should be summarised as &quot;to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate,&quot;he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pope's intervention comes a year before world leaders will meet at the United Nationsin New York to try to agree new measures to help refugees and migrants. There remain major disagreements between states on what should be done, with many Mediterranean countries calling for tougher action to stem the flow of migrants reaching their shores while other European countries demand a more welcoming approach to refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laying out an action plan on migration that he urged states to support, Pope Francis called for migrants and refugees tobeallowed to enter destination countries &quot;safely and legally&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said states must take in more refugees and do more to reunify families who have been split up. Temporary visas shouldbe granted to people fleeing conflict in neighbouring countries, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticising the use of detention camps for immigrants waiting to have their applications processed, he emphasised &quot;the importance of offering migrants and refugees adequate and dignified initial accommodation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis also urged states to &quot;always prioritisepersonal safety over national security&quot; and ensure migrants are given access to basic services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">****</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. Ai Weiwei, 140 mins, featuring: Ai Weiwei</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei's magnificent documentary stands as a companion piece to the BBC's series, Exodus: Our Journey To Europe. Both projects are epic in scale, often heartbreaking to watch, and both put the current refugee crisis in a historical and political context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Exodus, the refugees told their stories from the inside, with cameras given them by the producers. In Human Flow, Ai Weiwei is the godlike figure, looking into the refugees' worlds from the outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One astonishing shot sums up the Chinese artist's approach in a nutshell. We see from very high up what appears to be some abstract shapes far, far below us. The camera descends and we think it is showing us an ant colony as we see tiny mites moving in the distance. The camera continues to head downward and eventually, at ground level, plunges us into the middle of a seething, bustling refugee camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no voice-over here. Instead, intertitles will appear on screen quoting poetry and philosophical reflections on the plight of refugees; headlines from newspaper articles will be shown discreetly. There are also several interviews with politicians and NGO representatives as well as many interviews with refugees themselves, often with their backs to camera. T</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constant use of drone-operated cameras enables Ai Weiwei to show scenes of thousands of people at once, walking or on boats or packed into camps. At the same time, the film is very intimate. The Chinese artist is pictured again and again interacting with the refugees, cutting people's hair, cooking or mingling in crowds everywhere from the &quot;Jungle&quot; near Calais to Lebanon, Macedonia, the isle of Lesbos and the indoor camp in the hangars at Berlin's Tempelhof Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 20 crews worked on Human Flow, which was shot in 23 countries. The documentary could easily have seemed disjointed in the extreme, but it is edited gracefully and is easy, if frequently shocking, to watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei is never overtly polemical. He is interested in the human stories, not in unpicking the root causes of the feuds and injustices that have led to so many millions being displaced from their homes. The majority of the refugees he shows are Muslims. He doesn't ask why this is the case. Nor does he try to make glib connections between refugees in different parts of the world. The implicit point is that they all suffer in the same way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, there is a deliberate ambiguity. One of the most striking sequences is of a tiger imprisoned in Gaza. We hear that this beautiful animal strayed into the Palestinian camp through one of the tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt. The image of the tiger confined in a tiny space so far from its natural home has an obvious metaphorical power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Ai Weiwei is letting us know that animals are treated better than human refugees. To get the tiger to safety in South Africa, different governments signed forms and overcame considerable bureaucratic hurdles. No-one pays this level of attention or care to the human refugees, who are ignored and marginalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film captures the surrealistic and cruelly absurdist quality of the refugees' everyday experiences. One mother talks about wandering with her child for 60 days in no particular direction, with no-one to tell her where to go. We see 13,000 refugees in a disused railway station in Macedonia as torrential rain pours down on them. They have no way of keeping dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei is fascinated by a tiny gateway into western Europe through which apparently more than a million people have passed. There are scenes of Afghans who've lived for generations in Pakistan, packing all their possessions onto very unsteady looking trucks and heading home, which in their case means taking a huge leap into the unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, the landscapes or maritime scenes are incongruously beautiful. Out of an idyllic looking moonlit sea will suddenly appear a dinghy overcrowded with desperate refugees in life jackets. Individual scenes, whether of a cow walking down the middle of a street as if it owns it or of a horse being trained in the middle of a garbage-strewn city square, have an unlikely lyricism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever he goes, Ai Weiwei always pays attention to the kids, showing them playing or getting up to mischief, seemingly oblivious to the squalor of their surroundings, or trying to make sense of the captivity in which they are forced to live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a logistical level alone, Human Flow is an astonishing piece of work. It is very different from TV reportage on the same subject. Ai Weiwei is offering a panoramic view of the world of the refugees. He treats these refugees with dignity and kindness, insisting on seeing every one of them as an individual with a story to tell, rather than as a part of some abstract mass of suffering humanity that those in more fortunate circumstances would far prefer to ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dinner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">**</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. Oren Moverman, 120 mins, starring: Richard Gere, Steve Coogan, Laura Linney, Rebecca Hall,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutch writer Herman Koch's controversial 2009 novel Het Diner (The Dinner) was a huge bestseller in the Netherlands and internationally. The book tells of two bourgeois couples (brothers Paul and Stan and their wives) who meet in an upmarket restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the meal progresses, after the usual small talk it becomes apparent that an act of extreme violence by their teenage sons threatens to tear their seemingly contented and privileged lives apart. The book has already inspired two other films versions in Dutch and Italian - and now it has been made as an English-language movie by Oren Moverman, with a big-name cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turns out to be a very sour affair. The charisma of the two leads, Richard Gere and Steve Coogan, can't hide the unpleasantness of the characters they are playing. Gere is Stan, a narcissistic and very shallow politician who is running for governor. He can barely stay at the table for a moment without being distracted by a call he has to take or some business matter, and is used to everybody doing his bidding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogan is an embittered and misanthropic academic, jealous and resentful of his brother. He brings anger and intensity to the role but hardly a touch of the humour you expect as soon as you see him on screen. The wives (Rebecca Hall and Laura Linney) are as miserable as their husbands. The teenage sons aren't any more pleasant, especially when they're setting fire to a hobo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moverman (screenwriter of such films as I'm Not There and Love And Mercy, and also director of the excellent Time Out Of Mind) probes away in forensic fashion at the tensions between the brothers. The film also asks how far the characters will go to protect their families, and what responsibilities they're prepared to take for their children's actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can see the points Moverman is trying to make, but it's just a pity that the dialogue isn't sharper and that the protagonists are so thoroughly unsympathetic. &quot;I just don't want to be with these people,&quot; Coogan's character complains early on. We know exactly how he feels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigsby Bear</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. Dave McCary, 97 mins, starring: Kyle Mooney, Mark Hamill, Jane Adams, Greg Kinnear, Matt Walsh, Michaela Watkins, Ryan Simpkins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigsby Bear continually confounds audience expectations. In spite of the title, this is no cuddly kids' movie - but it does feature a giant teddy along with large helpings of whimsical and sometimes juvenile humour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, it plays like a version of Werner Herzog's The Enigma Of Kaspar Hauser, re-imagined for a social media generation. It is ingratiating and creepy by turns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The holy innocent is James (played by comedian and co-writer, Kyle Mooney), a young man first encountered living in an underground bunker somewhere in the desert. He is not allowed to go outside because he has been told by his &quot;parents&quot; Ted and April that the air is toxic. (They wear gas masks if they leave the bunker.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James spends his days watching videos of a show called Brigsby Bear and then communicating with fellow Brigsby enthusiasts on a &quot;Brisgby fan forum&quot;. It's a bizarre show which plays like a clunky children's sci-fi drama, but also contains New Age elements and instructions in advanced level mathematics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We learn quickly that James is actually a kidnap victim, taken as a baby by Ted and April who aren't his real parents at all. When James is sprung from captivity and reunited with his real parents, he can't help but yearn to be back underground watching Brigsby videos. His real parents don't seem to &quot;get&quot; him at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ted is played in incongruously cheery and avuncular fashion by Mark Hamill. If he is a child snatcher and a bully, he's a very goodnatured one. The other characters in the film don't behave as expected either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James is a curious mix of resourcefulness and naivety. He learns to his utter dismay that Brigsby isn't real and that Ted and April made the videos themselves, and constructed the fans' forum. He also discovers that he can make movies himself, bring the bear back to life and create a story in which Brigsby finally defeats his arch-enemy, the Sunchaser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Brigsby never gives up &quot;even when everything is against him&quot;, James is heroically persistent in his efforts to bring Brigsby back to the screen. It helps that he has the assistance of the detective (Greg Kinnear) who &quot;rescued&quot; him and who turns out to be a stagestruck, would-be actor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tone here oscillates wildly. One moment, it's as if we are watching a family outdoors adventure. The next, James is being arrested as a terrorist for staging a spectacular explosion during filming for Brigsby. There is a satirical element to the film too as it depicts Brigsby becoming an online sensation and everyone assuming that the series is being made in ironic and tongue-in-cheek fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the odds, Brigsby never descends into cynicism. The film-within-the-film that James, his family and friends makes about the bear is unexpectedly charming, with Melies-like special effects and a beguiling innocence to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James, the seemingly autistic and emotionally stunted hero, has the ability to touch people and to understand them in a way that his frosty psychotherapist (Claire Danes) does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is something refreshing about the carefree way the filmmakers here ignore genre rules and develop their story in such eccentric and offbeat fashion. What is not clear, though, is at whom the movie is aimed. Kids will find it quirky and baffling while fans of broader comedies may be put off by its more bizarre elements. It's stuck in some no-man's land between the arthouse and the mainstream, between children's drama and adult-oriented comedy. That's bad news for the bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menashe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">****</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. Joshua Z Weinstein, 82 mins, starring: Menashe Lustig, Yoel Falkowitz</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menashe is a rough gem of a film, a small-scale but delicately observed and quietly funny Yiddish-language drama, about the tribulations of a Hasidic Jewish widower in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The endlessly beleaguered protagonist Menashe just can't get his schtick together. He has a young son to whom he is devoted but there is a very real danger he won't be allowed to keep the boy. Hasidic tradition demands the boy should have a mother and a stable family - and that's what Menashe can't provide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film is reportedly inspired by the real life of its Hasidic star, Menashe Lustig. He gives a wonderful performance as the well-intentioned but bumbling and chaotic father. Menashe has a job that he does very badly in a local food store. He is in debt to his boss. The elders and his own relatives are critical of everything from how he dresses to his unorthodox behaviour. He is given a deadline to find himself a new wife and to pay off his debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Joshua Z Weinstein extracts plenty of humour from Menashe's misfortunes. Everything the poor schmuck tries to do turns out wrong. He can't even deliver a consignment of fish without catastrophe striking. When he approaches the community's matchmaker and arranges a date with a recently widowed woman, the result is predictably disastrous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menashe is determined to prove himself a mensch by organising a memorial tribute to his late wife, but he can't cook and he lives in a tiny apartment. He can barely raise a chicken, let alone a child. At the same time, he is a devoted father to his son Rieven. In his own erratic way, he is sweet-natured and even quite resourceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film works both as a documentary-like inside view of life in New York's close-knit, tradition-bound Hasidic community and as a stirring tale of a father who will go to almost any lengths to keep his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever pickle he gets himself in, we can't help but root for Menashe. We witness his humiliations in the presence of his peers but see many examples of his kindness and his attempts to do the best by his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better Watch Out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dir. Chris Peckover, 89 mins, starring: Dacre Montgomery, Olivia DeJonge, Virginia Madsen, Patrick Warburton, Levi Miller, Ed Oxenbould</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its cynicism, violence and black humour, Better Watch Out is an antidote to the typical Christmas movie - but it is an exploitative, silly and thoroughly unpleasant affair, with a premise that defies credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film is billed as &quot;'Home Alone' meets 'Scream'&quot; and is also clearly an attempt to emulate the much slicker youth-oriented horror movies made by Jason Blum. Levi Miller plays the demonic12-year-old anti-hero Luke, who wants to get it on with his babysitter but ends up terrorising her instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film completely fails to explain how or why politely spoken, slightly nerdy little Luke has turned into an adolescent psychopath or why no one has noticed before quite what a scumbag he actually is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashley (Olivia DeJonge), the babysitter, is about to leave town for a new life in Pittsburgh. It's the festive season and she is looking after little Luke while his parents go out to a party. No sooner have they left the house than the shock tactics begin. There are spiders to scare her, bricks through the window, prowlers in the grounds, a masked invader, and trip wires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the grimmest moments, carols or Christmas music will blast away on the soundtrack. The film, though set in the US, is Australian-made - and one or two of the young actors have an Aussie twang in their voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on, the film appears to be tongue in cheek. We are told that when you are frightened, your body releases the same dopamine as when you are aroused - one reason why horror movies are sometimes so pleasurable to watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best scenes are those involving the parents - the sarcastic, acidic tongued mother (Virginia Madsen) and her browbeaten husband (Patrick Warburton) in his ridiculous Christmas tie. The parents, though, are only on screen for a few minutes. After that, we're left in the hands of the Tom Ripley-like Luke and his best friend, Garrett (Ed Oxenbould.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts at giving the film a comic dimension are undermined by the sheer viciousness with which Luke behaves. Smashing a snowman with a baseball bat is one thing, but it's quite another to show the same malicious glee when hitting one of Ashley's ex-boyfriends in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The filmmakers come up with some striking imagery for example, the blood of one victim mingling with yellow paint in a colourful gouache, or a gruesome but cleverly staged scene of a hanging. Overall, though, this is grim and repellent fare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO Welsh councils have accepted no refugees over the past year, new figures have revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a freedom of information request to all 22 Welsh local authorities, both Merthyr Tydfil and Neath Porth Talbot councils revealed they did not take in any refugees in the past 12 months for which they have data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other 20 council areas all took in refugees. In total at least 325 refugees have been taken in by councils in Wales over the last year, including 11 from Syria who were resettled in Cardiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Merthyr Tydfil council spokesman said: &quot;When the Syrian Resettlement Programme was first introduced the authority entered into a collaborative arrangement with a neighbouring authority that resulted in two families coming to Merthyr Tydfil in June and August of 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our neighbouring authority also received families and due to the workload, understandably, the resource was dedicated to that authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An officer from Merthyr Tydfil council was identified and provided guidance on the Syrian Resettlement Programme to support the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However the two families relocated themselves outside of Merthyr Tydfil county borough and therefore under the Syrian Resettlement Programme they were no longer afforded support from Home Office funding. The Merthyr Tydfil council officer retired. &quot;The current financial position is challenging and the allocation of resources has had to be balanced with the experience this authority has had of families relocating to other areas within a relatively short period of arriving. Our ongoing participation therefore remains under review.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bridgend resettled 31 refugees from Syria, Rhondda Cynon Taf accepted 15, all from Syria and Sudan and Vale of Glamorgan took in 28 from Syria, Lebanon and Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caerphilly specified it has not &quot;taken in&quot; or &quot;accepted&quot; refugees but has &quot;assisted the settlement&quot; of 10 individuals from two families during the past 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All were Syrian nationals resettled from the Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirsty Davies-Warner, head of Oxfam Cymru, said the charity was &quot;pleased&quot; with how Wales has responded to the refugee crisis to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Since 2015, when we first called on Wales to resettle Syrian refugees, each local authority has done so. &quot;The majority of which had no previous experience of resettlement and have since gone above and beyond, taking in more people than they originally pledged to resettle which just goes to show how much can be achieved when the will is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, we know that the need for resettlement is now greater than ever - last year 20 people were forced to flee their home every minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a key challenge of our time and as a globally responsible nation Wales needs to maintain the momentum by continuing to offer resettlement places to vulnerable refugees and ensure that accessible and appropriate support and services are available to both asylum seekers and refugees when they arrive.&quot; It comes after the British Red Cross warned refugees across Wales were being placed in &quot;desperate and degrading situations&quot; as the charity called on the UK and Welsh Governments to do more to help destitute refugees in Wales.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials interviewing refugees held in an Australian-run offshore detention center left the facility abruptly, three detainees said on Saturday, throwing further doubt over a plan to resettle many of the detainees in America.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials halted screening interviews and departed the Pacific island of Nauru on Friday, two weeks short of their scheduled timetable and a day after Washington said the United States had reached its annual refugee intake cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'U.S. (officials) were scheduled to be on Nauru until July 26 but they left on Friday,' one refugee told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he did not want to jeopardize his application for U.S. resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, a senior member of the union that represents refugee officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a Department of Homeland Security agency, told Reuters his own trip to Nauru was not going forward as scheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jason Marks, chief steward of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1924, told Reuters his trip has now been pushed back and it was unclear whether it will actually happen. The USCIS did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian Immigration Department declined to comment on the whereabouts of the U.S. officials or the future of a refugee swap agreement between Australia and the United States that President Donald Trump earlier this year branded a 'dumb deal'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An indefinite postponement of the deal would have significant repercussions for Australia's pledge to close a second detention center on Papua New Guinea's Manus island on Oct 31. Only 70 refugees, less than 10 percent of the total detainees held in the camp, have completed U.S. processing.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The U.S. deal looks more and more doubtful,' Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said. 'The U.S. deal was never the solution the Australian government pretended it to be.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former U.S. President Obama agreed a deal with Australia late last year to offer refuge to up to 1,250 asylum seekers, a deal the Trump administration said it would only honor to maintain a strong relationship with Australia and then only on condition that refugees satisfied strict checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In exchange, Australia has pledged to take Central American refugees from a center in Costa Rica, where the United States has taken in a larger number of people in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The swap is designed, in part, to help Australia close both Manus and Nauru, which are expensive to run and have been widely criticized by the United Nations and others over treatment of detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A State Department spokeswoman said on Friday that USCIS 'has not yet concluded adjudications of any refugees being considered for resettlement out of Australian facilities in Nauru and Manus islands,' and referred questions on timing to USCIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government confirmed on Thursday that its refugee intake cap of 50,000 people had been reached with the new intake year not due to begin until Oct. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exemptions could be made for those who have a 'credible claim to a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States', following a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court last month reviving elements of Trump's travel ban while it considers the legality of the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the risky boat journey the refugees in Manus and Nauru undertook to reach Australia, it is unlikely many of them have strong family ties to the United States, experts said. The majority of the detainees interviewed on both Manus and Nauru by U.S. officials in April are from Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing to camps at Manus and on the South Pacific island of Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's resistance to the refugee deal had strained relations with a key Asia Pacific ally, triggering a fractious phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's concession and a series of high-level visits by U.S. dignities has since help mend connections between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has already offered detainees up to $25,000 to voluntarily return to their home countries, an offer few have taken up.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by Finnish conservative newspaper Helsingin Sanomat website, on 30 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Report by Teija Sutinen: &quot;Government burying idea of raising Finland's refugee quota - coalition party ministers still supported the idea in summer&quot;]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is allocating more money to security authorities and for expediting asylum decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HS [Helsingin Sanomat] has learned that the government, which is meeting for budget talks, has abandoned the idea of raising Finland's refugee quota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That could have led to a dispute between the government parties, since the smallest group in government, the Blue Reform, is strongly opposed to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finland currently accepts 750 refugees per year. In an interview with HS in the summer, Interior Minister Paula Risikko (Coalition) suggested raising the quota by 300 persons to 1,050. She had the support of Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (Coalition).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the Blue Reform parliamentary group, Sampo Terho, minister of European affairs, culture, and sports, and Simon Elo, chairman of the parliamentary group, rejected the idea right away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raising the refugee quota was already discussed in the interim budget talks in the spring, but no decision was made at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, after the knife attacks in Turku, the situation is politically even more sensitive, even though the quota issue is about refugees and not about asylum seekers who have come to Finland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People accepted as quota refugees are already refugees in another country. Last year, basically all the refugees selected to Finland were from Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events in Turku are reflected in the government's current budget talks so that the Interior Ministry and the Justice Ministry will get more money for internal security than promised in the spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the budget talks in the spring, the government decided to allocate 34.5 million euros more money to the police and 3.5 million euros to the Security Intelligence Service. These allocations will be checked and raised slightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The additional funds to the Justice Ministry will be used on expediting the legal processes associated with asylum applications, which basically means additional resources to administrative courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost everybody whose asylum application has been rejected appeals, first to the Administrative Court and then possibly even to the Supreme Administrative Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They now have a backlog in processing applications: administrative courts have more than 8,300 asylum application appeals and KHO [Supreme Administrative Court] more than 1,000. In administrative courts, the processing of appeals takes more than six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament decides the number of quota refugees every year in connection with the budget. Ever since 2001, the number has been 750, but the quota was temporarily raised in 2014 and 2015 to 1,050 because of the crisis in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finland decides which nationalities the quote includes and from which regions the refugees are chosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basis is an estimate by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, about who need help the most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Migration Service is in charge of choosing the refugees, and municipalities and the Security Intelligence Service participate in the process. The refugees will be placed in municipalities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACT government has offered to resettle refugees from Australia's offshore detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motion passed the unicameral ACT legislative assembly, without division, declaring &quot;that the ACT government is willing and ready to settle refugees and asylum seekers from Manus Island and Nauru in Canberra as part of a national program of resettlement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motion, put by Greens MLA and minister for justice Shane Rattenbury, said the offshore processing centres were &quot;inhumane and degrading&quot; and had been unequivocally shown to be unsafe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Pregnant refugees refused abortions on Nauru must be brought to Australia, says AMA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugees in these processing centres have been subjected to violent attacks, sexual violence, inadequate medical care, and harassment of mothers, fathers and children as young as six.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motion was unanimously supported by Labor and Greens members in the chamber. Liberal members did not rise against it or call a vote, effectively abstaining. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACT is the only Australian state or territory to have declared itself a &quot;refugee welcome zone&quot;, one of 148 zones across Australia, including shires and councils from every state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declaration is likely to have little practical impact. Decisions on granting visas are the bailiwick of the commonwealth, not state or territory governments. Amnesty International Australia said it hoped the ACT's commitment would establish a precedent for other states and territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This sends a strong message to prime minister Turnbull and immigration minister Dutton that their deliberately abusive policies are not welcome and that they must come to an end,&quot; Amnesty refugee campaigner Ming Yu Hah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugees and people seeking asylum who Australia has trapped on Nauru and Manus Island are not safe and further tragedy is inevitable unless Australia acts responsibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2,000 refugees and asylum seekers are held on Australia's offshore immigration islands of Nauru and Manus, either in the &quot;regional processing centres&quot; or in communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three pregnant refugees held on Nauru who have requested terminations and have been recommended by doctors for transfer to Australia, remain on the island, after being refused transfers by the Nauru hospital overseas medical referral (OMR) committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 refugees and asylum seekers are on the OMR list but have been refused transfers or not considered, raising concerns among medical and departmental staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is particular medical disquiet over pregnancy terminations being referred to the OMR committee. Pregnancy terminations are illegal on devoutly Christian Nauru, and the hospital's doctors are essentially being asked to approve a procedure overseas that is illegal on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Psychiatrists treating the pregnant women have raised concerns the women may self-harm, commit suicide, or attempt a home abortion if they are denied access to the procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians  have both said refugees and asylum seekers needing advanced medical care should immediately be brought to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition immigration spokesman Shayne Neumann and Labor senator Lisa Singh, have both written to the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, over the delayed medical transfers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neumann wrote he was concerned by the imposition of an additional step - reference to the hospital OMR committee - for politically sensitive medical transfers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I ... seek your urgent assurance that asylum seekers and refugees residing in Australian-funded offshore processing centres, in particular women and children in Nauru, will have access to medical transfers when required.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Singh wrote the Australian government was aware refugees and asylum seekers held offshore were consistently exposed to harm, violence and abuse and questioned, too, the involvement of the OMR committee in approving terminations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is the rationale for this decision by the Australian immigration department, that seems only to serve as a political means of preventing these women from being brought to Australia for medical care? What outcome does your department expect from this looming tragedy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian has put a series of questions regarding medical transfers to the office of the immigration minister but has not received a response.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's immigration minister has accused refugees on Manus Island of lying about being threatened by locals, despite video of at least one incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum seekers and refugees have claimed they have been subjected to multiple threats from local Papua New Guineans since being removed from the Australian-run detention centre and placed in accommodation in Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separate videos provided by refugees to Guardian Australia show two apparently intoxicated men at the transit centre, one of whom made death threats.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one clip, which refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani said was shot on Saturday, a man staggers around the outside of a building at West Haus wielding a long metal implement. He gestures towards a person or people out of shot, shouting &quot;You are a dead man&quot; and &quot;I will kill you&quot; in Tok Pisin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island: 60 refugees to be moved to Port Moresby for US interviews</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continues to shout and wave the weapon around as another man drags him away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video, shot through the metal fence, shows the man throw a rock at the centre before leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Canberra on Monday Peter Dutton said the refugees' claims of being threatened were &quot;complete nonsense&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The propaganda must stop,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't put them on Manus Island but I have the job to get them off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are lying. There is no question of that. Some advocates are behind those lies,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people off Manus Island, I want them off as quickly as possible, but the job is made harder by the propaganda being spread by people online, including advocates here and some advocates on the island as well. Any other questions on other issues?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second video, purported to be shot last week, shows a man who appears to be intoxicated enter a building with several refugees inside. He claims to be the landowner and security let him pass. The man demands food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm the owner of this place,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A security guard then turns to the camera and tells the operator to &quot;Switch it off&quot; and &quot;Delete that now&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani said the man seemed drunk but did not threaten violence, and eventually police removed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final few hundred refugees and asylum seekers were forcibly removed to Lorengau after an almost month-long standoff in the detention centre. The men refused to leave because they said they feared for their safety in Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days afterwards some were moved into the two unfinished accommodation centres, someone broke in to shut down the generator, and a group of locals staged a blockade protest at the entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani told Guardian Australia the two incidents followed others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, on December 7, an angry local man came to Hillside, yelling at security and refugees: 'You must leave',&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'This is hell out here': how Behrouz Boochani's diaries expose Australia's refugee shame</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In another incident on December 6 at 5pm a man stopped a Bangladeshi refugee on the road to Hillside, held a knife to his body and searched him. The refugee said police appeared and helped him, and the man ran away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani said the new accommodation camps were close to a village and they had warned authorities that would create more conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one should blame the local people for this situation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government doesn't respect them and dropped 600 foreign men in their small community. It's a problem created by the Australian and PNG governments and they benefit from making the place unsafe for refugees, to put pressure on them to return to their home countries. It's not safe there, and it's not safe here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week refugees were told if they wanted to apply for US resettlement - as part of a deal struck between the Australian government and the Obama administration over a year ago - they would have to fly to Port Moresby. About 60 were given appointment slips and had travel arranged to meet officials on Wednesday. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">810 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eritrean refugee standing in the blazing sun, surrounded by riot police, shuddered as she felt her first real surge of fury. &quot;I fled war in Eritrea to get here,&quot; she said quietly in fluent Italian. &quot;Where do I go now? Why does God punish us Christians like this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 41-year-old mother and house cleaner, Hiwot, was one of 100 Eritreans and Ethiopians, most with refugee or protected status, blasted by a police water cannon as they camped in the Piazza Indipendenza.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had set up camp, surrounded by their suitcases, after their eviction from an empty office building on the piazza that had first been squatted in by migrants four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her story, and those of her fellow Eritreans, reveals how Italy gives refugee status or other protection to thousands of migrants fleeing brutality - 36,000 last year - then promptly abandons them, providing little of the housing assistance or job and language training that refugees receive in Germany or Scandinavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees who could be smoothly integrated into the Italian economy are instead marginalised, evicted and ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaching into a bag at her feet, Hiwot pulled out a torn sheet and an old towel. &quot;This is what the city of Rome gave me this week - just this,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tacit admission of its neglect of refugees, Rome has long turned a blind eye to squatting, mainly by hundreds of Eritreans, in three large unoccupied offices in the capital. They include an 11-storey building on Piazza Indipendenza, by the Termini station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Living there, refugees could advise each other and hold down jobs in the city without paying the impossibly high rents. Described as &quot;a state within a state&quot; by one refugee, the building was run by a committee of four residents, elected annually to handle maintenance, security and admissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The locals hardly knew that 800 refugees lived there until last Saturday, when the authorities, pushed by the owner of the building, sent in riot police. Bereket Akefe, 37, who works at the football stadium, said: &quot;I was asleep with my partner. Three huge policemen kicked down the door and shouted 'Out!'.&quot; Mr Akefe fled Eritrea in 2004 after the regime jailed him. &quot;When we asked the police where we could go, they joked, 'Check into a hotel'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eviction coincided with Italy's increasingly hard line on migrants. After the arrival of 600,000 since 2014, there have been outbreaks of hostility this summer. Yet this week's eviction in Rome targeted real refugees who have fled Eritrea's brutal government. It took place two days after the attack in Barcelona. &quot;When Eritreans in Rome get evicted, it often happens after terrorist attacks,&quot; said Giovanna Astori, an aid worker. &quot;It is supposed to show that Italy is strong. And people don't care that Eritreans are Christians, or refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the eviction, tension was high among the 450 refugees in another of Rome's squats, an empty government office on the outskirts. Mulugheta Nayu, a translator who was an accountant in Eritrea, said: &quot;We have formed a sub-committee to organise beds for the dozens who have fled here from Piazza Indipendenza, and to figure out what to do if we are next for eviction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignored by the state, the Rome squats have not been immune to infiltration by crooks. Police have arrested traffickers at Piazza Indipendenza and kickbacks are believed to have been paid by migrants to open businesses inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nayu claimed that the shop, two restaurants and barber shop inside the Via Collatina squat were run honestly and bans on drugs, drink and stolen goods were strictly enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the emptying of Piazza Indipendenza, more than 100 residents bedded down on strips of cardboard in the street in protest. A few migrants with children, allowed temporarily to stay in the building, threatened to throw gas canisters if forced to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting on his cardboard strip, Mr Akefe recounted how he had travelled to Britain. &quot;I was given a lawyer, a language course and a bed, then they discovered I was already registered in Italy and sent me back,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Wednesday the refugees were offered about 80 places in migrant centres around Rome, which were turned down over fears that families would be split up and children would lose their places in local schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Mussie Zerai, an Eritrean priest who helps the migrants, said: &quot;Why didn't the authorities plan for alternative accommodation?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At dawn on Thursday, when riot police turned the water cannon on the refugees, including one woman with a crutch, they pointed to the gas canisters as proof that tough action was needed. The refugees threw sticks and rocks as they were baton charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police chased the soaked refugees towards Termini station, where one officer was overheard shouting: &quot;If they throw anything, break their arms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nayu said: &quot;This a country where they offer you asylum and then do everything to make you leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireland has been criticised for failing to meet its commitments on taking in refugees in a new report from a coalition of 23 human rights organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish Refugee and Migrant Coalition, which includes Oxfam, ActionAid and Amnesty International, said that Ireland was also failing to uphold its legal obligations for not relocating any refugees from Italy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has acknowledged that only 1,600 of the 4,000 refugees it pledged to receive would be in the country by the end of the year. This is below the UN Refugee Agency's estimate this year that just over 2,000 could be accommodated if monthly targets were met on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Department of Justice said that commitments had been made to &quot;fill any gaps&quot; using new mechanisms, such as a recent pledge to accept 600 refugees in early 2018. He also said that 500 people were approved to come as soon as space in the reception centres permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireland has also committed to take up to 200 unaccompanied children from Calais, but the report states that, as of last month, less than 30 had arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the scale of the global humanitarian crisis, the coalition urges the government to increase its resettlement programme,&quot; the report said. &quot;A solution must be found to commence relocations from Italy. Ireland must uphold its legal obligations to carry out relocations and prioritise the most vulnerable, including unaccompanied and separated children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, Pathways to Protection and Inclusion, recommended that Ireland resettle 4,500 people by the end of 2020. It said this could be achieved on an incremental basis over two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for the issues with relocating people from Italy stems from a dispute between the Italian authorities and the Department of Justice over whether security checks may be conducted by a foreign police force. Ireland will not accept refugees without securing garda clearance for them to travel, and Italy will not allow security assessments on Italian soil by the garda&iacute;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said this was despite the fact that Europol, the EU law enforcement agency, carried out security interviews and the European Asylum Support Office, an EU agency, carried out in-depth interviews and assessed whether a refugee had committed a serious crime before arriving in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other countries, including Germany, France, Finland and the Netherlands have accepted refugees from Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jody Clarke, external relations associate at the UNHCR, said the responsibility of hosting refugees continued to fall on countries bordering conflict zones such as Lebanon, Turkey and Uganda. &quot;We should continue to find safe and legal ways for refugees to find safety, so that they are not compelled to employ the services of smugglers and put themselves at the risk of drowning, sexual or labour exploitation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clarke welcomed the recent government announcement to establish a community sponsorship programme, which gives community organisations the ability to sponsor refugees. &quot;This is a development that should put the power in our hands to support people forced to flee their homes because of war, conflict and persecution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlie Flanagan, the justice minister, said in response to a parliamentary question last week that he was satisfied Ireland had made every possible effort to meet its commitments. &quot;The commitment by Ireland to accept 4,000 persons remains. We are also examining other options to ensure Ireland delivers on its commitment and expect to make an announcement in the very near future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in some compounds inside the Manus Island immigration detention centre have had the power, water, toilets, and phones cut off while they are still living in the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As 57 vigils - demanding 'Evacuate Now' - were held across Australia on Wednesday night to mark four years since the introduction of a regional resettlement policy for boat-borne asylum seekers, the situation at the Manus Island centre grows increasingly chaotic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compounds within the centre are being progressively shut down, even while people are still living in them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The withdrawal of basic services - including electricity, water and phone lines - is being used to force people out of the centre, which the PNG and Australian governments want closed by 31 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Dutton, the Australian immigration minister, confirmed on Wednesday evening that the centre would close by the end of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Offshore detention cost taxpayers $5bn in four years - and asylum seekers remain in limbo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manus Island is due to close by the end of October. I've been very clear about that and that is what we're going to achieve,&quot; Dutton told the Nine Network, adding the timing relies on the United States accepting asylum seekers after 30 September. However, the US deal has foundered after the US hit its 50,000 cap for refugee resettlement this year and officials abruptly leaving their on-island interviews on Nauru two weeks early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities want refugees to move to the Australian-built transit centre near the township of Lorengau, but the majority of refugees are refusing to go, saying they are not safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A notice posted inside the detention centre on Tuesday says that because refugees have moved themselves to Bravo and Charlie compounds within the centre and refused entreaties to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The power has now been turned off to Bravo and Charlie compounds. This means the phones located in Bravo has (sic) been affected. BRS will undertake electrical work to reinstate the phones after all residents have moved out of Bravo compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Power will remain off in Charlie compound&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff inside the centre say about 20 refugees are inside the compounds and refusing to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian has contacted PNG's immigration authority for comment, but has not received a response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday marked four years since the announcement by the Rudd government that no asylum seeker who arrived in Australia by boat would ever be settled in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Rudd, now President of the Asia Society Policy Institute, took to twitter to defend the offshore processing and the regional resettlement arrangement he struck with PNG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;July 2013 Agreement with PNG was for 1year only. Refugees should've been resettled in Oz by Abbott/Turnbull 3 yrs ago,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 2013 Agreement with PNG was for 1year only.Refugees should've been resettled in Oz by Abbott/Turnbull 3 yrs ago https://t.co/FYg0mm5TMi - Kevin Rudd (@MrKRudd) July 19, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudd also re-posted a 2016 article he wrote which said that refugees had been &quot;left to rot&quot; on Manus by the governments which followed his, and that they should be resettled immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coalition government, under both Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull have consistently blamed Labor for border &quot;chaos&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have seen elsewhere what happens when nations lose control of their borders...,&quot; Turnbull told The Australian last month. &quot;We cannot afford to let this happen again. We will not let it happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens immigration spokesman Senator Nick McKim said the declared tactic of pressuring refugees to leave compounds was evidence of the Australian government's &quot;willingness to engage in blatant human rights abuses in order to coerce refugees&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If power, water and communications with families were denied to Australian prisoners in an Australian prison there would rightly be calls for a royal commission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The men on Manus have had their rights and freedoms stolen from them by the Labor and Liberal parties, and are now being tortured to force them into danger. Enough is enough. They need to be evacuated to Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marking four years since Rudd's regional resettlement arrangement, Refugee Council of Australia chief executive Paul Power has told prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in a letter he had &quot;made his point&quot; on stopping boats, but that the offshore islands of Manus and Nauru needed to be immediately closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power wrote the refugees in Australia's offshore detention centres were Australia's legal and moral responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As more of the people sent to Nauru and PNG have been given refugee status, I have taken opportunities to discuss their situation quietly with officials of other governments and UN agencies. In every single conversation, it has been emphasised to me that the protection of these refugees is Australia's responsibility and Australia should not expect other nations to take on this responsibility, particularly given the current scale of global displacement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power told the prime minister his government had &quot;made its point&quot; on its capacity to physically stop boats reaching Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no need to prolong the suffering, uncertainty and fear of those who have now been held for between three and four years. Ultimately, the only practical and decent thing for the Australian government to do is to provide ongoing protection for those currently being held in the offshore processing arrangements in PNG and Nauru - and to do so urgently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island detention centre closing down with refugees still inside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus and Nauru processing centres were re-opened in 2012 under the Gillard government, but July 13 marks the date of the policy shift - under Rudd - prohibiting any asylum seeker who arrived by boat from ever resettling in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite consistent revelations of physical violence - including murder - sexual abuse of women and children, allegations of torture by guards, medical neglect leading to death and catastrophic rates of mental health damage, self-harm and suicide attempts, both of Australia's offshore processing centres remain operational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nauru will continue as an &quot;open centre&quot; indefinitely, but the Manus centre - ruled illegal by Papua New Guinea's supreme court 15 months ago - will close on 31 October under pressure from the PNG government and from the private contractors running the centre, who have refused to continue working there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly 2,000 people remain on Australia's offshore processing islands, and figures released under Senate estimates questioning show that the two camps have cost $4.895bn to build and run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department of immigration last month agreed to pay $70m in compensation to 1,905 men it illegally detained men on Manus in damaging and dangerous conditions, but did not admit liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania -- The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has contributed EUR 2 million to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in order to maintain food assistance for almost half a million refugees and asylum seekers residing in Tanzania and Rwanda. This funding is vital as WFP refugee operations in the region are facing critical funding shortages. WFP operations in Tanzania and Rwanda each received EUR 1 million from the contribution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing the urgent need for international support for refugees in Tanzania and Rwanda, German Ambassador to Tanzania Detlef W&auml;chter said, &quot;Being one of the largest international donors, it is our country's duty to help and support the effort of host countries and international agencies in this humanitarian crisis. We hope our financial support helps WFP to overcome the current critical funding shortage.&quot;<BR><BR>In Tanzania, the German contribution was used to purchase maize meal which is included as part of monthly food rations that consist of pulses, salt, vegetable oil and a fortified porridge. In Rwanda, the contribution was used mainly to purchase maize and beans for monthly food distributions. WFP Rwanda also purchased fortified porridge, sugar and micronutrient powders to support the most vulnerable people who are in need of a particular diet.<BR><BR>In both countries, WFP provides supplementary food for pregnant and nursing women, children under the age of five, hospital in-patients and people receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. These targeted feeding programmes provide much needed nutrition through additional foods such as fortified porridge or micronutrient powders. These food items are important in the fight against stunting and undernutrition in children, and they boost the immune systems of vulnerable people. WFP also provides hot meals to refugees who are in transit and reception centres.<BR><BR>&quot;WFP is grateful to Germany, which over the last five years has been one of our largest donors and has cemented its commitment to humanitarian efforts in Tanzania, the region and around the globe,&quot; said WFP Tanzania Country Representative Michael Dunford. &quot;The continued support from Germany has been crucial in meeting the food needs of men, women and children who have fled their homes.&quot;<BR><BR>Since an upsurge of unrest in Burundi in 2015, 258,000 refugees have crossed into Tanzania, making it the largest recipient of Burundian refugees in the East African region. Tanzania currently hosts 317,000 refugees in three camps, which is an unprecedented five-fold increase compared to the refugee population two years ago. Rwanda currently hosts 172,000 refugees in six camps. Of these, 87,000 are Burundian, with 55,000 residing in Mahama camp who are wholly dependent on assistance to meet their food needs.<BR><BR>&quot;WFP is now able to continue to provide food to children as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women in refugee camps, thanks to the German contribution,&quot; said Jean-Pierre de Margerie, WFP Rwanda Country Director and Representative. &quot;As refugees have limited access to income generating activities in Rwanda, food assistance remains critically important.&quot;<BR><BR>The increasing influx of people into both countries has resulted in greater resourcing needs for WFP to meet the basic food needs of refugees. Since February, due to funding shortfalls, WFP in Tanzania has had to reduce food rations to 72 percent of the minimum 2,100 kilocalorie requirement.<BR><BR>To restore full rations and meet the food needs of refugees in both countries, WFP needs an additional US$ 29 million for its operations in Tanzania and US$ 10 million in Rwanda between now and April 2018. If additional funding does not come forward, WFP may be forced to reduce rations further.<BR><BR>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of German Embassy in Dar es Salaam.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, Further to Clare Foges's article &quot;Time for a harder line on the migrant crisis&quot; (Aug 7), the UNHCR is very concerned about the thousands of refugees and migrants crossing the Mediterranean. To suggest, though, that the issue can be solved by ending the Refugee Convention that has saved millions of lives ignores the factors driving this flow. Some 84 per cent of the world's refugees are hosted by developing countries. I agree with the need to strengthen aid to them: this has been UNHCR policy for years. More support to such countries is essential. But people-smuggling by boat will not stop as long as the desperate have no alternative. This is why resettlement and other legal channels are key, as they give governments better scope to manage the situation and save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK has provided a leading example on resettlement in recent years, but states need to do more to address the shortfall in lifesaving resettlement places; of 1.19 million places needed in 2017, only 90,000 are expected to be available globally.Volker T&uuml;rk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant high commissioner UNHCR</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, Clare Foges laments that, by using smartphones, those &quot;in the developing world&quot; have &quot;the ability to learn their rights according to international law&quot;. She implies that access to, and knowledge about, one's rights should be a limited commodity. She also argues that the refugee definition is &quot;out-of-date&quot; and that the line between refugees and economic migrants &quot;is increasingly blurred&quot;. The reality is that the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees sets stringent tests of recognition of persons as refugees: they must be outside their state of nationality and have a &quot;well-founded fear of persecution&quot; for one (or more) of five convention reasons (race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That millions of people meet the refugee definition is a cogent reason to make access to protection in countries such as the UK easier, not harder; and to extend complementary or subsidiary protection where the 1951 convention definition is too restrictive.Dr Ruvi Ziegler</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associate professor in international refugee law, Oxford</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, Clare Foges seeks to address the pull factors that attract growing numbers of economic migrants from poorer countries to the relatively rich West. However, we also need to deal with the push factors that encourage people to make the long and perilous journey in the hope of winning the better life they can see on their mobile phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way would be to create places of hope within their own countries. The United Nations should invest in creating beacons of hope within those countries using the Hong Kong model: it should lease land from the government in key states with agreements to create a new enterprise city, to be run by the United Nations, with its own government, jurisdiction and laws. Freed from the barriers to economic growth these cities would be where people could find hope without leaving their homelands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have no doubt that leaders in many of these countries would be prepared to do these business deals for the right incentives.Paul Barnes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L'Horte, H&eacute;rault, FranceTHE POWER OF MUSIC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, To value Bach (among others) for his orderliness and adherence to &quot;strict&quot; harmony, as Melanie Phillips does (Aug 8), is like admiring Shakespeare for being good at grammar. Those who love Bach do so not because the music lowers blood pressure but for its exuberant inventiveness - its &quot;disorder&quot; - as well as its power to move us to the depths of our souls. And has our notion of education sunk so low that we can even consider downgrading Bach's works to a soothing background to make teenagers concentrate better?Peter Hill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor emeritus, Department of Music, University of Sheffield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, I admire Julian Lloyd Webber's campaign to promote music in schools (Thunderer, Aug 9), but the reasons he gives for special consideration being given to music apply to other subjects too. What makes music so special is that its three inherent skills (composing, listening and performing) rely primarily on the use of the ear. Music is unique on the curriculum in being the only subject that concentrates, virtually exclusively, on the development of pupils' aural skills.Paul Dyson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director of music, Easingwold School, 1976-2007HOME-REARED MEAT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, Alice Thomson's decision not to eat any meat from animals she has not reared herself (Comment, Aug 9) runs counter to my own experience. My family kept chickens after the war for the eggs and Christmas dinner. At least, that was the plan. Each hen had a name. I watched my father make a botch of killing Matilda, with a &quot;twist and pull&quot; at her neck that sent her head in one direction and her body with flapping wings in another. She was plucked and cooked; but when she was brought to the table, we just stared at her, couldn't bear the thought of eating her, and gave her a good burial at the bottom of the garden.Nigel Rowe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staines, Middx</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir As a vegetarian and former vegan I think Alice Thomson's argument is flawed inasmuch as a low or no-meat diet will cause one to be deficient in vitamin B12 with, over time, serious health consequences - something I discovered to my detriment when I developed blurred vision, tinnitus and bouts of total exhaustion.C Hardy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Folkestone, KentJUBILEE STATION PLAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, I would like to clarify our plans for Southwark Tube station (letters, July 31 &amp; Aug 2). The station was constructed as part of the Jubilee Line extension in the 1990s with the intention that the ticket hall would support an over-station development. To make the most of the site's potential we may need to build above the 11 storeys initially planned. This is part of our programme to generate &pound;830 million from property development to reinvest in the transport network alongside building thousands of new affordable homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No decision has been made on Southwark and we are carefully considering what changes to the ticket hall area would be appropriate. We are in discussions with adjacent landowners to understand what scale and form of development would provide the greatest benefit to the area. Any changes would protect the iconic elements of the station, retaining Alexander Beleschenko's blue glass screen, and would be acutely sensitive to the impact on the local area. We would also publicly consult before any final decision.Graeme Craig</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial development director, TfLSNAKE IN THE GRASS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, Your report &quot;Snake's alive: new species has been living in England&quot; is misleading (Aug 8). The authors of the paper presented genetic evidence which convinced them that the western European form of the grass snake is a different species to the eastern European form. According to them the British grass snake, included in the western form, becomes the barred grass snake, Natrix helvetica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the only native British grass snake. From the large numbers of grass snakes imported by the pet trade from southern Europe in the 20th century, which would now be named Natrix natrix, some escaped or were released in southern Britain and collected for museums as isolated translocated individuals. The authors make this clear in their paper. The research does not add another species to the British list.Malcolm Peaker, FRS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alloway, AyrCOMFORT BREAKS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, Further to your report (Aug 9) on the app that allows cinemagoers to predict when best to pop out to the loo, perhaps film companies should be reminded of Alfred Hitchcock's advice. As a director whose canon contains few films of over two hours' duration, he observed: &quot;The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder.&quot;Edward Turner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WorcesterRUSSIA AND CRIMEA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, I find it rather alarming that two of Germany's opposition parties, the FDP and the Left, suggest that Russia be allowed to keep the annexed Crimea to promote &quot;peace and security in Europe&quot; (&quot;Go easy on Russia, say Merkel's potential allies&quot;, Aug 9). This smacks of appeasement, with shades of Neville Chamberlain waving his piece of paper announcing &quot;peace in our time&quot;.Donald Douglas</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, We wish to add our voices to that of Sir James Munby (report, Aug 8), who issued a stark warning over the plight of a suicidal young woman suffering from a personality disorder requiring specialist in-patient psychiatric care. She is one of many adolescents and young adults with complex psychological problems for whom there is little service provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We urgently need adolescent secure beds to be equitably distributed across the country and a national strategy to address the transition to adulthood and adult provision. To provide effective therapeutic treatment requires a full understanding of all of the issues involved, which include eating disorders, autism and addiction, and access to a wide range of specialist treatments with multi-agency involvement. Staff require training and support to be able to manage the many challenges. We need data to determine the scale of the problem, and research is required to determine the most effective interventions. Such services are cost-effective: in Exeter a &pound;1.5 million investment has made an annual saving of &pound;6 million by reducing the numbers of patients being sent out of the area to receive treatment.Dr Sue Mizen, Consultant Medical Psychotherapist, Chairwoman of the Medical Psychotherapy Faculty, Royal College of Psychiatrists; Dr John Hook, Consultant Medical Psychotherapist, Private Practice; Dr Jessica Yakeley, Consultant Psychiatrist in Forensic Psychotherapy and Director Portman Clinic, Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust; Dr Miriam Barrett, Consultant Psychiatrist in Psychotherapy, Cassel Specialist Personality Disorder Service; Dr Catherine Bruce, Consultant Medical Psychotherapist, Wessex Deanery and Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust; Dr Oliver Dale, Clinical Lead Cassel Hospital &amp; Personality Disorder Pathway, West London Mental Health Trust; Professor Jeremy Holmes; Dr Jenny Stein, Consultant Medical Psychotherapist, Cornwall; Dr Samuel Stein, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Cornwall; Dr S Lisa Mukherjee, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Springfield University Hospital; Dr Daljit Jagdev, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Springfield University Hospital; Dr Diana Menzies, Consultant Psychiatrist in Psychotherapy, SW London &amp; St George's Mental Health NHS Trust; Dr Jale Cilasun, Consultant Medical Psychotherapist, Wandsworth Complex Needs Service; Dr Rex Haigh, Consultant Medical Psychotherapist, Berkshire; Dr Andrew Clark, Consultant Medical Psychotherapist, retired; Dr Christopher Scanlon, Consultant Adult and Forensic Psychotherapist, Visiting Professor Psychosocial Studies, University of East London; Dr Gillian Bluck, Consultant Psychiatrist in General Adult Psychiatry &amp; Psychotherapy, Joint Chair of the Cross Faculty Personality Disorder Working Group, Royal College of Psychiatrist;Dr Cleo Van Velsen, Consultant Psychiatrist in Forensic Psychotherapy; Dr Sally Mitchison, Consultant Psychiatrist in Psychotherapy, retiredFAKE EXHIBITS</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A United Nations-supported humanitarian conference today raised more than $ 344 million to fund critical relief programmes for Rohingya refugees and host communities in Bangladesh.<BR><BR>The exodus - which began in late August - continues unabated, making the crisis the fastest growing refugee emergency in the world today. As of Sunday, some 603,000 refugees are estimated to have arrived in Bangladesh and thousands more reportedly remain stranded in Myanmar without the means to cross the border.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Humanitarian donors have today expressed their solidarity and compassion with the families and communities in need,&quot; said Mark Lowcock, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and UN Emergency Relief Coordinator.<BR><BR>&quot;These very generous pledges must now quickly translate into life-saving relief for the vulnerable refugees and support to host communities who have been stretched to the limit,&quot; he added.<BR><BR>Since the crisis began, UN agencies have ramped up their relief efforts, including conducting a massive immunization campaign that inoculated more than 700,000 people against cholera, as well as providing food assistance to hundreds of thousands of refugees.<BR><BR>However, the scale of the crisis has overwhelmed the response, and emergency shelters, blankets, clean water, health care and other forms of aid are urgently needed. Adding to the complexity is that Bangladesh was already hosting about 200,000 Rohingya refugees prior to the crisis.<BR><BR>&quot;More than 800,000 stateless Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh aspire to a life that meets their immediate needs for food, medicine, water, and shelter. But beyond that, a life that has hope for the future where their identity is recognised, they are free from discrimination, and are able to return safely to their homes in Myanmar,&quot; said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.<BR><BR>&quot;As we come together in solidarity, I want to thank Bangladesh and its refugee-hosting communities and the donors for supporting them,&quot; he added.<BR><BR>There were a total of 35 pledges made today, including money pledged and committed since 25 August as well as new announcements. Several donors also announced in-kind assistance worth more than $ 50 million. Fundraising campaigns are also underway in several countries.  &lt;&gt;Screen shots of the ShareTheMeal app  One such initiative is the UN World Food Programme's app ShareTheMeal, which launched a worldwide campaign on Sunday to raise funds to feed Rohingya refugee children and provide them with vital nutrition with a simple tap on their phones.  The pledging conference was co-organized by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). It was co-hosted by the European Union and the Government of Kuwait. No durable humanitarian solutions to political crises - IOM chief  Also speaking today, IOM Director General William Lacy Swing underscored that while sustainable life-saving assistance for the refugee population in Bangladesh needs to be ensured, the root causes of the crisis need to be addressed.  &quot;We must urge international leaders to support the peaceful resolution of this decade-long crisis in Myanmar and insist that the authorities create conditions of safety, security and dignity in Rakhine state to one of the world's most persecuted populations,&quot; he said.  Adding that the recommendations of the Rakhine Advisory Commission offer a way forward to peaceful co-existence, Mr. Swing underscored that the implementation must start immediately and that the first step is to allow humanitarians to resume their work in the northern part of Rakhine state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand says it will only take refugees from the offshore detention centre on Manus Island with the cooperation of the Australian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from the office of the prime minister Jacinda Ardern, indicating a shift in her position, was issued on Friday after the Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said a move to resettle the refugees could hurt the countries' diplomatic relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Zealand's relationship with Australia is strong. The offer to take 150 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru remains on the table, but clearly it's up to Australia to take up that offer,&quot; Ardern's spokesperson said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Decay, despair, defiance: inside the Manus Island refugee camp | Ben Doherty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the prime minister has said, Australia holds all the critical information on the refugees in Manus Island so any take-up of refugees has to be organised with Australia's assistance. The Papua New Guinea government also said this week that it was focused on working with Australia and that it would not be dealing directly with New Zealand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments - a fresh blow to the refugees - come after Dutton, accepted that New Zealand and Papua New Guinea could do a bilateral deal to resettle people from the regional processing centre but warned that any such deal would have consequences for the countries' diplomatic relationship with Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand has reiterated its offer to take 150 refugees from Australia's offshore detention centres during a two week-long standoff as people refuse to leave the now-closed Manus Island centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Labor urged the Coalition government to consider the offer but Malcolm Turnbull has said it would not do so until the US resettlement deal is complete. On Friday, he told Melbourne radio 3AW &quot;it's a possibility that could happen in the future but it is not... a near-term prospect at all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked at a press conference in Adelaide about the possibility the refugees could settle in New Zealand, the Labor leader Bill Shorten said: &quot;If New Zealand wants to take the people from Manus Island, Australia shouldn't get in the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They should be allowed to go. It's a solution. I don't know why Australia wants to get in the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday Dutton was asked about a possible bilateral deal between New Zealand and Papua New Guinea and told Sky News: &quot;That's an issue between those two countries. Any sovereign state can enter into bilateral arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They would have to think about other equities within the respective relationships,&quot; he said. &quot;They would have to think about their relationship with Australia, or what impact that would have.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shorten said he did not think such a deal would strain relations between the countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite conceding Australia could not stop such a bilateral deal, Dutton argued it would be counter-productive because &quot;people smugglers are watching eagerly at the moment&quot; and any pathway to come to Australia via Papua New Guinea and New Zealand may &quot;reopen&quot; the movement of people seeking asylum in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going to allow that to happen,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If any boats arrive tomorrow, those people aren't going to Auckland, they're going to the processing centre on Nauru.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Turnbull avoids sit-down meeting with Jacinda Ardern on refugee offer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton labelled the New Zealand government's offer of $3m for services for refugees on Manus Island and Nauru a &quot;waste of money&quot; that could be spent elsewhere, such as on displaced people in Indonesia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ardern's spokesperson said in Friday's statement: &quot;If the offer is accepted, all refugees will undergo comprehensive screening and assessment processes that includes credibility and risk assessments and security checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugees who do not meet New Zealand's relevant immigration policies, security and biometric checks and risk and health assessment are declined.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN human rights committee has urged Australia to immediately close its offshore detention centres and bring the refugees and asylum seekers to Australia or another safe country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of detainees on Manus Island have remained in the now closed facility without food, water or medical supplies for almost a fortnight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court is allowing the Trump  administration to maintain its restrictive policy on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justices on Tuesday agreed to an administration request to block a lower court ruling that would have eased the refugee ban and allowed up to 24,000 refugees to enter the country before the end of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order was not the court's last word on the travel policy that President Donald Trump first rolled out in January.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the justices said: 'The application for stay of mandate presented to Justice Kennedy and by him referred to the Court is granted, and the issuance of the mandate of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in case No. 17-16426 is stayed with respect to refugees covered by a formal assurance, pending further order of this Court.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justices are scheduled to hear arguments on October 10 on the legality of the bans on travelers from six mostly Muslim countries and refugees anywhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear, though, what will be left for the court to decide. The 90-day travel ban lapses in late September and the 120-day refugee ban will expire a month later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration has yet to say whether it will seek to renew the bans, make them permanent or expand the travel ban to other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower courts have ruled that the bans violate the Constitution and federal immigration law. The high court has agreed to review those rulings. Its intervention so far has been to evaluate what parts of the policy can take effect in the meantime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justices said in June that the administration could not enforce the bans against people who have a 'bona fide' relationship with people or entities in the United States. The justices declined to define the required relationships more precisely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district judge's order that would have allowed refugees to enter the United States if a resettlement agency in the U.S. had agreed to take them in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration objected, saying the relationship between refugees and resettlement agencies shouldn't count. The high court's unsigned, one-sentence order agreed with the administration, at least for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeals court also upheld another part of the judge's ruling that applies to the ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grandparents and cousins of people already in the U.S. can't be excluded from the country under the travel ban, as the Trump administration had wanted. The administration did not ask the Supreme Court to block that part of the ruling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has urged the UK to &quot;step up&quot; and double the number of refugees it takes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior official at the UN's refugee agency said he hopes the UK will start accepting 10,000 refugees or more, effectively doubling its current rate, after 2020..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volker Turk, assistant commissioner at the UN High Commission for Refugees, said there was a need for countries around the world to address the crisis and help people fleeing the world's trouble spots.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has committed to take in 20,000 refugees by 2020 under a scheme set up to cover people fleeing the Syrian conflict, with 5,453 granted humanitarian protection under the programme in the year ending March 2017, and 3,000 vulnerable children and family members.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Turk, who was in London for talks with ministers, said he hoped the Government's response would be &quot;significantly&quot; expanded after 2020: &quot;It would be a doubling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk said he wanted to see &quot;significant numbers&quot; of refugees offered the chance of a new life in the UK after 2020, with a resettlement programme open to people around the world, not just Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his talks with ministers he said: &quot;We had good discussions about possible ideas about what can be done post-2020 and the Government is open to discussing this and to learn the lessons from what is ongoing at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope very much that there will be a regular resettlement programme by Britain past 2020 in significant numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;It would be a step change, it would not just be related to Syria. It would look at where the urgent situations are, to have a certain flexibility in responding to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we have to be very honest about the need for countries to contribute and to step up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk praised the response of communities which had already received refugees and said some rural areas had been &quot;revived&quot; by the new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was &quot;very encouraged by the reaction in Britain, by communities at grassroots level&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so amazed when I hear about rural areas in Britain that actually they are so happy that people come to them and it almost revives parts of Britain,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;whole of society&quot; approach was needed to address the challenges, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about attitudes, it's about engagement, it's about understanding towards the plight of people who end up - because of conflict, because of war, because of persecution - in a situation of distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Britain has a long history of asylum and sanctuary. That tradition is absolutely key and it will involve whole communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some ways, from the perspective of fairness, from the perspective of the rule of law, from the perspective of how societies have to deal with phenomena that exist, that's irresponsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I think it's an appeal to everyone who works in this area to come back to this voice of reason within, sometimes, very high emotions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">666 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GENEVA, Switzerland -- UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is extremely worried over continued violence in the Central African Republic, which has been causing massive new levels of displacement.<BR><BR>The number of Central African refugees in neighbouring countries now stands at 513,676. This is the highest number of CAR refugees seen since the start of the crisis in 2013. In addition to the refugees some 600,000 people have been forced to flee inside the country. This means that total displacement is also at its highest level ever, at over 1.1 million. Meanwhile funding, at 9 per cent, is among the lowest of any refugee situation anywhere.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since May 2017, fresh and fierce clashes between armed groups in CAR have wrought increasing suffering, deaths and destruction of property. Many newly displaced people speak of having witnessed killings, robberies, lootings and kidnappings. Even after reaching safe locations, they often risk assault by armed groups, if they venture outside. Unable to approach aid workers, they barely have access to vital supplies. With the crisis well into its fourth year, nearly one in every two Central Africans still needs humanitarian assistance or protection to survive. If the violence goes unchecked, this could fully reverse progress towards recovery in the country.<BR><BR>The Central African Republic had been experiencing a gradual transition towards peace and stability since late last year, when both refugees and internally displaced people started to go back home. Now, insecurity is plaguing areas in the centre, northwest, east and south-east of CAR -- some not previously affected by the conflict, like Bangassou or Zemio.<BR><BR>Insecurity is also preventing us and other humanitarians to assess the full extent of damage or displacement from the recent violence. Some of our planned humanitarian deliveries by air have also been delayed or blocked, due to the armed groups' presence. Moreover, aid agencies, including UNHCR, are increasingly among those targeted by armed groups and have, in some instances, been compelled to temporary withdraw their personnel.<BR><BR>Despite the challenges, we continue to help those displaced in areas like the Haute-Kotto provincial capital of Bria, which was at the centre of much of the displacement in the east.<BR><BR>However, the consequences could be disastrous, if there are no further resources to meet the mounting needs. UNHCR has appealed for US$ 209 million in 2017 to assist the internally displaced inside CAR and meet the needs of Central African refugees in the region. Nevertheless, a mere 9 per cent has so far been received.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the number of Central African refugees rose to 167,004 by the end of August. Almost 40 per cent arrived due to the recent fighting in CAR. Many have fled to remote areas, with scarce access to food, clean water or medical services. UNHCR has been able to provide relief items to close to 18,000 new arrivals, despite the fact that heavy rain, the lack of roads and the refugees' scattering over hundreds of kilometres make humanitarian access very difficult.<BR><BR>An additional 236,732 Central African refugees are hosted in Cameroon. Among them, over 7,000 people have fled there since July to escape violence in western CAR.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.K., Nov. 2 -- The UK Government made the following announcement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statement by Ambassador Matthew Rycroft, UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at the Security Council Briefing on Refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you Mr President, and at the outset, all the very best for your month as Presidency. I also want to thank High Commissioner Grandi for his compelling but concerning remarks this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We meet today at a crucial time for global displacement, with the number of people forcibly displaced at an all time high since the Second World War. And sadly, the trajectory is only upwards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, I want to share the story of just one of the 65 million people currently displaced around the world. It's the story of a mother from Rakhine State, faced with the hardest decision of her life: to flee into the unknown or face the violence engulfing the that province she calls home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were happy,&quot; she told a journalist last month. &quot;Now, we are in this chaos. They are killing and burning houses; people are unable to stay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with such brutality, she had no choice but to flee with her husband and children, risking the journey to Cox's Bazaar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we got in the boat,&quot; she said, &quot;we were scared as water was getting in. I was scared that it would sink; people were crying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her husband went missing as they fled, and she said, &quot;I don't know if he is dead or alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together with her children, she eventually reached safety - and I pay tribute to Bangladesh for the humanitarian assistance provided to her and to so many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that family's story has been repeated and repeated and repeated over the past months. Only two days ago, a boat carrying refugees to Bangladesh capsized, claiming the lives of at least four people. And it's a story that will only keep being told until the conflict pushing them away is fundamentally addressed and they are allowed to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Filippo rightly said, whether in Burma, in Syria, or anywhere else in the world, this Council has a unique role to play in maintaining the peace and security that would have stopped that family and so many others like them from having to flee their home. And we have a special responsibility also to hold to account those who do not respect international humanitarian law, refugee law and those who fuel displacement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simply put, the stark number of people in need today tells us that what we're doing is not working. Refugees are spending longer and longer displaced, often in poverty with a dwindling hope of return. A new global approach is now needed to tackle protracted crises and a more comprehensive response is required to help the growing number of people currently displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the UK strongly supports the aims of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework. It focuses on long-term, sustainable solutions. These help build the self-reliance of refugees and ease pressure on countries like Kenya, Uganda or Lebanon that have generously welcomed and hosted so many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Framework means delivering jobs, education, better services to refugees and host communities, while also better co-ordinating the international response. The UK actively supports this approach where the new Refugee Response Framework is being rolled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're also already delivering the sort of long-term response to refugees' needs that the Framework recommends - including through job compacts to provide tens of thousands of refugees with the opportunity to work in countries such as Jordan or Ethiopia, as well as innovative education programmes and support to host communities and refugees alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make these approaches work, UNHCR has a vital role to play in dialogue with governments, partnerships with other actors, and giving advice and support where needed. In Jordan, we welcome the cash assistance that they are giving to refugees to meet basic food needs. In Turkey, we support the assistance they are providing to refugees to prepare for the oncoming winter. And in the response to the crisis in Burma, they also have a role to play in the returns process in cooperation with the Bangladeshi authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to deliver all this and more, it is clear that UNHCR, like all the other parts of the UN, will have to reform, and I welcome High Commissioner Grandi's commitment to this. UNHCR has a central role, working with other agencies, in reforming the humanitarian system. It's important that UNHCR continues to work better and more collaboratively with partners on the ground, including with development actors. We want to see improved transparency, increased accountability to beneficiaries, more multi-year programming, and a continued scale up in the use of cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because, Mr President, in the face of an unprecedented need, it's clear that we cannot just do business as usual. We need a new approach, and we look forward to working with colleagues from the Security Council, from UNHCR, and elsewhere to achieve that new approach.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Sorry, please one cigarette, my friend.&quot; The man is young: early 20s at the most, Syrian I think. He and many others from across the Middle East and Africa patrol Exarchia Square in central Athens. Bereft of work, they beg for change. Often they turn to selling pirated DVDs, tissues or, occasionally, drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The great migration wave of 2015 saw around a million people make asylum requests in the 28 EU states. The UN high commissioner for refugees was clear on the severity of the situation: since the second world war, he said, there have never been so many refugees, asylum seekers and displaced people. And still they are coming. According to the European commission, the number of people seeking asylum from non-EU countries in the EU28 during the first quarter of 2017 reached 164,500.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  This Brexit leak shines a light on our collective lunacy about immigration | Jonathan Freedland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greece is a major point of entry into Europe for those from the Middle East. In desperation they come - often in makeshift boats - from Turkey, enriching people smugglers in the process. Refugees have left their imprint on Greece's national consciousness and on the fabric of its islands and cities. On Lesbos, I saw people sitting huddled in groups at the port. I glimpsed the barbed-wire camps that housed them. In Athens, they wander through the crowds, anonymous but ubiquitous. As the sun sets they bed down for the night: in shop doorways and on benches, in tents in public parks, and sometimes, if they are lucky, in filthy, empty buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greece is on the frontline of the refugee crisis, but its problems are replicated across Europe. Migrants rarely want to stay here. Instead, they make their way through the continent. True, German chancellor Angela Merkel has allowed a million refugees in, but her move has angered sections of society and galvanised the far right. We cannot escape refugees. But worse, they cannot escape us. The numbers entering Europe may have dropped since the peak of 2015, but a new question has arisen. They are here now, so what do we do with them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer may lie on the tiny Greek island of Tilos, close to Turkey. Tilos has a population of only about 500, but it is now hosting over 50 refugees, 100 over the course of this year so far - 20% of the population. And, thanks to a few simple initiatives, the refugees have not only been integrated but enabled. They are making a positive social and financial contribution to the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of these efforts is a Greek NGO called SolidarityNow, funded by the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations organisation. Fay Koutzoukou is the group's accommodation programme coordinator. Responsible for housing refugees across Greece, she is heavily involved with Tilos. &quot;Unlike Lesbos and other islands,&quot; she explains, &quot;we got locals on side from the beginning. In places like Lesbos the numbers [of refugees] were huge, but no attempt was made to integrate them - they were stuck in camps. This is not a good model.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For integration to adequately happen, NGOs and the private sector must take the lead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead SolidarityNow works with a three-stage, more inclusive, framework. The first stage is to get the local population to accept the refugees. The second is to organise Greek classes to provide the requisite language skills; and the third, and most crucial is to get refugees working. NGOs cannot support migrants indefinitely. More than this, it is only through employment that they can contribute to their host society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tilos, Koutzoukou continues, they found the perfect opportunity. &quot;During summer the island gets tourists so hotels and shops need extra people. We contacted local businesses and said 'Why hire someone from Athens when you have people here on the island for whom you won't need to pay travel or accommodation costs?' It made total commercial sense for them. It wasn't charity. It was a win-win situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond mere employment lies the final jigsaw piece: entrepreneurship. Tilos may only have a few hundred people, but it has thousands of goats. Thus far they are only milked for personal consumption. Plans are in place for refugees to partner with locals to set up a cheese factory and export local produce internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tilos can teach us several things: above all, that integration, even on a large scale relative to population, is possible; and that refugees can be a boon not a burden. The key is inclusion. More money needs to be given to similar programmes, not to funding large camps that do nothing but mire their occupants in a squalid limbo. For integration to adequately happen, NGOs and the private sector must take the lead: government alone - overly bureaucratic, risk-averse, fickle and unwieldy - is not up to the task.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As it stands the UK and European governments are catastrophically failing to deal with refugees, with many saying it's simply not possible. This tiny Greek island shows us that it is. We must learn from Tilos's example.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The worst is the carelessness in the decisions of big NGO's when it comes to moving families over and over again, all over Greece.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee crisis in Greece is a multifaceted problem with ever-changing needs. One of the biggest issues is the lack of continuity in the provision of services like education. The Habibi Centre&nbsp;(Habibi means 'my love' in Arabic) is a school established with that in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children at the Habibi Centre in Athens, GreeceCredit:      Egona Zancajo     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eighth floor of an apartment in a backstreet in central Athens, Martinez (alongside whoever she can get to volunteer) is teaching 25 children every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The classes are tiered by ability and there are usually three sets who attend, which means that Martinez teaches for around 6 hours a day; although she sometimes teaches for 8 hours without a break if she takes on an adult class in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Habibi Centre&nbsp;uses an online learning platform which allows the children, each with their own login, to learn science, maths and English via online worksheets set to them by teachers situated all around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee children learn science, maths and English from online worksheetsCredit:      Stephanie Martinez     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school was established in August 2016 by Martinez and Toby Leakey for refugee children in the Katsikas camp in northern Greece, and for a group of Yazidis from northern Iraq in another local camp. When all the residents of Katiskas and the Yazidis were moved into apartments last December, Martinez moved with them and set up the school in Athens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Habibi Centre, which operates out of three rooms (two of which are bedrooms for volunteers in the evening), has almost become a victim of its own success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We took in seven&nbsp;new students this week,&quot;&nbsp;says Martinez. &quot;Word spreads too fast. I have had to say no to some, although I'm not very good at doing that.&nbsp;I just cant manage any more people on my own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee status</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as teaching English, Martinez has been preparing the top set for English exams set by the British Council. These exams are not specific to refugees and many Greek children take them at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, as many of the children have not been in full-time education for years, part of the task has been helping them to understand exam etiquette; things such as not talking, or putting your hand up to ask questions during the exam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez hopes the qualifications will empower them upon arrival to their final country of asylum. &quot;Knowing that when they arrive in Germany, for example, they wont be given a chance to get a high school degree, we wanted to find a way to give them some form of accreditation,&quot;&nbsp;says Martinez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee children pose after sitting an English exam at the centreCredit:      Stephanie Martinez     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some children have already sat the exam, which took place in a high-end hotel in Athens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were so nervous...but they were so alive when they came out,&quot;&nbsp;she says.&nbsp;&quot;It was as if finally they had a say in their life, which is a contrast to their life as a refugee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst many other aid projects are short-term and gap-filling in nature, the Habibi Centre&nbsp;is a long-term endeavour with a big vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez has plans for the children to continue learning remotely when they get to their final destination, up until the moment that they start school in the country which they have claimed asylum in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In numbers | European refugee crisis 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst an apartment in Athens cannot fully replicate a school, it gives children from different refugee communities the chance to do something many children take for granted: attend school everyday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyday I am rewarded with seeing their eagerness to learn and self-determination to look beyond circumstances and work hard to take their future into their own hands,&quot;&nbsp;says Martinez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Endings have defined the lives of so many refugee children. Even when they get to Greece the nature of their transient lives between camps and cities create a series of goodbyes: to friendships made with volunteers and other children, of homes they build and schools they attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Route to Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strength of the school that Martinez runs is that, thanks to widespread Wi-Fi coverage and the relative inexpensiveness of laptops, its students don't necessarily need to say goodbye when they leave: they can bring the school with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee crisis is a 21st century problem, and so it makes sense that the solution lies in the capabilities of the age: there are now apps with phrasebooks for refugees, some that teach coding and some which connect refugees with spare rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Internet may be seen as a distraction in the classroom, but to the students at the Habibi Centre&nbsp;it provides a sense of continuity in the most uncertain of situations,&nbsp;and a bridge to a future where they will not be refugee children in education, but simply children at school.</SPAN></P>

The five countries globally that have the highest proportion of their population affected by displacements are all island States: Cuba, Fiji, Philippines, Tonga and Sri Lanka.<BR><BR>&quot;During this hurricane season alone for example, we saw the displacement of 1.7 million people in Cuba &not;- that's the equivalent of 15 per cent of its population,&quot; said Camila Minerva, Humanitarian Programme Manager with Oxfam in the Dominican Republic, during a press conference on 'human mobility and climate change' at the UN Climate Conference (COP23), in Bonn, Germany.<BR><BR>&quot;The poorest and the most marginalized are five times more likely to be displaced and to remain so for longer time than people in higher income countries and it is increasing with climate change,&quot; she added.<BR><BR>Mariam Traore, Migration, environment and climate change specialist with the UN Migration Agency (IOM) said that it is also important to remember that the slow onset effect of climate change makes people move and migrate, sometimes in a forced way.<BR><BR>&quot;In a country like Bangladesh, we did a survey last year and 40 per cent of the households we interviewed told us that climate change contributed directly to their decision to migrate,&quot; she added.<BR><BR>In this context, some have suggested to create a climate refugee status, protecting those forced to leave their country because of the impacts of climate change.<BR><BR>&quot;The refugee legal status is provided by the 1951 Refugee Convention, which is very clear on what [basis refugee status is conferred], which is basically persecution,&quot; said Marine Franck, Programme Officer (climate change), Division of International Protection, in the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).<BR><BR>&quot;In the context of climate change displacement, there might be cases where there is persecution involved where this refugee status could apply but in most cases, it doesn't,&quot; she added.<BR><BR>She recalled that in 2011, States had suggested that UNHCR create a new status of refugee for people displaced because of climate change. &quot;But some States were not ready at all for that,&quot; she stated.<BR><BR>Ms. Franck stressed that this issue of broadening the scope of refugee protection &quot;is not necessarily desirable, because there is a risk of undermining the refugees fleeing persecution and violent conflict.&quot; Moreover, she explained: &quot;We would need also to renegotiate the Convention and there is no appetite for that from States and it might not be the most effective protection tool.&quot;<BR><BR>UNHCR thinks it is better to look at what exists at the regional level and try to have a bottom-up approach with broadening at the regional level using practices that are effective. She mentioned humanitarian protection visas, temporary protection and stay arrangements, as well as migration laws that can provide real protection.<BR><BR>&quot;It is much more effective because States are going to look at what their neighbours are doing and may adopt the same kind of procedures, rather than if we adopt a global convention or a new category [...] it might not be easy to negotiate and it is not also sure that States will then implement it properly,&quot; Ms. Franck said.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners have lost a court battle to force the Government to take the number of child refugees it was expected would be brought to the UK under theDubs Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendment, passed in May 2016, required the Government to act &quot;as soon as possible&quot; to relocate and support unaccompanied refugee children in Europe. It was required to consult with local authorities to determine the number of children each council has the capacity to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Help Refugees, the charity leading the case, accused the Home Office of adopting a &quot;seriously defective&quot; process to measure the capacity of local councils to take in child refugees, after it emerged many local authorities were not properly consulted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK refused entry to 130 child refugees due to administrative mistake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government announced in early February that it was to close the Dubs scheme after accepting just 350. It later admitted that an &quot;administrative error&quot; led to 130 places for child refugees offered by local councils not being taken into consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of Information requests </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">submitted by </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">later showed that under the National Transfer Scheme, councils had voluntarily offered to accept 1,572 more children than they were currently supporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, Help Refugees asked the court to order the Secretary of State to consult local authorities again, urging that the Government reopen the Dubs Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the closure of the scheme has been described as &quot;shocking&quot; and &quot;shameful&quot; by MPs and campaigners, the High Court judgement confirmed the Dubs Amendment will remain closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruling on the case on Thursday morning, the Divisional Court said there was nothing that could show that the consultation process or the consideration of the results was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not prepared to hold that arrangements have not been made as soon as possible for this is not something within the control of the UK Government,&quot; the judge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court accepted the Home Office's argument that &quot;the process of deciding who should be transferred was not one to which normal considerations of procedural fairness could realistically apply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Alf Dubs, who himself was a child refugee, told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; by the verdict, warning that the closure of Dubs will only lead to more children in precarious situations, with many falling prey to child traffickers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We went into this with high hopes. Based on the evidence I'm really quire surprised. I've spoken to lots of local authorities who are willing to take in more child refugees,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm hoping the appeal will work. I've been in Calais and Greece recently and this only means more children will be living in the woods with their lives are on hold. More will turn to illegal routes and the traffickers will have field day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These youngsters don't escape that there's a pull factor, as argued by Theresa May. I don't think the people living in the horrors of Syria, and caught up in conflicts in countries like Ethiopia and Eritrea come here because of Dubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've met some of the children who have come across through Dubs and they're doing really well, one wants to do some work with me in Parliament, another one got top marks in school. I was given the warm welcome in Britain years ago and we should still be offering this to child refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the verdict, Josie Naughton, founder and CEO of Help Refugees said they were&quot;bitterly disappointed&quot; by this result, and said the charity intends to appeal the Court's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the time our litigation was issued, not a single child had been transferred to the UK under the Dubs Amendment. Transfers began under the pressure of this litigation and under the pressure from campaigners and parliamentarians,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've unearthed 130 extra places, which the government eventually admitted it had overlooked. These places for children are needed now more than ever. There are young unaccompanied children sleeping rough in Europe completely unprepared for the coming Winter. We intend to appeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;This judgment has confirmed that the consultation conducted last year on the Dubs Amendment and its implementation was lawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We remain committed to transferring 480 children from Europe to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act. We have accepted further referrals this year and transfers are ongoing. We will continue to work closely with EU partners and local authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In addition, our wider focus remains helping those in need of international protection in the region, which is why we have committed to resettle up to 23,000 refugees from the region - almost 9,000 are already rebuilding their lives in the UK - and pledged &pound;2.46bn to the humanitarian response to the Syria conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sri Lankan government has slammed a group of radical Buddhist monks who attacked Rohingya refugees as 'animals', pledging action against police who failed to protect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rajitha Senaratne, a cabinet spokesman, said the government condemned Tuesday's storming of a UN safe house where 31 Rohingya refugees, including 16 children and seven women, had been given shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'As a Buddhist I am ashamed at what happened,' Senaratne told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Mothers carrying very young children were forced out of their safe house which was attacked by a mob led by a handful of monks,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mob broke down the gates of the multi-storied building near the capital Colombo, smashing windows and furniture as frightened refugees huddled together upstairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no reports of casualties among the refugees, who were later taken to another location, but two police officers were wounded and admitted to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'This is not what the Buddha taught. We have to show compassion to these refugees. These monks who carried out the attacks are actually not monks, but animals'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senaratne said police had been ordered to take disciplinary action against officers found to have failed to control the mob.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is not what the Buddha taught. We have to show compassion to these refugees. These monks who carried out the attacks are actually not monks, but animals,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sri Lanka's extremist Buddhist monks have close links with their ultra-nationalist counterparts in Myanmar. Both have been accused of orchestrating violence against minority Muslims in the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the monks who stormed the building posted a video on Facebook filmed by his radical group Sinhale Jathika Balamuluwa (Sinhalese National Force) as he urged others to join him and smash the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'These are Rohingya terrorists who killed Buddhist monks in Myanmar,' the monk said in his live commentary, pointing to Rohingya mothers with small children in their arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 31 Rohingya refugees were rescued by the Sri Lankan navy five months ago after they were found drifting in a boat off the island's northern coast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had been living in India for several years before leaving a refugee camp in Tamil Nadu state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN High Commissioner for Refugees expressed alarm over Tuesday's attack and urged Sri Lankans to show empathy for civilians fleeing persecution and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost half a million Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh since August 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have been the target of decades of state-backed persecution and discrimination in the mainly Buddhist country, where many view them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAST Friday marked the fourth anniversary of the brutal South Sudanese conflict. And although the march of people fleeing violence - arriving exhausted, traumatised and laden down with their possessions at Uganda's border &shy;- may have slowed to around 400 people a day, this is still Africa's largest refugee crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its height 2,000 people arrived daily, many having experienced or witnessed horrors they will never forget - civilians have been murdered, raped and villages burned to the ground. Uganda, where the government has long held a welcoming policy towards refugees granting them plots of land and granting freedom of movement rights not found elsewhere, offers the sanctuary they are longing for. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this, life as a refugee is tough. Some 287,400 South Sudanese refugees are living in Bidi Bidi settlement in the West Nile region of the country, considered the largest refugee camp in the world. The settlement is very dusty, the roads unpaved and with limited shade or cover where temperatures regularly reach 45 degrees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In total, Uganda now hosts more than one million South Sudanese refugees, 80 per cent of them women and children. As the protracted war continues - it broke out when the struggle for political power in the south erupted into violence in 2013 - there is no prospect of them returning home any time soon. Gradually the makeshift shelters of tarpaulins and mud huts are becoming semi-permanent housing and the need for more than emergency aid grows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace Becton, the charity Mercy Corps West Nile programme manager, who oversees work with the South Sudanese refugees of the area, has watched the reactions of those finding a place of safety. &quot;Most people have walked for three or four days to get here,&quot; she says. &quot;They are exhausted, hungry, thirsty and have experienced significant trauma. At first they experience a sense of peace - there are no bullets here, no conflict, they are safe from harm. But once people settle in they realise how difficult it is going to be to rebuild their lives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They start to feel frustrated, they are left in limbo. It is particularly hard for the young people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, she says, is where Mercy Corps comes in, offering financial support to help people to start small farms - growing local crops of cassava, white sorghum, sesame and maize - and other small businesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity offers training, tools and seeds, puts refugees in touch with Ugandan farm agents and is also running an innovative project offering grants to mixed groups of refugee and Ugandan farmers, working side by side. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ugandans we have spoken to tell us the benefits are mutual,&quot; she says, explaining that some &quot;host farmers&quot; have unused land which can be brought back into use with the help of the often highly-skilled refugee farmers, as well as the financial backing of the charity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also remember when Ugandans were refugees [it's brutal military dictatorship ended in 1979], so they feel compelled to welcome them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiko, a 26-year-old Ugandan and Guo from South Sudan, who are working together as part farmers' group in Bidi Bidi, have experienced the benefits. Guo arrived in October 2016 from Kajo Keji, where she was a farmer, after walking with her four children for a month. Her husband is still in Sudan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I came here because of war,&quot; she says simply. &quot;When they [South Sudanese military] find you, they want to shoot you. We lost a lot of our brothers. To get money here, especially as a woman, is a very big problem.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the flexibility of the programme is helping her to piece her life back together. &quot;My life has improved [in the last year] because we are now in the group and we have friends with the nationals (Ugandans) and we can communicate with them,&quot; she adds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiko also sees the advantages of &quot;sharing and staying together&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can help us, we can also help them,&quot; she says. &quot;Since they have a hardship in their mother country, they have to feel at home in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in Bidi Bidi, 60-year-old Tabu says she and her family walked for days to reach the border with Uganda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was terrible&quot; she says, self-conscious suddenly of the missing finger on her hand where it was hit by a bullet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had waited there [in South Sudan] I would have died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, however, with the help of a grant from Mercy Corps she has set up a stall in the settlement selling dried fish, onions and coffee. Life is still not easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tabu's small house, constructed with UNHCR plastic sheeting, leaks in the rain and blows off in the wind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tabu and her husband require medicine and the food is never plentiful. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians must keep the British public on side to ensure refugees are dealt with humanely, the Lords has heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former minister Lord Dubs, who arrived in the UK as a child having fled the Nazis, added he believes public opinion is in favour of offering help despite a ``few abusive tweets''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labour peer's remarks came as the Lords considered proposals to allow refugees in the UK to seek permission to be joined by members of their wider, but still close, family.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other measures in the Refugees (Family Reunion) Bill, moved by Liberal Democrat Baroness Hamwee, include reinstating legal aid for refugee family reunion cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during the Bill's second reading, Lord Dubs told peers: ``I believe firmly we have got to keep public opinion on our side if we're going to deal humanely with refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I still believe, certainly as regards refugee children but I believe refugees as a whole, that public opinion - if informed of what is going on, if informed of the experiences that refugees have been through - is still by and large on our side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I think it's important to bear that in mind.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: ``I believe on this issue in the Bill, public opinion is certainly on our side. All we have to do is to explain to the public what the position is, how individuals are affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``They won't all come round, I've had a few abusive tweets and things, but on the whole public opinion is supportive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative peer Lord Cormack offered his support to the Bill and outlined how the UK should act post-Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the debate: ``We are moving towards Brexit. I acknowledge it, much as I regret it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``But the one thing we must not move towards is an isolationist position in the continent of Europe. We must remain a leading nation. We are a leading nation with a proud history, welcoming those who are fleeing persecution.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: ``This country has a role which it must not abandon. The family unit is the building block of any society and if we can help to have some family units from those countries which are riven by famine, civil war and strife, we will be living up to our proud history.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Office minister Baroness Williams of Trafford said the Government was listening to concerns about how existing rules are applied, but said there was not a need for a new act of Parliament or statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also confirmed the Home Office was considering whether ``improvements can be made'' to immigration rule 319X, which relates to unaccompanied children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Replying to the debate, Lady Williams said more than 100,000 refugees have been granted permanent residence in the UK since 2010 and also noted more than 24,000 partners and children have been reunited with their refugee family members in the last five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: ``There are rules already in place for extended family of refugees in the UK to support children where there are serious and compelling circumstances, and for British citizens to bring family here - so that there is no need for children, in particular, to make the illegal and dangerous journeys to get to the UK.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister went on: ``I can assure you we are listening to concerns about family reunion and discussing with NGOs how we can make improvements as part of wider asylum and resettlement strategy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lady Hamwee, when opening the debate, had questioned if the law was working in practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the minister, she added: ``With regard to the laws ... exceptional circumstances have actually become normal circumstances so you can't apply the exceptionality factor.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her Bill received an unopposed second reading and will undergo further scrutiny at a later date. But it faces a battle to become law with several parliamentary hurdles still to be cleared.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawyers have hit back at the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, for describing them as &quot;un-Australian&quot; for providing pro bono assistance to asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview on the immigration department's proposed final departure visa, which strips asylum seekers of all support, 2GB radio host Alan Jones put it to Dutton that the behaviour of lawyers who had offered to assist asylum seekers was un-Australian: &quot;Of course it is,&quot; Dutton replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the political correctness out there... It extends into some of our major law firms, where part of their social justice agenda is for pro bono work to be provided... and it costs the taxpayer tens of millions each year.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Advocates and churches vow to fight cuts to asylum seeker support</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton said the government was frustrated by its constitutional obligations. &quot;We can't pass legislation to dispel with that difficulty of the constitution, so we defend these matters, we fight them in the courts and it is incredibly frustrating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the Law Council of Australia, Fiona McLeod SC, said she &quot;utterly rejected&quot; Dutton's comments, which she said were aimed at legal professionals who were simply exercising rights that exist under international and Australian law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is nothing more Australian than ensuring people are subject to the rule of law and have their legal rights protected,&quot; McLeod said. &quot;The Australian legal system reflects fundamental Australian values, including the right to have your case heard, the right to not be arbitrarily detained and the right not to be subjected to cruel or inhumane treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the minister's attack was extraordinary and a break with the Australian tradition of a free and independent legal system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is at loggerheads with lawyers and refugee organisations over plans to strip several hundred asylum seekers and refugees of all government support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaked fact sheets from the government show the immigration department intends to impose a new &quot;final departure bridging E visa&quot; upon about 400 refugees and asylum seekers currently in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known as the &quot;Let Them Stay&quot; cohort, the refugees and asylum seekers were brought to Australia from the Australian-run detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru for advanced medical treatment: for some, following rape, assault, other trauma, or serious and deteriorating mental health issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But also included among the 400 are 37 babies who were born in Australia to asylum seeker parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those issued with notices from the government are recognised refugees, who have been found to have a well-founded fear of persecution and who cannot, legally, be sent to a place of harm. Others are still within the refugee status determination process, while others have been rejected for refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hundred refugees and asylum seekers in that group have been instructed to meet with the immigration department this week and have been told they will be issued with a &quot;final departure bridging E visa&quot; before being returned to Manus or Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They lost all government payments - $300 a fortnight - on Monday and will be given three weeks to leave government supplied housing. Refugees and asylum seekers will have access to Medicare and will be allowed to work, and children will be able to attend school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the visa expires they will be expected to return to either Manus or Nauru, or abandon their protection claim and return to their country of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It costs $573,000 a year to house a single asylum seeker or refugee in offshore detention for a year, according to the government's own audit. The auditor says it costs about $40,000 to have someone supported in Australia on a bridging visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community groups and refugee advocates have condemned the proposed changes as an attempt to coerce people to return to harmful places offshore or abandon entirely their claim to protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef Australia said the government's proposed new visa regimen was punitive and said the impact on children must be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are not reasonable, necessary, or proportionate measures for the government to take,&quot; Unicef Australia's director of policy and advocacy, Amy Lamoin, said. &quot;It is well known that punitive measures are not an effective way to influence positive behaviour. These measures, which remove such critical support, will only increase the risk of negative outcomes like destitution and homelessness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  ACT offers to resettle refugees held in 'inhumane' offshore detention centres</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid groups, community organisations, refugee advocates, church groups, and individuals have all come forward offering assistance to refugees cut off from government support, with offers of rooms, houses, clothes, food, and financial help. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief executive of the Australian Red Cross, Judy Slatyer, said she held grave concern for those asylum seekers who will lose basic assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our view is that people should have their humanitarian needs met while in Australia regardless of legal status; they should never be left destitute in the Australian community. They should have their claims for protection fairly assessed and sustainable solutions must be found for people who need protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Red Cross will expand its emergency assistance for people that are directly impacted and will be working with the many agencies that assist asylum seekers over the coming weeks.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">577 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by right-of-centre German newspaper Die Welt website on 1 December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Report by Ricarda Breyton, Ansgar Graw, Marcel Leubecher, and Flora Wisdorff: &quot;Sharp Criticism of Chancellor's New Refugee Deal&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German politicians and migration experts sharply criticize the Libya refugee deal agreed between European and African countries. At a crisis meeting within the framework of the EU-Africa summit, a package of measures was negotiated under Franco-German leadership on Wednesday [29 November] to evacuate migrants from camps at the Libyan coast. Aid organisations have repeatedly criticised the conditions - torture, rape, extortion - in the camps. Most recently, [US broadcaster] CNN had aired a video allegedly showing an auction of migrants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan agreed by the EU and African countries provides for the transfer of migrants to the neighbouring countries Chad or Niger. A &quot;face-saving&quot; solution to return to their home countries should be found for people who officially are not entitled to asylum. For example, the EU wants to support these people with financial aid. According to German Government circles, Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj agreed to allow people from the UN refugee agency UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) access to the camps in his area of authority. The prospect of the swift evacuation of a first refugee camp in the capital Tripoli was held out as early as on Thursday. The chairman of the African Union, Alpha Conde, said that Morocco had agreed to provide aircraft for the operation. The people in the camp, many of them women and children, lived there in inhumane conditions, sources reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FDP [Free Democratic Party] reacted with disbelief to the new deal. &quot;The spontaneous agreement at the EU-Africa summit reveals that Chancellor Angela Merkel very obviously has not learned from her mistakes in the refugee crisis,&quot; presidium member Alexander Graf Lambsdorff told [the German daily] Die Welt. The Chancellor would act only when under pressure, he stated, pointing out that, &quot;in order to get things moving in Libya, Merkel should have taken up the initiative of French President Macron already in summer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens made similar statements. &quot;I am puzzled. The conditions in Libya and reports about enslaved refugees have been known for quite some time,&quot; said foreign policy expert Omid Nouripour to Die Welt. &quot;Now, first moving images have turned up, and the Chancellor starts getting active.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the European Stability Initiative (ESI), Gerald Knaus, welcomes the &quot;humanitarian evacuation&quot;. But he has doubts about the resettlement plans: &quot;The EU is unable to efficiently manage the refugee camps within its own borders. How should it do so in these transit countries?,&quot; he asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN refugee agency UNHCR will play a major role in creating legal ways of migration from Libya to Europe. &quot;In the medium term, the UNHCR wants to check asylum reasons in Libya and select refugees for resettlement to Europe,&quot; a spokesman told Die Welt, adding that, in the view of the UNHCR, however, &quot;resettlement from Libya to Chad and Niger&quot; might &quot;still be an option for only very few refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IOM told this newspaper that the Central Government in Libya currently operated some 30 camps with about 20,000 migrants. The organisation had &quot;already access&quot; to two out of three of these camps, it said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of refugees detained in Manus Island and Nauru will soon be told they have been accepted for resettlement in the US, the Australian government has confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The cohort of about 50 people is the first to be accepted by the American government under a deal struck between the former president, Barack Obama, and Australia to take up to 1250 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Representatives from the United States Resettlement Support Centre have started to provide some refugees with a decision relating to their US refugee admissions program application,&quot; read a sign at the immigration detention centre, which asked people to be patient.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia offers to pay Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every case is different and moves through the required steps of the process at different speeds. This is only the first group of decisions and only some who have expressed an interest in US resettlement will receive a decision at this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of detainees have received appointment slips with the USRSC for Wednesday and Thursday. It is not yet clear whether the appointments are all to tell people they have been successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, confirmed the reports on Wednesday morning and said the first group of refugees were expected to depart Manus and Nauru &quot;in coming weeks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Processing of other individuals continues and further decisions by US authorities are expected in due course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the refugee resettlement process &quot;would not be rushed&quot; and said he would not comment on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said about 25 people from Nauru and 25 from Manus would be informed of their upcoming resettlement in the US soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; President Trump had some reservations about it but nonetheless, he is honouring the commitment made by his predecessor and I want to thank you for doing so,&quot; he told the Seven Network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal with the US sought to end the indefinite situation for the hundreds of people sent to the offshore immigration detention centres after they attempted to seek asylum in Australia by boat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many refugees have spent years in the Australian-run centres, where they have been exposed to violence, death, and high rates of mental illness and despair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon taking office the new US president, Donald Trump, balked at the arrangement, which he dubbed a &quot;dumb deal&quot;, however he reluctantly agreed to honour it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the deal never required the US to take any refugees - but simply assess them for potential resettlement - sparked some concern, as did an abrupt pause in processing when the US hit its annual immigration cap in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 50 resettlements do not come close to assisting the almost 1,200 people on Manus and Nauru. More than 1,600 - including people who were transferred to Australia for medical treatment - have expressed interest in the US option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has floated a &quot;third country&quot; option for a number of years, but appears no closer to finding one other than the US - which will not cover all required placements - or New Zealand, which the Australian government has rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A $55m deal with Cambodia has largely been seen as a failure, with fewer than 10 transferred there and most abandoning their protection claim after a short time there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul told the Guardian acceptance by the US for resettlement would be &quot;welcome news&quot; for refugees who received it. Most have been on the islands more than four years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis adopted new projects totalling EUR150 million to support refugees and their host communities in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Serbia.<BR><BR>Projects will support the most affected municipalities in the region, agricultural livelihoods and food security, school construction, the upgrading of waste-water systems in areas with high refugee concentration, as well as refugee protection, research and advocacy. The newly adopted assistance package brings the overall amount of projects committed under the Trust Fund to EUR1.2 billion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU Commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations Johannes Hahn commented: 'The actions adopted today by the EU Trust Fund will substantially boost local service delivery and economic development for refugees and host communities in the region. With EUR223 million mobilised by the Trust Fund for Lebanon and Jordan this year alone, the European Union continues to demonstrate its resolve to respond to the needs arising from the Syria conflict, and stand side by side with the refugees and the countries hosting them under difficult conditions'.<BR><BR>The assistance package was adopted today at the EU Trust Fund Board meeting. The board brought together the European Commission, members of the European Parliament, EU Member States and representatives of Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and the World Bank to support Syrian refugees and host communities in the region.<BR><BR>The new EUR150 million aid package includes the following actions:<BR><BR>EUR53 million to support the construction of 10 primary and secondary schools in Jordan and the extension of wastewater networks in areas most affected by the refugee influx;<BR><BR>EUR40 million to strengthen municipalities in Lebanon and governorates in Iraq to improve service delivery, facilitate local economic development and access to municipal investments;<BR><BR>EUR25 million to strengthen agricultural livelihoods and food security among vulnerable refugees and rural communities in Lebanon and Jordan.<BR><BR>EUR20 million for the EU Regional Development and Protection Programme II (RDPP II) to enable better protection, research and advocacy towards finding innovative aid solutions to the protracted displacement in Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon;<BR><BR>EUR12 million to assist Serbia in providing food security and protection needs of migrants and refugees in reception centres.<BR><BR>Background<BR><BR>Since its establishment in December 2014, an increasing share of the EU's support to help Syrian refugees and support Syria's neighbouring countries cope with the refugee crisis is provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian crisis. The Trust Fund reinforces the integrated EU aid response to the crisis and primarily addresses longer term resilience and early recovery needs of Syrian refugees and host communities and their administrations in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.<BR><BR>The Trust Fund is a key instrument to deliver the EU's pledges for the crisis made at the London conference on Syria in 2016 and the Brussels conference in April 2017, and also underpins the special EU Compacts agreed with Jordan and Lebanon to assist them in the protracted refugee crisis. With the new package adopted now, the Fund has delivered in 2017 a total of EUR132 million for Lebanon and EUR91 million for Jordan, more than initially foreseen.<BR><BR>Overall, EUR1.3 billion have been mobilised and pledged from the EU budget and contributions of 22 EU Member States and Turkey. Of the total volume of funds, EUR1.2 billion have now been committed (86%) and EUR544 million have been contracted by the Trust Fund with implementing partners for 29 projects on the ground.<BR><BR>Including the new decisions, the Fund's budget has been allocated to programmes supporting basic education and child protection, training and higher education, better access to healthcare, improved water and waste-water infrastructure, as well as support to resilience, women empowerment and fighting gender based violence, economic opportunities and social inclusion. The scope of the Fund also includes support to internally displaced persons in Iraq fleeing from the interlinked Syria/Iraq/Da'esh crisis, and to provide support in the Western Balkans to non-EU countries affected by the refugee crisis.<BR><BR>For More Information<BR><BR>EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis<BR><BR>Factsheet: EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis<BR><BR>IP/17/5107<BR><BR>Press contacts:<BR><BR>Maja KOCIJANCIC (+32 2 298 65 70)<BR><BR>Catherine RAY (+32 2 296 99 21)<BR><BR>Alceo SMERILLI (+ 32 2 296 48 87)<BR><BR>Lauranne DEVILLE (+32 2 298 08 33)<BR><BR>General public inquiries: Europe Direct by phone 00 800 67 89 10 11 or by email<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An independent east London bakery is offering training to refugee women who find themselves alone and isolated after coming to the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just Bread project is a collaborative scheme between the Refugee Council and E5 Bakehouse in Hackney, which is designed to support the training and employment of refugee women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now training its fifth group, the project aims to settle newcomers to the UK through teaching established bread making techniques in this country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four women previously trained on the course are now employed at E5 Bakehouse's new cafe in Tower Hamlets, which it hopes will be run by refugees in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women currently learning to bake bread on the 10-week course at E5 Bakehouse, with baker Lizzie </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (R)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women are employed at E5 Roasthouse, in Poplar, which opened in September, where they are making around 500 flatbreads a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trainee called Elsa is also making flatbreads for Gourmet Goat, a food stall in Borough Market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She took part in the scheme in 2016 as an Asylum seeker and gained employment at the bakery after making her refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean Kerm, 36, a baker at the Roasthouse, said, &quot;The idea is for the cafe to be run by refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women are trained to make sourdough bread and a range of other skills across the bakery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just Bread is a 10-week training programme that was launched in 2014. Women are trained in sourdough bread making, in addition to skills across the bakery such as kitchen lunch service, pastry, coffee, butter, jam making and milling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women from countries including Iraq, Iran, Ethiopia and Afghanistan are currently in training, and are encouraged to share their own cuisines with one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As many participants of the scheme are &quot;vulnerable&quot;, E5 hopes the classes offer &quot;some way of connecting people as well as building confidence and skills for employment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside the project, E5 runs a monthly subscription service where customers pay to receive bread made by the refugees each week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous trainees are now making and selling flatbreads at the cafe and Borough Market each week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women also take certificates in Health and Safety during the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bakery also organise events and projects to allow trainees to have access to employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants are split half and half between refugees and Asylum seekers. Mr Kerm said it is therefore &quot;important that they have at least one day a week where they are doing some work&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last two years, the trainees produced bread for the immersive cinema experience Secret Cinema.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trainees made and sold chouquettes - similar to profiteroles - at Secret Cinema's live Moulin Rouge event earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the project, Mr Kerm said: &quot;You can really see the difference between when they first come and when they start to relax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some weeks it's a bit harder than others. They are always really positive but we are really aware that some of them are in very hard positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the project does not only work one way - the Roasthouse is also learning from the trainees and has adapted its menu with Middle Eastern recipes in collaboration with the women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are really learning from them,&quot; Mr Kerm said. &quot;The refugees show us how they used to make bread in their countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have their own techniques that we can use in the cafe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Lawton, Integration Manager at the Refugee Council, said: &quot;The refugee women we support through Just Bread have experienced unimaginable trauma and loss and it's vital they feel safe and supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only are these women able to learn new skills and ultimately gain employment, they also build up fantastic friendships with people who have been through the same thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The project has gone from strength to strength and a huge part of that is the wonderful partnership between E5 Bakehouse and the Refugee Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our vision for the project is that one day Just Bread is run entirely by refugee women themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally conceived by campaigner Liz Siena, Just Bread is supported by Andrew Lawton at Refugee Council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by official news agency Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) on 24 October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unirted Nations: A United Nations-supported humanitarian conference has raised more than $344 million to fund critical relief programmes for Rohingya refugees and host communities in Bangladesh. The exodus &quot; which began in late August&quot; continues unabated, making the crisis the fastest growing refugee emergency in the world today. As of Sunday, some 603,000 refugees are estimated to have arrived in Bangladesh and thousands more reportedly remain stranded in Myanmar without the means to cross the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Humanitarian donors have today expressed their solidarity and compassion with the families and communities in need,&quot; Mark Lowcock, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, said on Monday. &quot;These very generous pledges must now quickly translate into life-saving relief for the vulnerable refugees and support to host communities who have been stretched to the limit,&quot; he said. Since the crisis began, UN agencies have ramped up their relief efforts, including conducting a massive immunization campaign that inoculated more than 700,000 people against cholera, as well as providing food assistance to hundreds of thousands of refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the scale of the crisis has overwhelmed the response, and emergency shelters, blankets, clean water, health care and other forms of aid are urgently needed. Adding to the complexity is that Bangladesh was already hosting about 200,000 Rohingya refugees prior to the crisis. &quot;More than 800,000 stateless Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh aspire to a life that meets their immediate needs for food, medicine, water, and shelter. But beyond that, a life that has hope for the future where their identity is recognised, they are free from discrimination, and are able to return safely to their homes in Myanmar,&quot; UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we come together in solidarity, I want to thank Bangladesh and its refugee-hosting communities and the donors for supporting them,&quot; he added. There were a total of 35 pledges made today, including money pledged and committed since 25th August as well as new announcements. Several donors also announced in-kind assistance worth more than $50 million. Fundraising campaigns are also underway in several countries. One such initiative is the UN World Food Programme's app ShareTheMeal, which launched a worldwide campaign on Sunday to raise funds to feed Rohingya refugee children and provide them with vital nutrition with a simple tap on their phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pledging conference was co-organized by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). It was co-hosted by the European Union and the Government of Kuwait. Also speaking on Monday, IOM Director General William Lacy Swing underscored that while sustainable life-saving assistance for the refugee population in Bangladesh needs to be ensured, the root causes of the crisis need to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must urge international leaders to support the peaceful resolution of this decade-long crisis in Myanmar and insist that the authorities create conditions of safety, security and dignity in Rakhine state to one of the world's most persecuted populations,&quot; he said. Adding that the recommendations of the Rakhine Advisory Commission offer a way forward to peaceful co-existence, Swing underscored that the implementation must start immediately and that the first step is to allow humanitarians to resume their work in the northern part of Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Greece, Boris Cheshirkov, told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the UNHCR has heard from refugees who have turned to self-harm in detention. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sahar Mallah, Oxfam's Protection Manager on Lesvos,explained that as part of a program called Pilot Project refugees from certain countries are detained upon arrival - often these refugees are from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and several other African countries. They often don't have access to a lawyer and live in worse conditions than other asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheshirkov said the Hellenic Police may detain asylum-seekers of countries with a &quot;low recognition rate&quot; like the countries MsMallah mentioned. While several dozen nationalities are accommodated in Moria, the highest number of people are Syrian, Iraqi, or Afghan, who have high recognition rates, he explained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum-seekers from countries with a low recognition rate are surprised to find themselves in detention in a country where they were hoping to find freedom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saami El Mahdy*, 26, arrived at Moria in 2016 after being rejected entry by Turkey but because of his nationality - Egyptian - he says he spent over a year in detention where he says he was physically and verbally abused. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr El Mahdy says, through a translator, he repeatedly asked officers and aid workers to explain why hewas being held in the detention camp for so long, but he was never given an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in the detention centre that he started cutting his wrists. Asked what life was like in the detention centre, he turns over his arms, revealing astringof scars on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought about dying,&quot; he said. &quot;Theydeal withhumans like they're animals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr El Mahdy said in detention police officers &quot;hit him and said bad words&quot;. He says officers would beat him for no reason and call him words like &quot;Motherf***er&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam says there have been rising rates of suicidal behaviouracross refugee camps in Greece, with evidence of burning themselves with cigarettes and abusing drugs like Vicodin, Trazadone, and alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mallah said in the summer months, when Moria becomes even more crowded, living conditions worsen. A container appropriate for five people living in it could house as many as twenty. The more people, the worse the conditions get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people say they want to 'end their lives'... 'I end up crying when I smile' or 'Death would be better than this,'&quot; Ms Mallah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rafat Zaghloul*, a friend of Mr El Mahdy'swas alsoheld at the detention centre when he arrived at Moria, says he understands those sentiments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why do they put us in prison? What's the reason? They're crazy,&quot; he says, shaking his head.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers are refusing to leave the centre at the Lombrum Navy Base in Papua New Guinea for fear of their safety outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All staff have left the centre, and there are multiple reports Manus Island locals wielding machetes are looting the site ahead of its closure on Tuesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudanese refugee Abdul Mohammad says asylum seekers and refugees fear for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Some of the locals have come inside and are stealing boxes, fire alarms, the fans, some of them are taking the air-conditioners,' he said from Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Manus Island MP Ron Knight suggested former workers were responsible for stripping bare the facilities because they hadn't been paid entitlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh refugee Mohammad Ohidul Islam said some locals have been throwing rocks at refugees inside the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are really scared,' he said from inside the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said refugees and asylum seekers at the detention centre would be holding a meeting in the afternoon to organise teams for night patrol security shifts, while others sleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food packs were last distributed on Sunday night and detainees are using bins and other objects to catch rain water, with running water and power to be cut off on Tuesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for the roughly 600 men in detention lodged a Supreme Court application in PNG on Tuesday, arguing the group's constitutionally protected human rights were being breached by the removal of basic services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detainees fear they will not be safe at three other facilities they are meant to relocate to around the island's main town of Lorengau, after locals threatened to use violence to stop them from moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extra PNG police and defence forces have been flown into Manus ahead of the closure deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local media have reported PNG Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas as saying the detainees won't be forced to leave the detention centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting prime minister Julie Bishop says refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island will be guaranteed all appropriate services at their alternative accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I understand the PNG government has made arrangements for all essential services to be available at the alternative accommodation - food, water, electricity and medical services,' she told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has little sympathy for those left at the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They have long claimed the Manus (regional processing centre) was a hellhole - but the moment it was to be closed they demanded it be kept open,' he said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's immigration spokesman Shayne Neumann urged the Turnbull government to urgently de-escalate tensions on the island and ensure the safety of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Transferring refugees from one centre to another is not a long-term solution. These people urgently need viable third country resettlement options,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International's Kate Schuetze, who is on Manus Island to observe the closure, said PNG police and defence forces had a chequered history of violence against refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Schuetze pointed to the Good Friday shooting, when nine people were injured after PNG military personnel opened fire on the Manus Island centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG's government has warned Australia it would take no responsibility for 'non-refugees' and people who refused to settle in PNG, saying they were the obligation of the Australian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lombrum centre was forced to close after the PNG Supreme Court ruled in April 2016 that Australia's detention of refugees and asylum seekers there was illegal and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six detainees have died on Manus Island - including one who was murdered - since the offshore detention centre was reopened in 2012.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's bipartisan refusal to resettle any refugees held on Manus Island and Nauru continues to cause physical and psychological harm, and will deliberately and permanently split vulnerable families, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an statement condemning the offshore processing regime, high commissioner Filippo Grandi said Australia had failed to honour a &quot;clear understanding&quot; that vulnerable refugees held offshore with family in Australia could be reunited with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is instead insisting that refugees held offshore must go to America - if accepted - or stay offshore.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Power and water cut off for refugees on Manus as Dutton confirms closure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grandi said Australia must end its &quot;harmful practice&quot; of outsourcing its legal responsibilities to refugees to poorer countries in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia's policy of offshore processing in Papua New Guinea and Nauru... has caused extensive, avoidable suffering for far too long,&quot; Grandi said from Geneva. &quot;Four years on, more than 2,000 people are still languishing in unacceptable circumstances. Families have been separated and many have suffered physical and psychological harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the weekend, both the Labor opposition and the Coalition government reaffirmed that no refugee under Australia's control on Manus Island and Nauru would ever be considered for resettlement in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian understands that between 12 and 20 refugees held on Australia's offshore islands have close relatives currently living in Australia - including husbands, wives, children, siblings and parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significantly larger number, however, have been split for medical reasons - where one or several family members have been moved to Australia after suffering serious injury or illness, while family members remain offshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Families will be permanently split by the policy shared by the Coalition and Labor. The unity and protection of the family unit is a fundamental principle of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last November, the UNHCR reluctantly agreed to assist in the relocation of refugees from Australia's offshore islands to the US but Grandi said it did so &quot;on the clear understanding&quot; that vulnerable refugees with close family ties to Australia would ultimately be allowed to settle there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UNHCR has recently been informed by Australia that it refuses to accept even these refugees and that they, along with the others on Nauru and Papua New Guinea, have been informed that their only option is to remain where they are, relocate to Cambodia or to be transferred to the United States,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This means, for example, that some with serious medical conditions, or who have undergone traumatic experiences, including sexual violence, cannot receive the support of their close family members residing in Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Offshore detention cost taxpayers $5bn in four years - and asylum seekers remain in limbo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR said that - in order to avoid prolonging the ordeal of those on offshore islands - it had been left with no other choice but to support the relocation of all refugees on PNG and Nauru to the US, even those who had close family members living in Australia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no doubt these vulnerable people, already subject to four years of punishing conditions, should be reunited with their families in Australia. This is the humane and reasonable thing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Australian government's decision to deny them this possibility is contrary to the fundamental principles of family unity and refugee protection, and to common decency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unusual for the high commissioner to personally comment on Australia's asylum policies: Grandi's previous comments have been on displacement and violence in Myanmar and large-scale forced migration in Africa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grandi reiterated the UNHCR's long-held position that resettlement in PNG or Nauru was &quot;wholly inappropriate&quot; and did not meet international standards for protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged Australia to clear both Manus Island and Nauru of the refugees it has sent there, and to abandon the policy of offshore processing. He said Australia had a proud humanitarian tradition and that the UNHCR recognised and supported the need to save lives at sea and provide alternatives to dangerous journeys and exploitation by smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said offshore processing was neither a feasible nor legal solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a fundamental contradiction in saving people at sea, only to mistreat and neglect them on land,&quot; he said. &quot;I urge Australia to bring an immediate end to the harmful practice of offshore processing, offer solutions to its victims, for whom it retains full responsibility, and work with us on future alternatives that save lives at sea and provide protection to people in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Alleged people smuggler extradited from Indonesia to Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a time of record levels of displacement globally, it is crucial that all states offer protection to survivors of war and persecution, and not outsource their responsibilities to others. Refugees, our fellow human beings, deserve as much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Jane McAdam, director of UNSW's Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, and the recipient of the 2017 Calouste Gulbenkian Prize for human rights, said the high commissioner choosing to personally comment on Australia's policies was evidence of the seriousness of the UNHCR's concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The right to family life is universally recognised in human rights law, and the right to family unity is an inherent part of this. Australia's offshore processing policy violates this right, and in addition is causing extreme psychological suffering that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, which also violates international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the High Commissioner notes, Australia's refusal to let family members reunite is not only legally wrong, but is also unreasonable and contrary to common human decency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a series of questions regarding offshore processing, a spokeswoman for the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, directed the Guardian to a Sunday television interview where the minister was asked whether there was any contingency under which the government might change its policy and allow any refugees currently held offshore to come to Australia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. People will not be coming to Australia,&quot; Dutton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite consistent revelations of physical violence - including murder - sexual abuse of women and children, allegations of torture by guards, medical neglect leading to death and catastrophic rates of mental health damage, self-harm and suicide attempts, both of Australia's offshore processing centres remain operational after four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US resettlement deal - touted by both the government and opposition as the resolution of Australia's offshore regime - remains uncertain. No one has been resettled under the plan and US officials recently left the offshore islands once the country hit its cap for accepting refugees for this year. The quota resets in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US is under no obligation to take a single refugee and, even if it does select some for resettlement, the Australian government says it will not be enough to clear the camps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of the man, whose name the Guardian has chosen not to publish at the request of his family, was found on the grounds of the Lorengau hospital, where he had been sent after a previous suicide attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was facing charges of rape following an alleged assault at a motel in Lorengau earlier this year. The matter was still to come before court and he intended to plead not guilty and to defend the charges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was a Sri Lankan Tamil and had been formally recognised as a refugee, and was legally owed protection. Staff on the island said he had been acutely mentally ill for months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamshiripour had also been suffering acute mental illness for more than a year, and his deteriorating condition had been consistently raised with senior IHMS and Australian Border Force officials, with pleas for intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said authorities on Manus Island were unable to assist refugees who were physically or mentally unwell after four years in detention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This death is criminal neglect. The evacuation of Manus and Nauru is now a more urgent priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, the Australian government agreed to pay $70m in compensation to refugees held on Manus Island  for their illegal detention in dangerous and damaging conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent death from within the Australian-run offshore immigration regime has brought renewed calls for an immediate end to offshore processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australia director of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said Australia's &quot;experiment in human suffering&quot; needed to end immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By October 31, Australia intends to force people to move from the main detention centre on Manus to the transit centre where this man lived,&quot; she said. &quot;His death should make the Australian government wake up and realise that forcibly transferring people to another facility with even worse healthcare facilities is not the solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kate Schuetze, Pacific researcher at Amnesty International, said Australia had an obligation to protect the refugees it had sent offshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fairest and quickest way to ensure safety for all remains bringing them to Australia to process their asylum claims, and welcome refugees into our community,&quot; she said. &quot;This death comes only a few days after a small number of refugees were offered asylum in the United States, making the situation increasingly desperate for those who are left behind in Australia's offshore processing centres.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Law Centre's Daniel Webb said the latest death was yet further demonstration that Nauru and Manus Island were unsuitable for resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It becomes more and more clear, with every death and with every violent attack against innocent people in our care, that the only humane and responsible way forward is to immediately evacuate everyone trapped on Nauru and Manus to safety in Australia. Otherwise, further tragedy is inevitable,&quot; Webb said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If our government then wants to prowl around the globe trying to find safe third countries, fine. But after four years of suffering and death, it is cruel and irresponsible to leave innocent people in danger any longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medicsvolunteering in northern France have warned that growing numbers of children and adults are being diagnosed with the condition, with new cases emerging every day and the severity reaching levels worse than they have ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 700 refugees, including more than 120 unaccompanied children, are currently sleeping rough in Calais and Dunkirk. Following the demolition of the Jungle camp last year, any makeshift shelters or settlements have been destroyed by police, leading to a situation where refugees are sleeping in bare woodland and often exposed to damp, insanitary and cold conditions for long periods of time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees 'beaten, abused and tear-gassed as they sleep', report shows</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Turvey, a medical student volunteering with charity Help Refugees in northern France, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he is seeing multiple cases of trench foot everyday, and estimates that at least half of refugees in the region are suffering from the condition or severe fungal infections on their feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of feet problems, especially as this summer has been very wet. I've seen trench foot in a few of the places I've worked in, but the cases of it here are the worst I've ever seen,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is often combined with athletes' foot, and people are also suffering from really bad feet fungal infections. It's like when you go to the swimming pool and get soggy fingers, but on another level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The term &quot;trench foot&quot; originally stems from the condition suffered by soldiers in trenches during the First World War, which were coincidentally quite prominent around Calais and Dunkirk. It occurs when feet are exposed to water for weeks on end and unable to dry out, leading them to become numb, change colour and swell, and, if left untreated, can cause gangrene and possible foot amputation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees are exposed to damp, insanitary and cold conditions for long periods of time(May Bulman)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seeing trench foot on a soldier in a war is one thing, but seeing it on a 15-year-old boy or a six-year-old girl with it is completely unacceptable in the modern world, let alone in a developed country like France,&quot; Mr Turvey continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The potential for complications of gangrene and surgical debridement as the cases become more severe is highly likely, and it's likely to happen at some point, especially with winter and colder wetter nights in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've known ofcases of trench foot cropping up here and there in the recent decades, often among homeless populations, but nowhere near on the scale that is being seeing among refugees in northern France, particularly with the torrential rain this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of refugees return to 'secret camps' near Calais</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turvey, who worked in the Jungle last year before the site was demolished, said spending prolonged periods of time outside also means refugees were suffering from scabies and pressure sores from sleeping on hard ground, as well as wounds caused by attempts to mount lorries in the desperate pursuit to reach the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of refugees, including kids, have got pressure sores around their groin area and on their bottoms from where they've been sleeping on hard ground and bushes. Some of them have got really serious from where they've become infected,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's also a lot of Leishmaniasis, a tropical skin infection that gives them angry-looking ulcers that will leave life-long scars. And we do a lot of wound management, from grazes from falling over on the motorway to getting caught on barbed wire, to getting hit by trucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Jungle, there were several medical caravans, where volunteers were able to give people relevant medication where they could and write medical referral letters to push people onto clinics. But the absence of a fixed point and a lack of resources has meant medical volunteers are now limited to working from the back of car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sleeping on hard ground can cause pressure sores and scabies (May Bulman)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no means of cleaning their clothes except in dirty water, and not enough socks to go around in the charity donations, refugees are routinely wearing damp clothing, causing trench foot and other conditions to worsen. Any attempts to provide treatment for skin infestations such as scabies are not working, because, on returning to the squalor, people are re-infected within days or weeks, volunteers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French state medical services generally refuse to treat refugees with conditions that are not immediately life-threatening, and people are reportedly often ignored or escorted out by police when they go to local hospitals suffering from trench foot and other conditions, which in turn makes many unwilling or afraid to go back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, I saw a group of boys who had been refused treatment in A&amp;E the night before. They had quite serious conditions, but the doctors and medical staff wouldn't see them,&quot; Mr Turvey said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calais: 'Dogs are allowed in cars here, but refugees not'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It happens a lot. They get kicked out and the police might get called. They're then scared they will be arrested or hurt by the police, so a lot of them won't take our instructions to go to hospital. We're then stuck in this situation where we're diagnosing conditions that are going to progress, but aren't able to get them treated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with their rapidly declining physical health, the mental wellbeing of refugees in the Calais region is said to be at an all-time low, with self-harm becoming increasingly common among both adults and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical professionals and voluntary child protection officers told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people frequently have self-inflicted razor blade cuts and cigarette burns on their skin. Unaccompanied minors are a particular concern, with the number displaying destructive behaviours rising at an alarming rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jungle camp offered spaces to relax and for children, but now people are always on the move (May Bulman)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandy O'Brien, who's been volunteering with the Refugee Youth Service for more than a year, said: &quot;Self harm is really, really common. The majority of kids display destructive behaviours towards themselves, whether it's smoking, drinking, or the more serious cases of serious self harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're seeing kids who very obviously have signs of depression, very low moods, and the longer that kids are here, the more these behaviours become predominant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She explained that when young people first arrive in Calais, they are often unaware of the challenges it will entail, but begin to show a &quot;slow deterioration of spirit and positivity&quot; as they become increasingly tired and worn down, leading them to turn to escapist behaviours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking for control often leads to the self harm. They're in control of nothing here. They're moved on by the police and pepper sprayed by them. They're constantly on the move,&quot; she continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Jungle camp there were spaces they could go to relax and spaces they could be around other children, but now that there's no camp there's just this big blurriness. There's no outside and inside, they're just constantly in motion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities vow to keep giving food to Calais refugees despite ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Refugee Youth Service currently has around 130 under-18s on their database, including between 40 and 50 15-year-olds and around a dozen who are aged 13, while the rest are either 16 or 17. There is also an eight-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl on the database who are sleeping rough accompanied by their mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even just tracking the kids is so much harder than it was before. Before, you had a shelter number, you had groups of friends that would always come,&quot; Ms O'Brien said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now simply trying to keep hold of how many kids we have takes up so much of our time, taking away from the more important stuff. They should all really be having daily check-ins with someone, but it's just not a service we're able to provide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of July, the French government said it would provide water and sanitation to displaced people in Calais and open two reception centres away from the port after a court ordered it to end the inhuman treatment of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the authorities announced that they had delivered on these pledges, but while a number of sanitation facilities have been put in place, volunteers said it is still the &quot;bare minimum&quot; and is not sufficient for more than 700 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mobile water tank with 10 taps was installed, which is open for five hours a day, and 10 portable toilets were placed at the distribution point, but with no hygiene items provided. Two showers have also been installed at the hospital, but are limited for the use of women, children and those with recognised health conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annie Gavrilescu, regional manager forHelp Refugees, said: &quot;The Calais authorities seem to be making efforts to improve living conditions for 750 refugees in Calais, but the provisions so far are absolutely minimal and tokenistic. The court order has not been meaningfully implemented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the Prefecture of the Nord-pas-de-Calais region said: &quot;Mobile facilities have been provided to improve conditions for migrants, while maintaining the objective reaffirmed by the public authorities and validated by the administrative judge not to reconstruct a camp in the Calais region and to avoid an uncontrolled influx of migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In addition, a shower facility already exists for the most vulnerable people (sick, women, children, the elderly, disabled people), which will be expanded before the end of August and will be accessed on the guidance of social workers or public health actors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These installations are not fixed; they can evolve according to realities and needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SYRIAN refugees will be given a sevenbedroom home in one of the most desirable parts of Britain, it was revealed last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spacious property - worth an estimated &pound;400,000 - is in Home Secretary Amber Rudd's constituency of historic Rye, East Sussex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The furnished end-of-terrace home has been empty for two years but is now reserved for &quot;imminent arrivals&quot; by Rother Council, which has 1,132 people waiting for social housing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is part of the Government's plans to speed up the resettlement of people fleeing the war-torn country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the controversial move has divided the coastal town. One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: &quot;I think it's absolutely disgraceful when people are homeless. Maybe a family with three or four children could have that house or veterans. I don't think this should be allowed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property, close to the harbour and with on-street parking, was previously used as accommodation for needy young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dream Sanctuary Group, the landlord, said refugees will be moved in under the care of Rother District Council as part of the Government's Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme. They are expected within weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukip home affairs spokeswoman Jane Collins said: &quot;What more proof do we need of the Government not putting British people first? &quot;The UK has always assisted genuine refugees and should continue to do so but the simple facts remain that people who are British, who have paid their taxes and contributed to the system, should be the first priority of both local and central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is about fairness. Most people in this country can only dream of living in a seven-bedroom house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the people waiting for social housing, 158 want three-bedroom homes, 31 are looking for four-bedroom properties, six need five bedrooms and one is waiting for a six-bedroomed house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has committed to resettling 20,000 refugees from the Middle East and north Africa by 2020. More than 7,000 Syrians have already arrived. The UK has pledged &pound;2.46billion towards the humanitarian crisis. Ms Rudd said: &quot;It is vitally important we focus our support on the most vulnerable refugees in the region who have fled the atrocities in Syria, whatever their nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am proud that the UK is continuing to be proactive and by expanding the scheme we are making sure our doors continue to remain open to the people who most need our help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night a spokesman for Rother Council said: &quot;Like councils across the country we need to provide housing for refugees fleeing the civil war to play our part to meet targets laid down by central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the property was not being used we asked the housing association if they could make it available as accommodation for Syrian refugees, which they have agreed to do. There are currently no refugees in the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We currently have no families on our housing list who require a sevenbedroom house so allocating this property to refugees is not depriving a family of the property they require.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon Clark, of Sanctuary Group, said they were approached by the council to make the accommodation available for Syrian refugees. He said: &quot;The council will be leading on the allocation of refugees to the property which will be provided with essential furnishings provided by a charity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE in four Syrian refugees who arrived in the UK in the past two years has settled in Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 7,055 people have fled to the UK since a scheme to resettle refugees from the war-torn country was expanded in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now figures show that 1,800 of the total have made Scotland their home. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the first to arrive, selected from refugee camps in the Middle East, found a new home on Bute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 28 adults and 31 children were transferred to the island, with one refugee opening a barber's shop just over a year after he fled his homeland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures have been published days after it was revealed the UK Government has not taken in any child refugees under the Lord Dubs scheme this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Macpherson, SNP MSP for Edinburgh Northern and Leith, said: &quot;It's excellent that Scotland has welcomed over a quarter of those Syrian refugees who have arrived in the UK since 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But more needs to be done in what is an off-the-scale humanitarian crisis that's  difficult to comprehend here at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent all-party inquiry revealed that the UK public would not tolerate the UK Government turning away from this humanitarian crisis if they were more aware of what was happening. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It also reported that UK ministers have done 'as little as legally possible' to help unaccompanied lone children who have fled war and conflict, which has left them vulnerable to trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time for the UK Government to significantly step up its refugee resettlement efforts in what is possibly the worst humanitarian crisis since the Second World War.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Programme was set up with a target of resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees in the UK by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One group of refugees moved to Bute, where many praised the welcome they had received in Scotland and Rothesay in particular after reports that some families were not happy on the island. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mounzer Darsani, 32, opened Scotland's first Syrian barber shop in May this year. He said at the time: &quot;My family and I love living on Bute and the people here have been so welcoming and friendly towards us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK immigration minister Brandon Lewis will visit Italy and Greece this week in an attempt to address the delay in lone children being taken into the UK under the Dubs amendment. The measure was passed in 2016 amid a campaign to bring to Britain 3,000 lone refugee children stuck in camps in Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers initially estimated local authority capacity at 350 but extended it to 480 in April after saying there had been &quot;an administrative error&quot; in the figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office has confirmed that only 200 children were transferred under Dubs in 2016 after the closure of the Calais camp and 280 local authority places remain unfilled. But not a single extra lone child refugee has been brought to the UK this year, and Mr Lewis suffered cross-party criticism in the House of Commons last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said it was difficult not to see the Government's response as anything more than lip-service. He wanted to know when the &quot;measly commitment&quot; of 480 would be met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lewis said he had spoken to officials in Greece and Italy to speed up the process and would now go in person. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the transfers must take place in line with the national laws, they must take place safely and they must be in the best interests of each child,&quot; he told MPs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GENEVA, Switzerland -- Libya continues to present one of the most complex mixed migration situations in the world, with refugees traveling alongside migrants through perilous routes, surviving dangerous desert crossings and abuses that include sexual violence, torture, detention in inhumane conditions and abductions for ransom. All this before they even embark on the deadly sea passage to Italy, where the risk of dying is one in 39. Libya is also in the middle of a conflict that has displaced hundreds of thousands of Libyans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">While irregular mixed migration movements may represent challenges for states, detention is not the answer. As a refugee protection agency, UNHCR is opposed to the routine detention of refugees and displaced persons and has been very outspoken, including at the highest level, on the appalling conditions in which refugees and migrants are being held in Libya's detention centres. During a recent visit to Tripoli, for example, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, met refugees and migrants in detention centres and expressed his &quot;shock at the harsh conditions in which refugees and migrants are held&quot;, adding that no refugees or asylum seekers should be detained.<BR><BR>At the same time, UNHCR is currently negotiating with the Libyan authorities the establishment of an open reception centre that would allow refugees and asylum seekers freedom of movement, giving priority to the most vulnerable among them. In this reception centre, UNHCR could provide registration, accommodation, food, social services, counselling and support to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, and solutions in third countries for the most vulnerable.<BR><BR>UNHCR is working to assist and protect over 535,000 people in Libya, including over 226,000 Libyans displaced by conflict, 267,000 Libyans who have now returned to their homes but continue to be in a vulnerable situation and 42,834 registered refugees and asylum-seekers.<BR><BR>While expressing concern about the conditions in detention centres, UNHCR considers it important to maintain a dialogue with the relevant authorities in Libya to ensure access, distribute life-saving assistance and advocate for enhanced access to screening, identification and registration, as well as for measures preventing risks of sexual and gender-based violence.<BR><BR>&quot;We conduct regular visits to official detention centres in order to provide life-saving assistance,&quot; explains Roberto Mignone, UNHCR Representative for Libya. &quot;Our presence in these detention centres does not qualify as an endorsement of these places nor of what happens there. It is our duty, however, to provide refugees and asylum seekers with help and advocate for their protection, including when they are in detention. This year, UNHCR and partners have conducted 658 visits to detention centres. Thanks to our combined efforts, some 1,000 refugees and asylum seekers have been released from these places.&quot;<BR><BR>In Libya, UNHCR works to improve the situation of hundreds of thousands of civilians affected by the conflict. It also works to provide international protection, humanitarian assistance and solutions to persons of concern who are living in the country, or are in transit towards Europe. It works in close coordination with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other partners. The constraints they face in Libya are many, including limited access throughout the country due to the current security situation. Still, UNHCR is making every effort to scale up its presence and response inside Libya through national staff, partners, and the regular rotational presence of international staff, who are currently operating from Tunis.<BR><BR>Given the urgent humanitarian needs and appalling conditions in detention centres, it is essential that UNHCR continues to be engaged in the provision of life-saving assistance, protection and solutions, as well as advocacy for alternatives to detention, as the first and foremost priority.<BR><BR>&quot;The assistance UNHCR provides in detention centres helps alleviate the suffering of detainees,&quot; said Mignone. &quot;We provide hygiene kits, blankets, slippers and clothes. Additionally, through our partner IMC (International Medical Corps), we are able to provide primary health care to those in need, which is often the only medical assistance detainees have access to.&quot;<BR><BR>Distributed by APO on behalf of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SENIOR official at the United Nations yesterday called on the UK Government to double the amount of refugees it currently takes in under resettlement programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant commissioner at the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), Volker Turk, said accepting around 10,000 refugees a year would be a &quot;step change&quot; for the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added there was a need for countries all over the globe to step up and take notice of the continuing crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in London after negotiations with UK ministers, Turk said he was hopeful the Government's response would be &quot;significantly&quot; expanded after 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has committed to take in 20,000 refugees by 2020 under a scheme set up to cover people fleeing the Syrian conflict, with 5453 granted humanitarian protection under the programme in the year ending March 2017, and 3000 vulnerable children and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week it emerged that Scotland welcomed more than a quarter of all Syrian refugees who have arrived in the UK in the past two years. More than 7000 refugees have arrived in Britain through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Programme since 2015. Of those, 1800 have settled north of the Border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scotland has a long history of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers from all over the world,&quot; said Scottish Government Equalities Secretary Angela Constance .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have welcomed over 1800 refugees through the Syrian resettlement programme - nearly a quarter of all those who have come to the UK according to the latest Home Office statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have always said that Scotland will do everything we can to help in this humanitarian crisis and we agree with the UN that the UK Government can and should do more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK Immigration Minister, Brandon Lewis defended Britain's record, saying it had resettled more refugees than any other country in the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have pledged to resettle up to 3000 vulnerable children and family members from the Middle East and North Africa as well as 20,000 Syrians by 2020,&quot; he added. &quot;The Government will consider options post-2020 in due course&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are clear that we do not want to incentivise perilous journeys to Europe, particularly by the most vulnerable. That is why we have invested significantly in the region to address humanitarian needs and reduce migratory flows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turk also hit out at &quot;irresponsible&quot; rhetoric from Western politicians. He praised the response of British communities which have received refugees, but also urged the Government to do more to end detention of asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turk said he wanted to see &quot;significant numbers&quot; of refugees offered the chance of a new life in the UK after 2020, with a resettlement programme open to people fleeing trouble spots around the world, not just Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following his talks with UK ministers, he said: &quot;We had good discussions about possible ideas about what can be done post-2020 and the Government is open to discussing this and to learn the lessons from what is ongoing at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope there will be a regular resettlement programme by Britain past 2020 in significant numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;It would be a step change, it would not just be related to Syria. It would look at where the urgent situations are, to have a certain flexibility in responding to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we have to be very honest about the need for countries to contribute and to step Turk then praised the response of local communities in the UK which had already received refugees and said some rural areas had been &quot;revived&quot; by the new arrivals, adding that he was &quot;very encouraged by the reaction in Britain, by communities at grassroots level&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so amazed when I hear about rural areas in Britain that actually they are so happy that people come to them and it almost revives parts of Britain,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see this also in Britain and I don't think we hear enough about these positive examples,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;whole of society&quot; approach was needed to address the challenges, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about attitudes, it's about engagement, it's about understanding towards the plight of people who end up - because of conflict, because of war, because of persecution - in a situation of distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Britain has a long history of asylum and sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That tradition is absolutely key and it will involve whole communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have the impression that some of the negativity is amplified but we forget about all the positive things that are happening,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turk also hit out at emotionally-charged subjects sometimes being used for short-term political gains.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they immediately vowed to fight on following a ruling against them by two judges in London on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity Help Refugees went to court claiming that the consultation process by which Home Secretary Amber Rudd calculated that only 480 should be accepted was &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had sought court orders to force her to abandon the cap and reopen the consultation process so consideration could be given to allowing more children in.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees announced plans to appeal after Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Ouseley dismissed its application for judicial review, ruling: &quot;Overall, having considered the criticisms made as to the requirements for a fair consultation we are not persuaded that the claimant's case is made out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government lawyers contested the case, arguing that there was no illegality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosa Curling, from the human rights team at law firm Leigh Day, who represents Help Refugees, said: &quot;This litigation has already brought about very significant advances - 130 extra places for vulnerable children were added as the direct result of this litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government was also forced to accept that the children to be transferred under the Dubs Amendment were additional to the children the Government already had to transfer under EU law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our clients continue to believe that the way in which the Dubs Amendment has been implemented is seriously defective. We have sought permission to appeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josie Naughton, founder and chief executive officer of Help Refugees Ltd, said: &quot;We are bitterly disappointed by this result but also very proud of what our litigation has already achieved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;There are young unaccompanied children sleeping rough in Europe completely unprepared for the coming winter. We intend to appeal.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dubs Amendment was to the 2016 Immigration Act and, from May last year, required the Home Secretary to make arrangements to relocate &quot;a specified number&quot; of vulnerable refugee children from Europe based on feedback from local authorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a hearing in June, the judges were told that local authorities were meant, under the Dubs Amendment, to let the Home Office know which areas of the country were ready to take unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the charity claimed there was a Government failure to carry out a full UK-wide consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour peer Lord Dubs, the architect of the Dubs Amendment, who came to the UK as a refugee from the Nazis, has urged ministers to reconsult local authorities, saying that many confused by the process have since &quot;expressed a willingness to take more child refugees&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, Further to Clare Foges's article &quot;Time for a harder line on the migrant crisis&quot; (Aug 7), the UNHCR is very concerned about the thousands of refugees and migrants crossing the Mediterranean. To suggest, though, that the issue can be solved by ending the Refugee Convention that has saved millions of lives ignores the factors driving this flow. Some 84 per cent of the world's refugees are hosted by developing countries. I agree with the need to strengthen aid to them: this has been UNHCR policy for years. More support to such countries is essential. But people smuggling by boat will not stop as long as the desperate have no alternative. This is why resettlement and other legal channels are key, as they give governments better scope to manage the situation and save lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK has provided a leading example on resettlement in recent years, but states need to do more to address the shortfall in lifesaving resettlement places; of 1.19 million places needed this year, only 90,000 are expected to be available globally. volker t&uuml;rk Assistant high commissioner UNHCR Sir, Clare Foges laments that, by using smartphones, those &quot;in the developing world&quot; have &quot;the ability to learn their rights according to international law&quot;. She implies that access to, and knowledge about, one's rights should be a limited commodity. She also argues that the refugee definition is &quot;out of date&quot; and that the line between refugees and economic migrants &quot;is increasingly blurred&quot;. The reality is that the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees sets stringent tests of recognition of persons as refugees: they must be outside their state of nationality and have a &quot;wellfounded fear of persecution&quot; for one (or more) of five convention reasons (race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That millions of people meet the refugee definition is a cogent reason to make access to protection in countries such as the UK easier, not harder; and to extend complementary or subsidiary protection where the 1951 convention definition is too restrictive. dr ruvi ziegler Associate professor in international refugee law, Oxford Sir, Clare Foges seeks to address the pull factors that attract growing numbers of economic migrants from poorer countries to the relatively rich West. However, we also need to deal with the push factors that encourage people to make the long and perilous journey in the hope of winning the better life they can see on their mobile phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way would be to create places of hope within their own countries. The United Nations should invest in creating beacons of hope within those countries using the Hong Kong model: it should lease land from the government in key states with agreements to create a new enterprise city, to be run by the United Nations, with its own government, jurisdiction and laws.

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners have lost a High Court bid to try to force the Government to take in more child refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity Help Refugees wanted the Home Office to lift its cap of 480 children to be given sanctuary in Britain under the Dubs amendment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their lawyers had argued the Home Office adopted a 'fundamentally flawed' consultation when deciding how many youngsters to take in.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had sought court orders to force Home Secretary Amber Rudd to abandon the cap and reopen the consultation process so consideration could be given to allowing more children in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Government lawyers said there had been no illegality, and today the High Court sided with them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a ruling given in London on Thursday, two judges dismissed an application for judicial review by the charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dubs scheme is named after the Labour peer Lord Dubs - who fled the Nazis and on the Kindertransport and was &nbsp;given sanctuary in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme was drawn up at the height of the refugee crisis, when thousands of children were making the perilous journey from the Middle East and north Africa to try to claim refuge in Europe and Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many were camped out in the refugee camp in Calais known as 'The Jungle', and were risking their lives to try to smuggle themselves into lorries and over the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp was eventually cleared by the French authorities, with help from Britain, amid fears it was becoming a dangerous magnet for refugees and was a public health risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme&nbsp;was originally intended to give homes in Britain to 3,000 vulnerable children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in February the Government announced in was closing the scheme having offered far fewer places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was highly controversial and ministers have been accused of ignoring 1,600 offers by local councils to take in children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Dubs and actress Juliet Stevenson were among those who backed the legal challenge.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesman said: 'This judgment has confirmed that the consultation conducted last year on the Dubs Amendment and its implementation was lawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We remain committed to transferring 480 children from Europe to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have accepted further referrals this year and transfers are ongoing. We will continue to work closely with EU partners and local authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In addition, our wider focus remains helping those in need of international protection in the region, which is why we have committed to resettle up to 23,000 refugees from the region - almost 9,000 are already rebuilding their lives in the UK - and pledged &pound;2.46bn to the humanitarian response to the Syria conflict.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green Party, said: 'We will not give up on child refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This ruling is bitterly disappointing, but it does not stop the Government re-consulting with local authorities.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We could still take in more child refugees who are at great risk of abuse and trafficking and I urge Ministers to do so immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Government has won in the court of law on a technicality, but I believe they are losing in the court of public opinion.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Help Refugees are fighting the cause of compassion and common sense and I believe we can make Britain a nation that welcomes, helps, and supports child refugees.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE UK should double the number of refugees it takes in under resettlement programmes, the United Nations has urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior official at the UN's refugee agency said accepting about 10,000 refugees a year would be a &quot;step change&quot; for the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said the Scottish Government echoed the sentiment the UK could and &quot;should do more&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volker Turk, assistant commissioner at the UN High Commission for Refugees, said there was a need for countries around the world to &quot;step up&quot; to address the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has committed to take in 20,000 refugees by 2020 under a scheme set up to cover people fleeing the Syrian conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between the start of October 2015 and the end of March 2017, 7,055 people have been resettled under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One in four of these, a total of 1,800 people, have made Scotland their home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 29 local authorities have received people fleeing the war-town country. Some of the first to arrive, selected from refugee camps in the Middle East, have found new homes on Bute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Constance said: &quot;Scotland has a long history of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers from all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have welcomed more than 1,800 refugees through the Syrian resettlement programme - nearly a quarter of all those who have come to the UK according to the latest Home Office statistics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have always said Scotland will do everything it can to help in this humanitarian crisis and we agree with the UN the UK Government can and should do more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk, who was in London for talks with ministers, said he hoped the Government's response would be &quot;significantly&quot; expanded after 2020, saying &quot;it would be a doubling&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk urged the Government to do more to end detention of asylum seekers and to hit out at &quot;irresponsible&quot; rhetoric from Western politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he wanted to see &quot;significant numbers&quot; of refugees offered the chance of a new life in the UK after 2020, with a resettlement programme open to people fleeing trouble spots around the world, not just Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his talks with ministers he said: &quot;We had good discussions about possible ideas about what can be done post-2020 and the Government is open to discussing this and to learn the lessons from what is ongoing at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope very much that there will  be a regular resettlement programme  by Britain past 2020 in significant numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aspiration was for it to cover 10,000 refugees or more, effectively doubling the current rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;It would be a step change, it would not just be related to Syria. It would look at where the urgent situations are, to have a certain flexibility in responding  to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we have to be very honest about the need for countries to contribute and to step up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turk praised the response of communities which had already received refugees saying some rural areas had been &quot;revived&quot; by the new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was &quot;very encouraged by the reaction in Britain, by communities at grassroots level&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am so amazed when I hear about rural areas in Britain that actually they are so happy that people come to them,&quot; he added. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Churches across Australia will offer sanctuary to any refugees and asylum seekers left homeless and destitute by changes to the government's visa regime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Very Rev Peter Catt, Anglican dean of Brisbane and chair of the Australian Churches Refugee Taskforce, said a network of churches, aid agencies, community groups and refugee advocacy organisations would offer housing, financial support, food, clothing, medicines and other necessities to assist refugees and asylum seekers who have lost the right to government financial support and housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Coalition to cut income support for 100 asylum seekers in Australia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday over 40 men and women went into an appointment with immigration, emerging penniless, without housing, and terrified of returning to harm on Manus and Nauru. Among them were pregnant women and women that came to Australia for treatment after being sexually assaulted on Nauru,&quot; Catt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not stand by and allow them to be made destitute and forced back to danger on Nauru. When this government is cruel, the community will be kind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaked government fact sheets outline a plan for asylum seekers and refugees living in Australia to be given a new &quot;final departure bridging visa&quot;, which would see them lose government financial assistance - currently $300 a fortnight - and evicted from government-supplied housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, 100 single men and women in Australia have been instructed to meet with the immigration department and told they will be subject to the new regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanctuary still exists, we've got aid agencies ready to assist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anglican dean of Brisbane Peter Catt    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 100 are among about 400 refugees and asylum seekers - known as the &quot;Let Them Stay&quot; cohort - who have been brought to Australia from Manus and Nauru for medical treatment, including complex surgery and long-term mental health treatment, or to give birth. Some have been victims of rape and assault offshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 400 also include 116 children, many enrolled in Australian schools, and 37 babies born in Australia to asylum seeker and refugee parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those children, while born in Australia (and, in many cases, having never left the country) are regarded as &quot;illegal maritime arrivals&quot; by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, a network of Australian churches publicly offered sanctuary to asylum seekers and refugees facing return to Nauru and Manus Island. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a long tradition of churches acting as physical places of sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right of churches to provide sanctuary, in which fugitives were immune to arrest, was recognised by English law from the fourth to the 17th century. It no longer has any legal force but is rather observed out of tradition or as a metaphorical safe haven. The right does not exist in Australian law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catt said the government's latest visa changes were politically motivated, and were &quot;really an attempt to get refugees and asylum seekers to go back out of desperation, to starve them into it&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's announcement is really to remind people that if the government does try to remove people by force, then sanctuary still exists, we've got aid agencies ready to assist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catt urged the Australian public to support agencies who had pledged to assist affected asylum seekers and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, enlarged upon the visa changes this week, saying that asylum seekers and refugees had been exploiting the system in Australia, and that &quot;the con is up&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told News Corp, &quot;they were brought to Australia on the premise that once their medical needs were met they would return to Nauru or Manus&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The medical care has been provided and through tricky legal moves they are now prevented from being returned to their country of origin, Manus or Nauru.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said, &quot;in some cases, this con has been going on for years, costing the Australian taxpayer tens of thousands of dollars for each individual&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It costs $573,000 a year to house a single asylum seeker or refugee in offshore detention for a year, according to the government's own audit. The auditor says it costs about $40,000 to have someone supported in Australia on a bridging visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia now attempts not to allow refugees and asylum seekers to be transferred to Australia for required advanced medical care. In internal documents, the government says it tries to prevent medical transfers because of refugees' &quot; propensity &quot; to exercise their rights in the courts and seek injunctions preventing their return to the Australian-run offshore islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 people are on the Overseas Medical Referral list in Nauru. They have been recommended for overseas transfer for medical treatment unavailable on Nauru, but have been refused or not even considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 60 men have been transferred from the Manus Island facility to the PNG capital, Port Moresby, ostensibly for medical treatment. Many, however, have been held in the capital - in a hotel paid for by Australia - for months and do not expect to return to Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, the government agreed to pay $70m in compensation to the Manus Island detainees, who sought damages in the Victorian supreme court for illegally detaining them in dangerous and harmful conditions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REFUGEE Week 2017 was Swindon's biggest and most successful yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost a year ago, the town celebrated the launch of Swindon City of Sanctuary, an organisation seeking to create a culture of welcoming support for those who have fled danger and persecution and now call Swindon home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its launch, City of Sanctuary has held a number of successful events and most recently was the leading force behind Refugee Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lead organiser, Kate Hudson, said: &quot;The purpose of Refugee Week is to raise awareness and celebrate all that is good about diversity in our society. As a group, we feel that this is needed more than ever, and it appears we're not alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The feedback we've had from events like our Global Tea Party has been overwhelmingly positive. We'd love to do it all again next year and would welcome contributions and ideas from others in the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's event began with the Great Get Together, a day of fun for all the family but with a serious message in memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week that followed has been described by organisers as &quot;a whirlwind of art, activity, education and celebration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It included school outreach programmes that reached more than 200 children, gallery exhibitions, dancing, a special radio show, a topical film screening and international themed entertainment throughout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicola Johnson, Swindon City of Sanctuary's Development Worker, said: &quot;It's been an incredible week - organised and supported by the most amazing volunteers. A wonderful celebration of Swindon and the community spirit that can be found here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a few reasons why we have wanted to make Refugee Week a much bigger event in Swindon this year: sharing stories to create better understanding of why people seek refuge and to encourage successful integration, enabling refugees to live in safety and celebrating the valuable contribution they bring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's easy to demonise a group of people, to blame unknown faces for our own misfortunes and struggle. Hopefully events like this create a space for people in Swindon to meet the individuals not just a 'refugee'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me, it was also incredibly poignant, coming so soon after the sad news of Lord Joel Joffe's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was instrumental in getting Swindon City of Sanctuary to where it is today in just a year and a huge support to me in providing funding for my role as Development Worker for Swindon City of Sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugee Week feels very much like a testimony to his work in championing three very meaningful dimensions in his life: human rights, refugees and Swindon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can think of no better way to say thank you and honour his memory than continuing our work to promote a culture of welcome and inclusion as well as providing opportunities to celebrate the wonderful people who live in Swindon and our community which was apparent during Refugee Week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 22, supporters of the refugee community will take to the streets for what has become an annual march of solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's event saw the highest turnout for any political demonstration in the town that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2017 'refugees welcome' march, organised by the Swindon Trades Council, Hope Not Hate and Swindon City of Sanctuary, will set off from Wharf Green at 2pm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of refugees are facing a severe lack of sanitation and police brutality on the border between Italy and France, in what experts say is a situation &quot;worse than the Jungle&quot;, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can reveal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 700displaced people, including scores of unaccompanied children, are currentlyin the Italian city of Ventimiglia. Many of them are living in conditions that are &quot;wholly inadequate&quot;, with an &quot;acute&quot;lack of clean drinking water or sanitation facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New research seen exclusively by </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reveals that intensified brutality from Italian and French police and a lackof accessible healthcare means young refugees also face an &quot;alarming&quot; level of danger coupled with dwindling levels of physical and mental health, with the majority of people unable to access medical care.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris police stealing refugees' blankets in freezing conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers from the Refugee Rights Data Project (RRDP), who carried out the study, said Ventimiglia was one of the worstrefugee locations they had been to, describing the situation as &quot;terrifying&quot; and urging that more must be done to improve the inhumanesituation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The in-depth study surveyed 150 male refugees in the area, one-in-five respondents of whom was under the age of 18, and 90 per cent were there alone without friends or family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority (73 per cent) had been in Ventimiglia for between oneandthree months at the time of the study, after arriving in Libya and travelling through Italy.The largest country group were from Sudan, followed by individuals from Chad, Ethiopiaand Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of women and girls reflects the very small number of female refugees, which researchers said could be attributed to the extent of sex trafficking in southern Italy and North Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes dubbed the &quot;Italian Calais&quot;, Ventimiglia is a well-known transit point for refugees and displaced people trying to enter France. A bottleneckhas developed there in recent years since France declared a state of emergency and closed its borders in 2015, making passage more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closed border meansdisplaced people are making fewer attempts to reach France by train, instead taking their chances withthe so called &quot;Pass of Death&quot; through the mountains, or walking through motorway tunnels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six-in-10 respondents said they had experienced health problems since arriving in Italy, with 44 per cent believing it isdue toliving conditions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samer Mustafa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While 400 to 500 displaced people were hosted in a refugee camp run by the Red Cross camp, an estimated 200 to 300 individuals were destitute at the time of the study, sleeping rough under bridges and by the riverbank, researchers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When questioned about the sanitationin Ventimiglia, the majority of respondents - 85 per cent - said they would use the water in the river, where many go to the toilet, to wash themselves, as well as todrink when desperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six-in-10 respondents said they had experienced health problems since arriving in Italy, with 44 per cent of those believing the health problem had started due to the unhealthy living conditions. Local health care professionals reported a large number of dermatological conditions, including scabies, were widespread due to theunhealthy living conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the scale of both physical and mental health problems among refugees in Venitimiglia, researchers found that only 15 per cent of those with health problems had been able to access medical care - despite efforts by groups such as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly one-in-five (17 per cent) respondents described their health problem as a mental health issue rather than a physical ailment. The vast majority of sufferers had travelled through Libya, and many recounted highly alarming experiences, while others were left with physical injuries that they could not get treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Sudanese man explained that he had lost his brother at sea when their vessel sank, and that he witnessed an infant being shot by Libyans while in his mother's arms in the boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another man said he was feeling unwell because he had bad memories seeing hundreds of fellow refugees shot dead in Libya. There had been some 450 of them to begin withbut only himself and 70 others managed to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While all of the Red Cross camp residents interviewed said they had access to food every day, just 41 per cent of the destitute refugees said they had food every day. Seventy per cent of those with access to food said they could only have one meal per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of safety, the study found that seven-in-10 respondents said they &quot;didn't feel safe at all&quot; in the region. Researchers put this sense of being in danger down to the absence of security measures, as well as &quot;detrimental&quot; living conditions on the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others said they feared being robbed or attacked by other displaced people due to the precarious context, while almost one in 10 cited the risk of violence or sexual abuse by police or Europeans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in Calais suffering trench foot from squalid conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about the biggest risks faced by people passing through Ventimiglia, the vast majority cited dangers related to border crossings (75 per cent), followed by the risk of not having access to sufficient food and water (63 per cent) or medical help (51 per cent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alarmingly,43 per cent of respondents knew of at least one refugee who had died in Italy or at the French border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers state that while it should be acknowledged that many of these respondents were referring to the same incidents, it is worryingthat seven in 10 of these respondents said the persons in question had died by falling down a cliff or mountain when trying to cross the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty-seven per cent cited road accidents as the reason for death, while some 10 per cent of respondents cited health problems as the cause, eight per cent said the death had occurred as a result of violence by the police and three per cent said the death was caused by suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report found that as well as the physical dangers of crossing the border, police brutality was a major danger to refugees, with more than half (53 per cent) of respondents having experienced violence by French police at the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young refugees also face an &quot;alarming&quot; level of danger coupled with poorphysical and mental health, with the majority unable to access medical care </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samer Mustafa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of this was in the form of verbal abusebut 40 per cent of people had also been subjected to physical violence, 36 per cent tear gas,and eight individuals said they had been subject to some form of sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many respondents recalled being exposed to tear gas at the border. One 18-year-old from Sudan told researchers: &quot;When I was crossing the border they caught me and they beat me and they sprayed tear gas. It was the worst thing in the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Sudanese 18-year-old said: &quot;My right shoulder was broken and my neck was injured by French police at the border. There was French army deporting people as well. In Ventimiglia my nose was broken by Italian police at the train station. I was sent back many times to Taranto, I don't feel safe in Italy at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many respondents also said they weresubject to regular racial verbal abuse from local people, werefacing discrimination for being blackand were told they were not welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several refugees reported, on separate occasions, that citizens had thrown buckets of water onto them from their balconies as they walked past on the pavement, while others recounted being denied drinking water in the city centre because they were refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report stated that French CRS riot police are present at Ventimiglia train station on a daily basis, searching trains and carrying out detentions. Recently imposed anti-terror protocols give French police the power to conduct searches up to 20kminside Italy, and to deport individuals across the border.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marta Welander, executive director of the RRDP, who has carried out a large number of refugee research projects, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the accumulation of issues facing refugees in Ventimiglia was &quot;terrifying&quot;, and said it was &quot;one of the worst&quot; research locations she had been to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course the Greek islands are also horrendous and at breaking point but what's so alarming about this situation is the lack of available services,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really trapping people in this bottleneck scenariobut without any access to the services they need. There are charities there, and they are doing what they can, but there's such a lack of resources and they're being restrained by the authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Welander accused the authorities of &quot;resisting&quot; providing help for refugees, and said the French police had been acting illegally by sending children out of the country, despite it being a legal obligation for the state to care for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The French authorities are breaking European directives and are sending kids back from French soil. Once they've already arrived, they should become the responsibility of the French state. This is illegal as far as all of us understand,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We overheard the French police giving children false information. They told them absolute nonsense. They asked if they were European and when they said no they said, 'Wellthen you can't stay in France, don't you know the rules'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The French are a huge part of this problem. They are abusing state-of-emergency powers laws by sending back these kids. No one wants to take responsibility for minors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said the Italian authorities had put many refugee families in danger by closing down a church in the city that could host women and children, which she said led to many women and children simply disappearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is infuriating. That was a safe space for women and children. The local authorities wanted to move them to the Red Cross camp, where there are about 400 men and no security and known for its precarity,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris police stealing refugees' blankets in freezing conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So a lot of them fled and no one knows where they went. The authorities really don't have the best interests of these people at heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Welander went on to say that the dangers and health risks for refugees on the Italian border was more severe than they were in the Jungle camp before it was demolished by the authorities in October last year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's worse than the Jungle. All the positive elements that people could draw from that camp, such as support networks, makeshift health services and a sense of community, simply aren't there,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's much like the way the French authorities are now dealing with the situation in Calais. They're constantly trying to make sure that people don't set up camp and stabilise themselves there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are arriving straight from Libya and a lot of them have experiences of horrendous things there, and then they find themselves in destitution. I got the sense that people are not entirely informed as to why the border is closed and why they can't choose where they apply for asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems quite clear that the current policies are not doing anything to address the situation in a meaningful or long-term way. They're just shifting people around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are people who are highly likely to be developing post-traumatic stressdisorder because of what they lived through in Libya. It's in everyone's interest to provide support or medical care. Whether they're staying in Italy or not, there need to be better services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the findings, Livio Amigoni, of refugee charity Eufemia Infopoint Ventimiglia, said: &quot;After the French declaration of a state of emergency and the tightening of the border in 2015, passage to France has become more difficultbut has not discouraged people to try to cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead, it has driven individuals to try dangerous mountain passes and lethal motorways routes, and the situation also puts many people at the mercy of smugglers and traffickers. Moreover, France holds responsibility for the minors who arrive on French soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite this, French police have been sending minors back on trains from France to Ventimiglia, denying them their right to protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian authorities have been contacted for comment but had not responded at the time of publication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners have expressed their ``bitter disappointment'' after losing a High Court challenge against the Government over the number of unaccompanied child refugees accepted into the UK under the Dubs scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they immediately vowed to fight on following a ruling against them by two judges in London on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity Help Refugees went to court claiming that the consultation process by which Home Secretary Amber Rudd calculated that only 480 should be accepted was ''fundamentally flawed''.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had sought court orders to force her to abandon the cap and reopen the consultation process so consideration could be given to allowing more children in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees announced plans to appeal after Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Ouseley dismissed its application for judicial review, ruling: ``Overall, having considered the criticisms made as to the requirements for a fair consultation we are not persuaded that the claimant's case is made out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government lawyers contested the case, arguing that there was no illegality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosa Curling, from the human rights team at law firm Leigh Day, who represents Help Refugees, said: ``This litigation has already brought about very significant advances - 130 extra places for vulnerable children were added as the direct result of this litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The Government was also forced to accept that the children to be transferred under the Dubs Amendment were additional to the children the Government already had to transfer under EU law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Our clients continue to believe that the way in which the Dubs Amendment has been implemented is seriously defective. We have sought permission to appeal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josie Naughton, founder and chief executive officer of Help Refugees Ltd, said: ``We are bitterly disappointed by this result but also very proud of what our litigation has already achieved.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: ``There are young unaccompanied children sleeping rough in Europe completely unprepared for the coming winter. We intend to appeal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dubs Amendment was to the 2016 Immigration Act and, from May last year, required the Home Secretary to make arrangements to relocate ''a specified number'' of vulnerable refugee children from Europe based on feedback from local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a hearing in June, the judges were told that local authorities were meant, under the Dubs Amendment, to let the Home Office know which areas of the country were ready to take unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the charity claimed there was a Government failure to carry out a full UK-wide consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour peer Lord Dubs, the architect of the Dubs Amendment, who came to the UK as a refugee from the Nazis, has urged ministers to reconsult local authorities, saying that many confused by the process have since ''expressed a willingness to take more child refugees''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees said afterwards that it had lodged an application for permission to appeal against the ruling by Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Ouseley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosa Curling, from the human rights team at law firm Leigh Day, who represents Help Refugees, said: ``This litigation has already brought about very significant advances - 130 extra places for vulnerable children were added as the direct result of this litigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``At the time our litigation was issued, not a single child had been transferred to the UK under the Dubs Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Transfers began under the pressure of this litigation and under the pressure from campaigners and parliamentarians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We've unearthed 130 extra places, which the Government eventually admitted it had overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``These places for children are needed now more than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``There are young unaccompanied children sleeping rough in Europe completely unprepared for the coming winter. We intend to appeal.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We could still take in more child refugees who are at great risk of abuse and trafficking and I urge ministers to do so immediately.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years on, Australia's offshore processing has left some 2,000 people languishing in unacceptable circumstances - causing physical and psychological harm, according to the United Nations refugee agency, which today called for an immediate end to the practice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia's policy of offshore processing in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, which denies access to asylum in Australia for refugees arriving by sea without a valid visa, has caused extensive, avoidable suffering for far too long,&quot; UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said today in a statement.<BR><BR>In light of the dire humanitarian situation that includes separating families, last November the High Commissioner's Office, UNHCR, exceptionally agreed to help relocate refugees to the United States following a bilateral agreement between that country and Australia.<BR><BR>&quot;We agreed to do so on the clear understanding that vulnerable refugees with close family ties in Australia would ultimately be allowed to settle there,&quot; Mr. Grandi explained.<BR><BR>However, Australia recently informed UNHCR that it refuses to accept the refugees, and that they, along with those on Nauru and Papua New Guinea, were told that their only option is to remain where they are or be transferred to Cambodia or the US.<BR><BR>This new information bars people from receiving the support of family residing in Australia - including for those who have undergone traumatic experiences, counting sexual violence, and those with serious medical conditions.<BR><BR>&quot;To avoid prolonging their ordeal, UNHCR has no other choice but to endorse the relocation of all refugees on Papua New Guinea and Nauru to the United States, even those with close family members in Australia,&quot; said Mr. Grandi.<BR><BR>&quot;There is no doubt these vulnerable people, already subject to four years of punishing conditions, should be reunited with their families in Australia. This is the humane and reasonable thing to do,&quot; he added.<BR><BR>The High Commissions reminded the Australian Government that its decision to deny these people the possibility is &quot;contrary to the fundamental principles of family unity and refugee protection, and to common decency.&quot;<BR><BR>Underscoring that UNHCR fully endorses the need to save lives at sea and provide alternatives to dangerous journeys and exploitation by smugglers, Mr. Grandi underscored that the practice of offshore processing has had a hugely detrimental impact.<BR><BR>&quot;There is a fundamental contradiction in saving people at sea, only to mistreat and neglect them on land,&quot; maintained the UN refugee agency chief.<BR><BR>&quot;Australia has a proud humanitarian tradition, manifested in its support for overseas aid and its longstanding refugee resettlement programme. I urge Australia to bring an immediate end to the harmful practice of offshore processing, offer solutions to its victims, for whom it retains full responsibility, and work with us on future alternatives that save lives at sea and provide protection to people in need,&quot; stressed Mr. Grandi.<BR><BR>He concluded by pointing out that at a time of record global levels of displacement, &quot;it is crucial that all States offer protection to survivors of war and persecution, and not outsource their responsibilities to others. Refugees, our fellow human beings, deserve as much.&quot;<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">-CITY, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON - Social support for young unaccompanied refugees will help positive integration, says study</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">946 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new study has shown that social support and opportunities to build family-like relationships and meaningful friendships could help unaccompanied and refugee youth to positively integrate upon their arrival in England.<BR><BR>The paper, which is from researchers at City, University of London, found that the refugees interviewed emphasised the importance of social support as a means for hope and escape from distress, as many felt isolated and lonely having arrived in England.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the participants' voices illustrate areas where gaps remain to be filled in terms of providing sufficient support to these most vulnerable groups, unaccompanied minors and refugee youth, in England. The authors highlight the need for care and support programmes that focus on providing opportunities for social relationships as well as initiatives that seek to prevent discrimination.<BR><BR>Despite the hardship experienced at an early stage of life by the participants, the findings also illustrate remarkable strength and the aspiration to move forward and achieve individual goals. In particular, participants expressed a desire to contribute to society, to complete an education and to establish a new family. The study is published in the Children and Youth Services Review.<BR><BR>The number of forcibly displaced individuals has increased in recent years, rising from 51.2 million in 2013 to 65.6 million in 2016 due to continuing conflicts, violence, persecution and human rights violations according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR).<BR><BR>The sharpest rise was seen between 2012 and 2015, due to conflicts in regions and countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Sub-Saharan Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Sudan and Burundi. In addition, other conflicts and insecurity worldwide continue to contribute to the number of individuals seeking safety. In the UK, the UNHCR estimated the number of refugees and asylum seekers in 2015 to be around 153,560.<BR><BR>In order to determine ways in which the positive post-migration development and integration could be achieved, the study conducted interviews with six asylum-seeking and refugee individuals from sub-Saharan Africa, who had arrived in England as unaccompanied minors and included five males and one female, aged between eighteen and 28 years. The interviews aimed to find out more about young asylum-seeking and refugee individuals' experiences of their social situation in England.<BR><BR>In particular they found that:  &lt;U&gt;naccompanied refugee minors can suffer distress pre-migration, during their journey and after arrival in asylum-countries;  &lt;B&gt;uilding new social relationships provides hope by reducing distress, social vulnerability and fear of rejection;  &lt;R&gt;elationships that resemble family bonds and friendship can provide opportunities for rebuilding trust, optimism and reducing despair;  &lt;U&gt;naccompanied refugee youth benefit from provision of meaningful activities which reduce feelings of discrimination; and  &lt;I&gt;nitiatives that seek to prevent discrimination, stigmatisation and isolation, and that aim to facilitate social relationships to develop, should be supported, for instance in professional care systems and school contexts. This includes the offer of therapeutic care, the need for stable adults, mentors for legal advice and guidance, community groups and also the opportunity for work and education.  Around these themes, participants highlighted the difficulties of arriving in England, with one discussing the issues of feeling labelled and stigmatised, saying how it 'doesn't matter how much you explain yourself, it will always be there. Like the Somali runner Mo Farah. You're different when you're a refugee. Even when you win a medal in the Olympics. They'll say he came when he was 2 or 3.'  Another participant also mentioned fears around discussing refugee status. 'I even feel scared when I go for a job interview and I take my refugee passport to present. And I'm just thinking; the manager will already put me in another group,' they said.  Participants also focused on education, highlighting that 'I want to be able to look after my family and look after myself and achieve my goals.'  In addition, the authors call for a change around negative discourse about 'refugees' and 'asylum-seekers' which is often dehumanising and generalising - and which does not consider the individual stories and backgrounds. The study also suggests that there may be implications for housing and living situations, as participants expressed distress about feeling isolated and lonely.  Speaking about the research, co-author Dr Sara Amalie O'Toole Thommessen, said:  'Based on the participants' expressed need for social support in our study it is evident that there is an important gap for asylum-countries to fill, particularly for young individuals who find themselves in a foreign country without their families.  'Unaccompanied refugee minors are particularly vulnerable to stress and risk pre-migration, during the journey to asylum-countries and in the asylum-country, and as a result, they can benefit from care and support programmes that focus on offering opportunities for social relationships to develop as soon after their arrival to the asylum-country as possible.  'Providing activities in which young refugees can engage and build meaningful relationships with peers, and trusting relationships with stable adults, seems important for the recovery of losses, reduction of distress, fear of rejection, as well as for facilitating well-being and positive development and integration.'

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners have lost a court battle to force Government to take the number of child refugees it promised to under the Dubs Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendment, passed in May 2016, required the Government to act &quot;as soon as possible&quot; to relocate and support unaccompanied refugee children in Europe. It was required to consult with local authorities to determine the number of children each council has the capacity to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees, the charity leading the case, accused the Home Office of adopting a &quot;seriously defective&quot; process to measure the capacity of local councils to take in child refugees, after it emerged many local authorities were not properly consulted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK refused entry to 130 child refugees due to administrative mistake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government announced in early February that it was to close the Dubs scheme after accepting just 350. It later admitted that an &quot;administrative error&quot; led to 130 places for child refugees offered by local councils not being taken into consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of Information requests submitted by </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">later showed that in total, councils had voluntarily offered to accept 1,572 more children than they were currently supporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, Help Refugees asked the court to order the Secretary of State to consult local authorities again, urging that the Government reopen the Dubs Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the closure of the scheme has been described as &quot;shocking&quot; and &quot;shameful&quot; by MPs and campaigners, the High Court judgement, delivered on the morning of Thursday 2 November, confirmed the Dubs Amendment will remain closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruling on the case on Thursday, the Divisional Court said there was nothing that could show that the consultation process or the consideration of the results was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not prepared to hold that arrangements have not been made as soon as possible for this is not something within the control of the UK Government,&quot; the judge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court accepted the Home Office's argument that &quot;the process of deciding who should be transferred was not one to which normal considerations of procedural fairness could realistically apply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the verdict, Josie Naughton, founder and CEO of Help Refugees said they were&quot;bitterly disappointed&quot; by this result, and said the charity intends to appeal the Court's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the time our litigation was issued, not a single child had been transferred to the UK under the Dubs Amendment. Transfers began under the pressure of this litigation and under the pressure from campaigners and parliamentarians,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've unearthed 130 extra places, which the government eventually admitted it had overlooked. These places for children are needed now more than ever. There are young unaccompanied children sleeping rough in Europe completely unprepared for the coming Winter. We intend to appeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Alf Dubs, who himself was a child refugee, told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; by the verdict, warning that the closure of Dubs will only lead to more children in precarious situations, with many falling prey to child traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We went into this with high hopes. Based on the evidence I'm really quire surprised. I've spoken to lots of local authorities who are willing to take in more child refugees,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm hoping the appeal will work. I've been in Calais and Greece recently and this only means more children will be living in the woods with their lives are on hold. More will turn to illegal routes and the traffickers will have field day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These youngsters don't escape that there's a pull factor, as argued by Theresa May. I don't think the people living in the horrors of Syria, and caught up in conflicts in countries like Ethiopia and Eritrea come here because of Dubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've met some of the children who have come across through Dubs and they're doing really well, one wants to do some work with me in Parliament, another one got top marks in school. I was given the warm welcome in Britain years ago and we should still be offering this to child refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">581 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia have announced that they plan to spend around 35 million euros (&pound;31 million) to beef up European Union borders as they come under pressure for refusing to accept refugee quotas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countries - known as the Visegrad Four - have been criticised for failing to show solidarity with Greece and Italy, where tens of thousands of migrants have landed after crossing the Mediterranean or Aegean Seas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of migrants and refugees was high on the agenda of a two-day EU summit in Brussels that started on Thursday - and some saw the border funding move by the four nations as a cynical ploy to avoid accepting refugee quotas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said their contribution will help save European funds and that &quot;if we will see good projects in the future, first of all projects that are effective, we are ready to spend even more money because we really want to show solidarity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary saw tens of thousands of Syrian refugees and other migrants travelled north on foot out of Greece through its territory in 2015, looking for shelter in richer northern European nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Viktor Orban ordered the construction of a border fence to keep the migrants out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Orban said that the border funds will help defend the EU's borders with the outside world and will also contribute to EU work in Libya, where many migrants leave for Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than one million refugees entered Europe in 2015, the EU introduced a refugee sharing plan to help out overwhelmed Greece and Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four Visegrad nations voted against quotas, but were legally bound to accept refugees as the decision was made by a majority vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Hungary and Poland have taken in no refugees under the plan, while the Czech Republic has accepted only 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the tensions, the EU Commission wants to introduce a permanent mechanism that would oblige countries to take quotas of refugees if one or more EU nations are hit by a migrant wave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Visegrad nations remain firmly against migrant quotas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quotas do not work, they are ineffective,&quot; Mr Fico said. &quot;The decision on quotas really divided the European Union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot have a system in which countries shop for those things they like from the European Union and are not willing to deliver the necessary solidarity,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It cannot be that Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany face all problems and that other nations say: That is so nice that they deal with it there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disagreement over the way to manage Europe's migrant challenge has created distrust between EU neighbours and fuelled anti-migrant parties across Europe, slowly undermining the entire European project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni said the pledge of more border funds from the Visegrad nations &quot;confirms the validity of the policies we are developing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, whose department drew up the quota plan and have defended it in court, welcomed the funding move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is proof that the Visegrad four countries are fully aligned when it comes to solidarity with Italy and with others, so for once I am a happy man,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French President Emmanuel Macron said it is important not to get bogged down in old disputes and that solidarity can take different forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to be able to express solidarity without getting trapped in any excessive road blocks&quot; about the past, he said. &quot;I think everyone needs to make an effort.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 17, 2017 &quot;Dad wants to know why I didn't stop you,&quot; my brother says, amused. Chatting to my parents on the phone earlier, I had casually dropped into the conversation that Youssef, an Eritrean refugee I had never met, was coming to stay in my spare room. They asked me what I knew about him. Not much: he's 27 and has been in the UK since last year, I'm the third family to host him, he likes football, he's Muslim. That's it. But how did I know I would be safe, they want to know. Now my brother is asking the same question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, it's a question a lot of friends have asked. A week earlier Refugees at Home, a charity that matches homeless refugees with volunteer hosts, sent a representative to my home to check me out and make sure my two-bedroom central London flat was suitable. He explained most people in Youssef's situation had faced unimaginable hardships to get here and were strongly motivated to do whatever it takes to make a good life for themselves and not jeopardise anything. Ultimately, he said, it's a leap of faith. You just have to trust him. I liked his candour.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 18 The idea of having a refugee to stay now seems perfectly sane to me. Refugees at Home was formed in October 2015 after a summer of heart-wrenching news stories about refugees being drowned in the Mediterranean or stifled in lorries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am moved by this, but this is not what inspires me. I have already worked with refugees in the US, where I lived until last year and where I volunteered to teach English to a family of Iraqi refugees. I also taught literacy to immigrant healthcare workers (mostly orderlies and cleaners), who would take a one-hour bus ride after exhausting eight-hour shifts to study with me and still find the energy to joke about my English accent. I would leave feeling happy that I had done something worthwhile. Honestly, that feeling is hard to beat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 19 I survey my flat before Youssef's arrival. I wonder what this young Muslim man will think of moving into a home with a 55-year-old godless, independent, wine-drinking Englishwoman. What will it be like sleeping with just a paper-thin wall between us and having use of a shared bathroom? I rearrange the furniture so that our beds are against opposite walls, as far as they can be from each other. I drink what's left of the wine and chuck out some dubious-looking half-empty bottles of spirits. I order fruit, vegetables and hummus on www.Tesco.com, and stuff the non-halal meat into the bottom of the freezer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 20 I have spoken to the lovely lady who is at present hosting Youssef. She tells me he is a delight, but very reserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you know about his life? How did he get here?&quot; I ask. She says she didn't like to ask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 21 Youssef arrives, carrying all his possessions in a very small bag. I spread out a map of the world on the dining table and point first to Eritrea and then to London. &quot;Please,&quot; I say, &quot;tell me your story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have done my homework. A United Nations report from 2016 concluded that Eritreans have been subjected to &quot;gross violations of human rights&quot; for 25 years. Many Eritreans are forced into indefinite military service and subjected to horrific abuses. This is why so many people like Youssef brave one of the world's most dangerous migrant routes, across the Sahara and the Mediterranean to Europe, to escape. Suddenly, this project takes a new dimension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In faltering English Youssef tells me about his journey, walking 550 miles from Eritrea to Khartoum and then to Egypt. Eleven terrifying days at sea, landing eventually in Italy. From there to Calais and then, finally to the UK, where he reported himself to the police on arrival. Despite all he has been through, he never criticises the Eritrean regime. He still has family there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over dinner we look at photographs of his six siblings on his phone and talk about his family. My sons are both abroad at college. I facetime them and introduce Youssef to them - at this point I am still nervous about having him in my house. I want him to realise that if anything happens to me, there will be people - two lovely young men like him - who would miss me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 23 I awake to news of a terror attack at an Ariana Grande concert and freeze when I hear the word &quot;Manchester&quot; (I had expected to hear some foreign place name). I explain to Youssef what has happened. He knows where Manchester is. It turns out that he has a pretty good knowledge of English geography based on a lifelong love of Premier League football. I worry about racist reprisal attacks and feel he should be prepared. &quot;Do you know what racism is?&quot; I ask stupidly. &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; he replies with feeling. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I say. &quot;How many dead?&quot; he asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 26 Five days in and we are getting used to each other. Youssef studies English at college two days a week. He hopes to get a job soon and, when his English is better, to study to become an electrician. I can't walk around naked any more and I no longer hang up my underwear to dry in the living room, but neither is really a hardship. He is slightly confused about whether to call me Alex or Alexa, since I address my Amazon Echo speaker as Alexa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 27 I'm off to the Hay-on-Wye literary festival for the weekend and put Youssef in charge of the cats. He seems delighted to have some small thing he can do for me. The cats can't believe their luck at having an additional human around. He has even won over the standoffish ginger tabby. Without being asked, Youssef carries my suitcase downstairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has become a pattern. He observes all the time, to find small acts of kindness he can perform. He empties the dishwasher and sweeps the floor unbidden and makes me cups of tea. He replaces the milk before we run out. Sensing that I am a bit of a neat freak, he keeps his room immaculately clean and tidy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 30 I return from Wales. The cats are totally under Youssef's spell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 3 Something is not right. I arrive home late in a cab after a night out. There are police everywhere. I put on flat shoes, grab a notebook and head out again. An officer turns me back at the end of my street. Another yells: &quot;Take cover, go back.&quot; &quot;I'm a reporter,&quot; I say, &quot;I need to get through.&quot; But they turn me back again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I watch news of the London Bridge terror attack on Twitter. I'm not entirely sober and realise there's not much I can do. I lie in bed listening to police helicopters circling all night and waiting for Youssef to come home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next morning he tells me he had been seeing friends and arrived back in the neighbourhood around midnight. By then our street, a stone's throw away from the attacks, was sealed off. He had no idea what was going on. The police made him wait three hours before letting him through the cordon to the flat. I tell him what happened. &quot;How many dead?&quot; he asks. I'm sick of having this conversation with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 7 &quot;You haven't thought this through, have you?&quot; I'm having lunch with my friend James and talking about the other big project in my life - my decision to start dating. &quot;How can you bring a man home with Youssef there?&quot; James wants to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's five years since my husband died, suddenly, of a heart attack, and I don't like being alone. I think I am ready now to start seeing someone. But James is right, I don't feel I could bring anyone home with Youssef there. I still have no idea what he thinks of the fact that I am out most nights with friends and family and often don't come home till late. Does he ever compare me with his own mother and wonder what kind of crazy world he has ended up in? June 8 At an election night party, my fellow diners tell me how &quot;brave&quot; I am. It's a common reaction. I tell them I got lucky with Youssef; he's quiet, considerate and respectful and helps around the house. He doesn't have a single annoying habit. He's figured out my routines and we've settled into a quiet companionship. There's often no need to talk. On evenings when we are both home, we sit in the living room, him doing his English homework, me watching Netflix - goodness knows what he makes of Lilyhammer or Backstrom, the rather offbeat series I've been watching (I've been careful not to watch anything with too much sex - that would feel weird).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 17 Youssef's arrival at my home followed a very dark time in my life. In February, on the fifth anniversary of my husband's death, I fell off an emotional cliff. It felt like I was going backwards. At the insistence of my sister, I agreed to see a therapist. Annette is wise and is wonderful at helping me to navigate my way back up to the surface. By the time Youssef arrives I am already much better. I tell her that having him in my home has contributed enormously to my recovery and she smiles knowingly. A couple of weeks ago she asked me: &quot;How do you want to use the rest of your life?&quot; It was an interesting way of looking at things and now I think I know part of the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 18 A friend from Pakistan tells me that with Youssef I am not just helping one person, I am helping a whole family, possibly a village. It's touching, but I suddenly feel an immense burden of responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 22 &quot;How are you going to transfer money to your family back home?&quot; I ask Youssef. &quot;Western Union?&quot; He smiles at me indulgently. I've learnt in the past month that he is both smart and funny and he tolerates my, at times, uninformed questions with good humour. There is no functioning Western Union in Eritrea, he says. He will have to rely on informal ways of sending money home through London's Eritrean community. &quot;But then you'd have to check it arrived there,&quot; I say. He looks at me kindly, as if I'm an idiot. &quot;Yes,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 2 I am returning from a weekend break, but my flight is delayed by the knock-on effects of an interfering drone at Gatwick. It's very late. A text from Youssef asks what time I will be home. It's the kind of thing my boys might do if I don't turn up when expected and it's a sign, I think, of how far we have come in a few short weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 3 My dilemma is what to do when my sons come home from college in mid-July. I tell Youssef he'll have to move out, but can come back in September. He is trying to find a room to rent, but first needs a job. When he arrived, the question of how long he would stay was left open. I realise now how much support he's going to need long-term and, having got to know him, I'm happy to help in whatever way I can because I've been a winner in this relationship too. It feels like the very least I can do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we're both in, he does his English homework while I watch Netflix</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 30 leading refugee and asylum seeker charities have called on the government to give local authorities more power over accommodation for those seeking sanctuary in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around &pound;4bn of government contracts to provide housing to asylum seekers from September 2019 was put out for tender in November. The closing date for bids is 17 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'Destitution is routine': refugees face homelessness even after gaining asylum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     In October, the Refugee Council said the current system - in which G4S and Serco manage the majority of asylum seeker housing - &quot;routinely dumped&quot; traumatised people into &quot;squalid, unsafe, slum housing conditions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an open letter to the home secretary, 33 organisations ask that local authorities be given the role of providing &quot;independent oversight&quot; of housing in their areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responsibility for housing people seeking asylum in the UK was taken away from local authorities in 2012 when contracts to provide the service were given to G4S, Serco and Clearsprings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At &pound;4bn of public money, it is one of the UK government's largest contracts,&quot; the letter reads. &quot;As agencies working to support refugee integration across the UK we are concerned that these public funds may once again go exclusively to private sector companies, with little or none of that money directed to support local government and the local communities where refugees are housed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A safe, secure home is a necessity for people seeking refugee protection in the UK. As most people arrive here exhausted and destitute it is right, and indeed a legal obligation, that the government provides housing to people in need as a public service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter's signatories - who include the CEOs of the British Refugee Council, the Scottish Refugee Council and Refugee Action - ask the home secretary to give councils a role overseeing how asylum housing is &quot;planned, procured, implemented and formally scrutinised in their areas&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Vermin, filth, threats: the scandal of Britain's housing for asylum seekers | Frances Ryan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter also calls for local authorities and communities to be &quot;fairly and fully financially resourced&quot; to ensure they can manage the costs of accommodating asylum seekers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     In January this year, the home affairs select committee produced a report which branded conditions  in asylum housing &quot;disgraceful&quot; after hearing evidence of widespread infestations of mice, rats and bedbugs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office response to the select committee report, issued in November, claimed it had implemented improvements that met many of the MPs' criticisms. In their letter, the charities said they were alarmed that the government had &quot;not engaged substantively with this report and the critical evidence made to it&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on Thursday at a Westminster hall debate on the Home Office response to the report, MP Yvette Cooper urged the government to recognise that some accommodation for asylum seekers was not fit for habitation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we don't recognise the problems that occurred as part of the last contract, how can we be sure that these issues will be recognised in the new contracts and the new system,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration minister Brandon Lewis, representing the government in the debate, said they were committed to ensuring destitute asylum seekers were accommodated in safe, secure and suitable accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He insisted the vast majority of the housing provided was a good standard. &quot;It is important to be aware that the contracts of provision of housing for asylum seekers do demand high standards,&quot; said Lewis. &quot;In many areas they are higher than that which we see in the social housing sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum seekers do not have permission to work while awaiting a decision on their claims. Under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 they are able to apply for accommodation and financial help from the Home Office if they have no other means of supporting themselves.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking over the shoulder of Gladys, a young South Sudanese refugee flicking through a frayed album of old family photos, my mind flashes back to my own younger self. At 18, I was in high school in California. I was responsible for my grades, for keeping my old Dodge running and helping clean the room I shared with my brothers. My great aspiration was to see Springsteen in concert one day. At 18, Gladys is a de facto mother to seven children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war in South Sudan has forced her into looking after a brood of younger siblings and cousins. Gladys's own proximity to childhood appears a forgotten fact in the family, most irreversibly by Gladys herself. It falls on her to make sure the children get to their studies, despite the four-hour round trip from the Imvepi refugee settlement to the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her days are consumed with fetching water from a well, collecting firewood, making meals, cleaning inside the wooden-poles-and-tarpaulin shelter that UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, provided for the young&nbsp; family when they first arrived in northern Uganda in 2016.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see families and homes that are no longer. Smiling faces from the past, a feast once laid out in a garden, a bygone birthday party, a graduation, picnics and weddings and children playing on porches. A photo of Gladys with her mother. Gladys's mother too is gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We sit perched on the side of a bed on which Gladys never sleeps. At night, she tucks in four of the younger children here, the other three on a mattress at the foot of the bed. Gladys sleeps on uncovered earth between bed and mattress, on the hard ground between brothers, sisters and cousins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gladys speaks with hushed poise as she turns over each album page. She tells me she was dragged from a bus that was set on fire, with women still screaming, still inside. She was forced to watch people she knew hacked to death before her, one by one. Gladys shrugs gently. She says she doesn't understand why she was allowed to live.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We get up to leave the shelter. Outside, when I kneel to put my shoes back on, she smiles. She had said when inviting me in that taking them off wasn't necessary, waving shyly at the modesty of her home. Inside, everything points to human life derailed, everything a simulacrum of normalcy: the precious photo album, a few schoolbooks, a well-thumbed Bible, a crocheted blanket, a teddy bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking around, I spot things I have come to know well from previous travels with UNHCR, the 'core relief items', kitchen set, jerrycans for water, a solar lamp under which the children do their homework at night, blankets, dry food rations, a hygiene kit of soap and sanitary pads. A starter pack for dignity. The basic blocks for rebuilding a life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shelter may be spare, but it is Gladys's home, the place where she and the children sleep, eat, laugh, tell stories and secrets, squabble and make up. It is under its roof that they feel rooted and safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside, I ask Gladys what her great aspiration is, remembering my own dreams of seeing The Boss live. Gladys says she hopes to find a job so that 'I can take care of my brothers and sisters and make sure they have a good education in the future'. She laughs timidly. 'My perfect job would be accounting.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Displaced children of South Sudan&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back on the bumpy road out of Imvepi, heading for Adjumani on the other side of the White Nile, I can only marvel. &nbsp;At Gladys and her resolve. At all the other Gladyses coming across the border daily. The more than 75,000 children who have fled - either unaccompanied or separated from their families - from South Sudan and the civil war that has raged there since the end of 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At every border point, reception centre, or refugee settlement I visit here in Uganda, I find areas specially designated for them, the unaccompanied and separated children, the most vulnerable of the vulnerable.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Sudan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hours and a battering rainstorm later, we sit on the ferry to Adjumani. Dusk is lovely on the White Nile,  the storm passed, the late sun dazzling in the water, the hump of a hippopotamus in the distance. But on the other side, the barbarity of the war in South Sudan rears its head once more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UNHCR convoy is waiting to cross, on its way to Palorinya settlement. &nbsp;Inside the buses sit hundreds of refugees who, mere hours before, had crossed the border into Uganda having fled a new outbreak of violence in the town of Pajok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I watch them leaving the buses, boys still in school uniforms, mothers, exhausted, bewildered men. They gather in shocked silence in a clearing by the ferry dock to wait for their crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Women's Executive Committee, refugees receive counselling and learn skillsCredit:      UNHCR/Jordi Matas     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the men tells me that soldiers opened fire on the streets of Pajok, in hospitals, in schools. People dropped everything and ran. Those who could not - the old, the infirm - were slaughtered. Families scattered into the bush, he says. His family spent three days without food, living on wild roots, hiding and walking to the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I look around me and see little in the way of belongings. Many here are barefoot. I pass a young mother breastfeeding, the infant only a week old. &nbsp; In the children spilling from these buses, I see the defining faces of the refugee crisis in South Sudan, Africa's largest and fastest growing. Over 1.9 million refugees have fled into neighbouring countries, nearly one million to Uganda.&nbsp;Most, 60 per cent, are children, frightened, confused, desperate for shelter and protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I watch my colleagues interacting with the newly arrived refugees from Pajok, asking them questions, reassuring them that once they reach the reception centre, staff will help them with food, protection, water, shelter and medical care.&nbsp; I admire the work being done here on the front line of the crisis, even though, astonishingly, depressingly, UNHCR's South Sudan emergency appeal is currently only 17 per cent funded. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see in these busloads of refugees the urgent need for critical funds. Not least because humanitarian organisations are supporting a refugee response model, here in Uganda, that is ambitious and visionary and should not be allowed to fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New kind of 'refugee' operation&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This trip to Uganda differs from visits I have made to refugee operations in other countries. The most glaring difference here is the absence of fenced-off refugee camps. Rather, in remarkable acts of generosity and solidarity, individual and community landowners, as well as the government, donate land to the refugees. At the banks of the White Nile, as I watch the tired refugees from Pajok, I feel a little hope knowing that within a few days they will be allocated a plot of land on which to build their emergency shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be free to start cultivating crops there, in order to become less reliant on aid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refugees in Uganda are allowed to move freely, to access the same healthcare and education systems as nationals, and to work and own businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda has its own painful history. It understands well that protracted war forces refugees to live in exile for years on average, often decades, and it has learnt that all parties are best served when refugees are incorporated into national development plans, instead of being viewed strictly through a humanitarian lens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's policy is not only progressive and compassionate, but also smart, as it helps better the lives of its own citizens. Take the case of Bidi Bidi, a small village in north Uganda that, in just nine months, has grown into one of the world's largest refugee settlements with over 272,000 inhabitants. Before the refugees arrived, there was no school here, no healthcare centre, no graded roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sit under a tree with a local Ugandan farmer named Yahaya. He tells me that previously his youngest children weren't receiving an education, as the nearest primary school was a prohibitively long walk away.&nbsp;It used to take days to get his crops to market and back, he says, but with the new roads it now takes him a few hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yahaya has donated land through the government scheme but also directly to refugees who have asked for extra land to cultivate.&nbsp; In this functional co-existence, made possible by Uganda's refugee policy, I see the power of pragmatic generosity. By the time we leave Bidi Bidi, I will have witnessed also the power of human generosity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aisha has big, kind eyes, a slender frame. She is 29, an abandoned wife, and mother to two boys, aged 13 and five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last August, she fled South Sudan with her sons, a young niece and nephew. &nbsp;She tells me about a checkpoint stop, a soft tremble of indignation creeping into her voice, at which she was forced to kneel, her younger son in her arms, the barrel of a gun pointed at her head. Death was a breath away. In the end, the soldiers took her money and belongings. Aisha and the children arrived in northern Uganda with next to nothing to call their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They received a UNHCR emergency shelter and Aisha quickly went about building a more permanent home from mud bricks she made herself, and thatching a roof from grass that she collected from the bush, one bushel a day. &nbsp;It was hard work, she says, but she saw to it that the children were sheltered, fed, clothed, enrolled in school.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Aisha agreed to become a foster parent, the children were excited to have a new sibling to play with. But when Aisha met the foster child, she found that she was paralysed on the right side of her body and doubly incontinent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She had been abandoned by her own mother. She needed uninterrupted care. Aisha spent a night in prayer. In the morning, she knew. 'I love her as my own now.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She considered three names for the child: Gloria, Mercy, and Grace. She decided on Mercy, Aisha says, her fleeting smile an &nbsp;acknowledgment of the poetry of her choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if given the choice, grateful as she is to Uganda, Aisha would prefer to go home. Gladys told me the same thing.&nbsp; So does David, a former director of education in South&nbsp; Sudan, who now teaches refugee and Ugandan children in Nyumanzi Integrated Primary School. We are standing outside an empty classroom during his break time, talking about the school, when he pauses, his eyes going liquid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;'Sometimes I wonder why God created me a refugee,' he says softly. 'How long must I be a refugee? When can I go home and help my&nbsp; own people?' Every refugee I have met - in Uganda, Chad, Jordan, Iraq, refugees from my own native Afghanistan - has echoed this wish.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking over the shoulder of Gladys, a young South Sudanese refugee flicking through a frayed album of old family photos, my mind flashes back to my own younger self. At 18, I was in high school in California. I was responsible for my grades, for keeping my old Dodge running and helping clean the room I shared with my brothers. My great aspiration was to see Springsteen in concert one day. At 18, Gladys is a de facto mother to seven children. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war in South Sudan has forced her into looking after a brood of younger siblings and cousins. Gladys's own proximity to childhood appears a forgotten fact in the family, most irreversibly by Gladys herself. It falls on her to make sure the children get to their studies, despite the four-hour round trip from the Imvepi refugee settlement to the school. Her days are consumed with fetching water from a well, collecting firewood, making meals, cleaning inside the wooden-poles-and-tarpaulin shelter that UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, provided for the young family when they first arrived in northern Uganda in 2016. Gladys flips the pages of the album. I see families and homes that are no longer. Smiling faces from the past, a feast once laid out in a garden, a bygone birthday party, a graduation, picnics and weddings and children playing on porches. A photo of Gladys with her mother. Gladys's mother too is gone. We sit perched on the side of a bed on which Gladys never sleeps. At night, she tucks in four of the younger children here, the other three on a mattress at the foot of the bed. Gladys sleeps on uncovered earth between bed and mattress, on the hard ground between brothers, sisters and cousins. Gladys speaks with hushed poise as she turns over each album page. She tells me she was dragged from a bus that was set on fire, with women still screaming, still inside. She was forced to watch people she knew hacked to death before her, one by one. Gladys shrugs gently. She says she doesn't understand why she was allowed to live. We get up to leave the shelter. Outside, when I kneel to put my shoes back on, she smiles. She had said when inviting me in that taking them of f wasn't necessary, waving shyly at the modesty of her home. Inside, everything points to human life derailed, everything a simulacrum of normalcy: the precious photo album, a few schoolbooks, a well-thumbed Bible, a crocheted blanket, a teddy bear. Looking around, I spot things I have come to know well from previous travels with UNHCR, the 'core relief items', kitchen set, jerrycans for water, a solar lamp under which the children do their homework at night, blankets, dry food rations, a hygiene kit of soap and sanitary pads. A starter pack for dignity. The basic blocks for rebuilding a life. The shelter may be spare, but it is Gladys's home, the place where she and the children sleep, eat, laugh, tell stories and secrets, squabble and make up. It is under its roof that they feel rooted and safe. Outside, I ask Gladys what her great aspiration is, remembering my own dreams of seeing The Boss live.

Two hours and a battering rainstorm later, we sit on the ferry to Adjumani.

But on the other side, the barbarity of the war in South Sudan rears its head once more. A UNHCR convoy is waiting to cross, on its way to Palorinya settlement. Inside the buses sit hundreds of refugees who, mere hours before, had crossed the border into Uganda having fled a new outbreak of violence in the town of Pajok.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">777 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by privately-owned Algerian newspaper El-Khabar website on 8 July</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of African and Syrian refugees and migrants mobilised the government in a meeting of Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune and his ministers on the day before yesterday, Thursday [6 July], to discuss their legal status particularly with the rise of racism against them in the last few days. Interior Minister Noureddine Bedoui submitted a comprehensive report on the state of the refugees and migrants in preparation for the enactment of a law that would provide them with the opportunity to work legally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has entered the stage of &quot;legalising&quot; the presence of African and some Syrian refugees in Algeria by beginning to prepare a law to serve that purpose. An informed source told El-Khabar that Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune convened the weekly meeting of the government to complete measures for the protection of African refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to our source, Noureddine Bedoui submitted a comprehensive report on the state of the refugees and migrants in Algeria which included their real numbers and the resources provided by the state to improve the conditions of their arrival. Bedoui also put before his colleagues in the government the broad lines of a draft law on the basis of which opportunities would be opened for the employment of refugees and migrants by granting them with a national identity card according to the requirements of various sectors, particularly public works, agriculture and maritime fishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the government received copies of the report with a view to adding to it in line with the contribution of each sector, particularly of the Justice, Solidarity, Labour, Public Works, Transport and Agriculture Ministries, while a special committee would work on preparing the draft law which would be ready for the beginning of the annual term of the two chambers of the parliament in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In tandem with the government's work, the police and gendarmerie services will carry out a full census of African refugees to identify every emigrant whose presence in Algeria was acceptable and would be provided with the opportunity to work. Regarding the others, an understanding would be reached with their countries with a view to repatriating them in the same way as an understanding was reached with Niger and Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has expedited its measure in order to close the refugees' and migrants' file after the escalation of horrific racism against them recently which was manifested in calls for their expulsion and the publication of regrettable images of attacks on some refugees on social network sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legalisation of the presence of refugees and migrants by granting them the opportunity to work legally came after warnings by human rights organisations in Algeria about the exploitation of illegal African migrants in Algeria under difficult conditions close to &quot;slavery&quot;. The organisations made demands to labour inspectorates across the provinces to intensify their patrols to prevent the exploitation of about 10,000 workers in various fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights previously raised the alarm regarding the exploitation of illegal African migrants by owners of businesses, contractors and owners of big farms and agricultural investments in their projects outside the pertinent laws including Law 11/90 concerning labour relations and specifically clauses 5 and 6 of the law on rights and duties and without declaring them to social security and without the knowledge of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and the Interior Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeals had been made to the competent authorities to carry out an in-depth investigation into the vile exploitation of African migrants on the grounds that the rights of workers were inseparable part of human rights which must not be breached under any pretext and those illegal African migrants were human beings first and foremost and that alone was enough for their rights to be protected particularly since they played roles which were beneficial to Algeria after African workers became the best alternative to building firms and contracts for irrigation, road and agricultural work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of refugees in Algeria who are under the care of the UN Higher Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] stood at 97,240 including 4,050 from Palestine, 50 from Cote d'Ivoire and 120 from other countries, and the number of Sahrawi refugees stood at 90,000. According to the UNHCR report, 120 people from Cameroon, 400 from Mali, 2,200 from Syria and 300 from other countries had applied for asylum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees drowned as smugglers push 160 off boat in suspected 'trend'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures show more than 2,300 refugees drowned in the Mediterranean last year, often setting out in makeshift or crowded vessels, in their bid to reach the shores of EU countries including Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial blow to Defend Europe's campaign comes just days after their C-Star ship went adrift in the Mediterranean when its engine shut down, forcing nearby vessels to answer a distress call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group had been raising money on the Patreon online payment website through an account named &quot;European Identity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian right-wing commentator Lauren Southern set up the profile page which raised the funds for Defend Europe to set sail last month in their mission to stop refugee boats from leaving the coast of Libya.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activist and self-styled independent journalist had promoted the organisation's Generation Identity fundraising campaign mission through a YouTube video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement by Patreon to Ms Southern read: &quot;It appears that you are currently raising funds in order to take part in activities that are likely to cause loss of life. We have therefore decided to remove your page from Patreon, and paid out your final balance of $95.00 to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added: &quot;We understand that this will come as a disappointment. Please know that we have come to this decision after a long review process and will not consider an appeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives at the crowd-funding platform investigatedMs Southern's profile after a lobbying campaign by groups including Hope for Hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Southern claimed money she had raised through Patreon was related to her independent journalism work and no funds were diverted to the Defend Europe cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patreon executives did not immediately reply to a query when contacted to comment further over its decision to shut down the activist's profile page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate crowdfunding webpage for Defend Europe on the platform WeSearchr remains active and has raised more than $200,000 through donations from some 3,000 contributors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right-wing group states on its profile page: &quot;It's a mission to save Europe, to stop illegal immigration, and end the dying on the sea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owners of the California-based website WeSearchr did not immediately reply to a request asking if they would review Defend Europe'saccount amid claims their mission could cost lives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have duty to help disabled refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was recently revealed that just five per cent of refugees resettled from Syria under the Government's Vulnerable Person relocation programme (VPRP) have disabilities, including mobility issues or special education needs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is despite the fact that Britain's pledge to resettle refugees made specific reference to support disabled Syrians and that the VPRP, which commits the Government to take in 20,000 refugees by 2020, was set up to accommodate the most at risk groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is appalling and a new low in this Government's treatment of refugees. Mrs May said a year ago that a disability or health condition should never dictate the path anyone could take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Government must be made to understand that they should stop passing off refugees as someone else's problem. They will go down as the ones that watched while thousands suffered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all must also demand that the Government stops playing into a toxic narrative that claims showing compassion for people who are victims of poverty and war is wrong because they are after welfare and wish to do us harm. Whether it was the Vietnamese in the 1970s, or the Ugandans in the 1980s or the Kosovans in the 1990s, we have a proud history of giving sanctuary to those escaping war and persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We demean this legacy by turning our backs on desperate refugees, wishing to escape and build lives here. Europe is facing the biggest refugees crisis since the Second World War. It is a test of our humanity and principles, and test of our international cooperation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rec' is our war memorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am sure I am not on my own in hoping that Ribble Valley Borough Council will dismiss the current ill-considered planning application for an extension of Berry Lane Medical Centre, which encroaches onto Longridge's First World War Memorial Field. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This field is held in perpetuity by us, the people of Longridge, for the people of Longridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Longridge's councillors should be applauded for recommending refusal of the application, my only surprise was that this was not unanimous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the benefit of newcomers, the rec' has been Longridge's War Memorial for 90 years and, in that time, has been held as sacrosanct with efforts to build on it fiercely resisted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a decision for the people of Longridge only, not those of the surrounding villages' as some suggest in support of the application, as I am sure they would take a dim view of us interfering with their war memorials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plans indicate a relatively small amount of encroachment, but nevertheless this would set an unwelcome precedent and the plans also show a markedly reduced parking area for staff. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, with a projected large increase in staff and patients, would lead to an already inadequate parking provision becoming intolerable and an even greater problem of on-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">street parking in central Longridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However you look at it, interference with war memorials is termed desecration'. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sure the irony as we commemorate the centenary of the Great War and the battles of Third Ypres/Passchendaele, where some of the 100 or so men of Longridge were literally lost', should not be lost on planners and doctors alike.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, August 6, I developed a flat tyre on the M6. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I came off the motorway at the Tickled Trout and pulled up into the bus lay-by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young gentleman, who turned out to be called Jamie, drew up behind me and offered to change the tyre. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, as with many new cars, there was no spare tyre provided. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was 3.30pm and raining. He offered to go and find someone and returned 15 minutes later with another gentleman (Mel, I think) and the two of them sorted me out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am 78, had two more elderly friends with me, and Jamie's actions restored my faith in human nature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too often, people of my generation criticise the younger people, sometimes rightly so, but I am so grateful to Jamie for his help and kindness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mel too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie was dressed in a red T-shirt and denims, was quite tall with dark hair, had been in the Army and lived in the New Hall Lane area. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have, for the past 30 years, walked the full length of Hoyles Lane, Cottam, and I have never seen it flood like it does now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The road gets flooded and gardens are flooded. They never used to flood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless I am mistaken, water travels downhill. Why then are the developers permitted to build houses higher than the  well-established properties? This will inevitably cause flooding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The developers are putting all these new houses up with inadequate drainage facilities being put in place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my view, if this keeps happening, which it undoubtedly will, it is only a matter of time before it will become a major issue. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is charity status for public schools, which means they have 80 per cent tax relief on business rates. State schools pay the full business rate. Now we learn many private hospitals enjoy a &pound;5m tax break over the next five years. It is no secret that the NHS is in a parlous state financially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally the Conservative party has ensured nothing but the best' for their own. The great Victorian Tory statesman Benjamin Disraeli stated that &quot;a Conservative government is an organised hypocrisy&quot;. The Labour Government was no different. When in a position to do something, it did nothing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">November 24, 2017<BR><BR>Stating that the beating of refugees and asylum-seekers at the former regional processing centre on Manus Island by uniformed officers is both &quot;shocking and inexcusable,&quot; the United Nations refugee agency has urged the Australian Government to take immediate action to ensure their safety and protection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation still unfolding on Manus Island presents a grave risk of further deterioration, and of further damage to extremely vulnerable human beings,&quot; said Thomas Albrecht, the Regional Representative for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the Australian capital, Canberra, in a news release.<BR><BR>&quot;[We] renew [our] call for all Australian parliamentarians and leaders to take immediate action to provide protection and safety for all refugees and asylum-seekers transferred to Papua New Guinea,&quot; he added.<BR><BR>According to the news release, the beatings - including with metal poles - has been seen on footage released today. UNHCR staff have also received reports that several men remaining inside the regional processing centre have been seriously injured.<BR><BR>Limited access, however, has hampered the UN agency's officials from gaining a better picture on the ground and the agency is seeking additional information from the Governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea.<BR><BR>&quot;Medical treatment for all refugees and asylum-seekers who require it is of paramount importance,&quot; said UNHCR in the release.<BR><BR>The UN agency further added that it had &quot;unequivocally&quot; advised Australia and Papua New Guinea prior to closure of the regional processing centre that comprehensive, intensive support for refugees and asylum-seekers is critical.<BR><BR>&quot;Despite this, medical care remains inadequate, and caseworkers, interpreters, and torture and trauma counselling are completely unavailable,&quot; it said, adding that similar concerns have also been raised by the authorities in Papua New Guinea, who lack the means and infrastructure to provide such services without further resources. Recognized refugees still being offered 'enticements' to 'voluntarily' return - UNHCR<BR><BR>Also in the release, UNHCR voiced particular concern that recognized refugees are still being offered enticements to &quot;voluntarily return&quot; to their home countries.<BR><BR>According to the news release, these places include countries where human rights conditions have significantly deteriorated in the past 12 months.<BR><BR>&quot;Severely inadequate services and conditions may now further coerce refugees with a well-founded fear of persecution to nevertheless return to their countries of origin,&quot; said the UN agency.<BR><BR>It added that it is aware, for example, of a refugee who recently returned to his home country, despite the precarious situation there, given fears for his safety and health in Papua New Guinea.<BR><BR>&quot;Having been attacked by machete, and unable to get required medical treatment for a serious existing medical condition that had then been exacerbated, he felt he had no choice but to go back,&quot; it noted.<BR><BR>According to the UNHCR, Manus Island (located some 320 kilometres or 200 miles off the northern coast of Papua New Guinea) has been the focus of Australia's off-shore processing policy. Of the approximately 3,000 refugees and asylum-seekers forcibly transferred by Australia to facilities in Nauru and Manus, some 1,200 remain in Nauru and 900 in Papua New Guinea.       </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TEAM of five Ilkley and Burley-in-Wharfedale residents who have joined forces to arrange day trips in the area for refugee and asylum seeking families living in Bradford are gearing up to host their next event in Ilkley later this month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working together with the support group, Refugee Action, this will be the sixth event that the group has organised this year alone. The trips have involved a day at Ben Rhydding Scout Hut with art and craft activities and outdoor games in September, a day of outdoor fun at Nell Bank in August and a treasure hunt and visit to see the bluebells in Middleton Woods in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group consisting of Felicity Tomblin, Rosalind Beeson, Sarah O'Mahony, Sue Staton and Sarah Bruce, which also incorporates the Wharfedale Refugee Response action group, set about organising the trips with their friends and generous volunteers to provide an opportunity for refugee families to have much needed breaks, make new friends, experience new parts of the country and to feel a sense of welcome from local people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money was raised initially to fund one trip in 2016, but thanks to the generosity of the local community, funds raised have far exceeded expectation and to date, ten trips and events have been organised since last year, with over 250 refugee parents and children enjoying the beauty and friendship of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as their volunteers, the group has involved schools, churches, small companies and large organisations. Primary schools have raised money and invited Refugee Action into school to talk about what it's like to be a refugee in the UK, churches have offered venues, funds, warmth and hospitality and the train company Northern has paid for all train fares for the families from Bradford. In addition, Tesco's in Ilkley has donated food and other resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only do the trips provide a break and breathing room for refugee families under stress, they have provided a great opportunity for local residents and refugees to come together to share stories, experiences and fun. The group has welcomed families from all over the world, including Sudan, Iraq, Sri Lanka, El Salvador, Congo, Burma, Pakistan, Nigeria, Morocco, Somalia, Libya, Syria and Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christy Bischoff from Refugee Action said: &quot;Going through the asylum system is a very stressful time. People who have fled their own countries looking for safety then have to go through the asylum process in this country, which may take months or years. People often comment about feeling very isolated and alone as they never get the opportunity to experience anything outside Bradford or meet new people. These trips give them breathing space, a chance to make good friends, experience the beauty of the countryside, but above all to feel welcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip in October will be held at the Quaker Meeting House in Ilkley and will involve making mobile sculptures with local artists, Juliet and Jamie Gutch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the success of the trips and the friendships that have been made, the team has vowed to continue their activities into 2018 and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more details of the group's activities as well as other initiatives including the popular &quot;Advent Appeal&quot;, follow the Wharfedale Refugee Response Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/wharfedalerefugeeresponse/.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">829 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historians from the University of East Anglia (UEA) will meet with MPs to discuss parallels between Britain's responses to the plight of refugees in the 1930s and today, and look for policy solutions.<BR><BR>The UEA academics and partners from humanitarian organisations will present the findings to the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Archives and History on Thursday. Panellists include Dr Becky Taylor of UEA's School of History; Labour Peer Lord Alf Dubs, who came to Britain as a child refugee; Dima Mekdad, co-founder of the Qisetna: Talking Syria project; and Lisa Matthews of Right to Remain, which supports people in the asylum and immigration systems. The panel is chaired by Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour MP for Torfaen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">UEA's Refugee History project has drawn from material held in the National Archives at Kew to create an occasional paper, 'Refugee History: the 1930s crisis and today', which will be presented to the APPG. Written by Dr Taylor, a reader in modern history, and Dr Kate Ferguson, an honorary research fellow in UEA's School of History, the paper provides four case studies that draw analogies between the plight of vulnerable people fleeing discrimination, violence, and insecurity in the 1930s and today.<BR><BR>The paper is published with the support of the charity Protection Approaches, which defends the rights of all peoples who are violently targeted because of their identity, whether in the UK or abroad. The research is also supported by the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism at Birkbeck, University of London.<BR><BR>The APPG will also discuss Britain's responses to and responsibilities towards the global challenges of forced human displacement. The group will consider:<BR><BR>Who is responsible for refugees after they have left their country of origin?<BR><BR>Does Europe, or Britain, have any responsibility for people fleeing violence, environmental collapse and economic chaos in the Middle East or Africa?<BR><BR>The UN's refugee agency UNHCR reported in 2016 that the number of displaced people, at 65.3 million, was the highest ever recorded. At one out of every 113 people in the world, it surpassed even post-World War II numbers.<BR><BR>The UK will redefine its policy towards mass displacement as it prepares to withdraw from the European Union. The Refugee History paper states:  &lt;W&gt;e believe Britain has the opportunity to take an international lead in promoting a burden-sharing solution to the current global refugee situation whether at home, with partners in the EU, or through throwing the full weight of its influence behind the UNHCR.  &lt;W&gt;e remind the UK Government and its EU partners that how they respond to the plight of vulnerable people reaching Europe's shores will be recorded in domestic and international refugee and human rights history.  &lt;W&gt;e urge the UK government to use an evidence-based approach - including historical evidence - to inform future policy regarding reception and resettlement of asylum seekers and refugees.  Dr Taylor said: 'Britain's political and social engagement with issues of migration and refugees is approaching a critical juncture, as it seeks to redefine itself outside of the European Union.  'Our work suggests that lessons learnt and global commitments made after the Second World War and in the wake of the Holocaust are being forgotten. But we also argue that the United Kingdom has an opportunity, as it did in the 1930s, to show political leadership at home and on the international stage.  'History can helpfully offer up examples for consideration, allowing us to look differently at present events, and point to potential policy solutions.'  The APPG meeting provides the opportunity for 'an evidence-based conversation that draws on historical expertise, research and experience to enhance current efforts to address today's global challenges,' she said.  Dr Ferguson, who is also director of research &amp; policy at Protection Approaches, said: 'If 'Brexit Britain' really is to become a more 'global Britain', could this translate into the UK taking a strong leadership role in one of the world's most pressing and seemingly intractable problems?  'The need for global leadership toward the protection of civilians from mass atrocities is urgent. The evidence-based research from the Refugee History project and our partners throws up stark warnings from history but also offers a way forward.'  Nick Thomas-Symonds said: 'We have a proud history in the UK of being a safe haven for refugees. This is evidence of the generosity of spirit of so many people over many generations. As we consider the many displaced people in our modern world, we can find lessons and warnings in world history. I am grateful to those who have contributed their perspectives to today's event held by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Archives and History as we seek to tackle this great humanitarian challenge with compassion.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family reunions for lone children with family in Britain should be accelerated, they said, adding that youngsters who are currently waiting many months to access this legal route are often falling into the hands of smugglers and traffickers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners lose court battle against Government over Dubs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK refused entry to 130 child refugees due to administrative mistake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The renewed appeal comes after the first unaccompanied child stranded in Greece arrived in the UK -a year and a half after the Home Office pledged to bring hundreds to safety. The Home Office had accepted that the boy was vulnerable and eligible for transfer 16 months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the demolition of the Calais &quot;Jungle&quot; in October 2016, the UK gave sanctuary to 200 children under the Dubs provision. But since then, no children have been transferred from the north of France under the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is despite the fact that there are an estimated 100 lone minors currently sleeping rough in Calais. Volunteers working on the ground say one of them, an unaccompanied Afghan boy, is just 10-years-old, and is currently sleeping between two trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an onslaught of freezing temperatures last week and pressure from charities, the authorities in Calais opened sheltered accommodation in a warehouse with capacity for a total of 270 people. But with between 600 and 700 refugees in the area, many are still having to sleep outside in the rain and snow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in Calais have been enduring freezing temperatures, some suffering hyperthermia(Futuro Berg/Help Refugees)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annie Gavrilescu, who is working on the ground in Calais with charity Help Refugees, which also signed the letter to Ms Rudd, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;It's really, really freezing. There's a lot of snow and rain. It's not the nice kind of snow; it's bitter cold and miserable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't sleep very much in the night. It's impossible -it's too cold and wet. And then they've also got police often coming and removing any makeshift shelters they've made. We're seeing signs of hyperthermia -people are very pale, sometimes they have slurred speech and get very faint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can definitely sense how the mood has gone down even further. It's just really desperate and despondent. We've always said we want the places filled by the time this big freeze comes. It's now here, and kids as young as 10 are having to sleep outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter says: &quot;In light of the current detrimental situation in Calais, a continued commitment by our Government to its legal obligation to fulfil the Dubs Amendment appears to be more important than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The previous transfer of 200 children in 2016 proves that our Home Office and our Government are able and willing to follow a proud tradition of being a safe haven for child refugees. Knowing that at least four children lost their lives last year at our border in Calais before the Amendment was implemented is heartbreaking, and we cannot let this happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are writing to ask that you ensure further safe transfers to the UK as swiftly as possible to fill the 480 capacity, and to urge the Government to provide swift access to family reunion so that children do not have to risk their lives to reach protection and their families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter also urges that the EU-Turkey deal eligibility deadline of 20 March 2016 be reconsidered, as currently only children who arrived in Europe before this date are considered eligible under Dubs -meaning many who arrived more recently are not being considered for the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Involvement in anti-exploitation and anti-trafficking efforts in northern France must also be renewed and reinforced, the signatories state, claiming the UK has a duty to safeguard refugees from the dangers posed by exploitative criminal networks before they reach Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent research by Refugee Rights Data Project indicates that the majority of child refugees in Calais are facing sustained and increasingly brutal forms of police violence as well as abuse by civilians, with many also suffering from untreated mental and physical health problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revealed earlier this year that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refugees in the region had been subject to aggressive use of tear gas and repeated destruction of possessions at the hands of local police, whose conduct was recently condemned by the French government following an independent inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing desperation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of displaced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">children, many of whom have family members in the UK, has made them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     increasingly prone to exploitation at the hands of smugglers and traffickers, who are said to promise them a free crossing in return for &quot;work&quot; upon arrival in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of refugees become targets for smugglers in northern France</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the letter, a Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;We remain committed to transferring 480 children from Europe to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have accepted further referrals this year and transfers are ongoing. We will continue to work closely with EU partners and local authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In addition, our wider focus remains helping those in need of international protection in the region, which is why we have committed to resettle up to 23,000 refugees from the region - more than 9,000 are already rebuilding their lives in the UK - and the Government has pledged &pound;2.46bn to the humanitarian response to the Syria conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 600 asylum seekers and refugees are refusing to leave the Manus Island immigration detention centre, which is due to close next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities will cut off access to drinking water, food, medical treatment, electricity and sewerage from next Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees will be forced to move to alternative accommodation centres nearer Manus's main city of Lorengau. Services will be provided to refugees while they wait for resettlement elsewhere in Papua New Guinea or in a third country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also 156 people on Manus whose bid for asylum has been rejected. They will be moved to a third accommodation centre, but are being encouraged to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia must act to stop 'humanitarian emergency' in Manus, says UNHCR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate estimates heard on Monday that 606 people who were required to leave by the closure deadline were refusing to move out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if they would be removed by force, the immigration department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, said that was a matter for the Papua New Guinean government. Pezzullo suggested the ordinary laws of trespass might apply because PNG was planning to reoccupy the former military facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't have a human right to trespass on a naval base,&quot; he told senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingyan refugee Imran Mohammad Fazal Hoque told the Guardian men were fearful of being abandoned in the Manus community, where low-level wariness has escalated in recent months to outright hostility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have experienced riot, been shot at, assaulted, treated sometimes worse than animals, robbed and on many occasions beaten in front of the Australian security guards,&quot; Hoque said. &quot;We call for help in the vain hope that someone might answer. The fear that has grown in the inmates' minds will never go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pezzullo rejected claims people were too scared to leave the centre, saying refugees could now come and go at will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG's security forces have a troubled history at the detention centre. In 2014, police officers were part of a mob that stormed the centre and attacked those inside during three days of rioting in which one asylum seeker was murdered and more than 70 seriously injured, including being shot, having their throats cut and beaten with wooden staves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April this year, &quot;drunken soldiers&quot;, according to the police, shot at refugees and tried to ram a vehicle through the centre's gates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Peter Dutton launches extraordinary attack on 'economic refugees' sent to US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre is closing because the PNG supreme court ruled in April 2016 that the detention of refugees and asylum seekers was &quot;illegal and unconstitutional&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, the Australian government settled a court action to pay $70m in damages for holding men unlawfully, in dangerous and damaging conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia retains effective control of the processing centre. All Australian government staff will leave the centre at the closure date, but the government will continue to have oversight. The government is in negotiation with a number of service providers to continue to support those held on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia will spend between $150m and $250m supporting refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island in the year after the regional processing centre closes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost all the men held on Manus have been there more than four years. More than 71% have been found to be refugees - they have a &quot;well-founded fear of persecution in their home country&quot;, they cannot be returned home and are legally owed protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has offered refugees on Manus the chance to move to Nauru while they await possible resettlement in the US. Two refugees have expressed an interest in going.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1044 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By BBC Monitoring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh is facing challenges on several fronts amid worsening Rohingya refugee crisis, as thousands of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state, crossed the border into the neighbouring country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 370,000 Rohingya have entered Bangladesh since last month as Myanmar's security forces began a crackdown in response to the Rohingya insurgents' attacks on police posts and an army base on 25 August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN human rights chief Zeid Raad al-Hussein, on 11 September, said the Myanmarese military's operation appeared to be &quot;a textbook example of ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar's military, however says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies it is targeting civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya, a stateless mostly Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Rakhine, have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, which says they are illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to deal with the Rohingya crisis, the Bangladesh government is working on three things to tackle the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Seeking global pressure on Myanmar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dhaka has been soliciting &quot;political support&quot; from the international community to put pressure on Myanmar to take back the Rohingya refugees who have taken shelter in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahead of the UN General Assembly session next week when the issue is expected to be debated, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina sought global intervention over the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During her visit to a refugee camp on 12 September, she drew attention to the suffering of innocent people and urged Myanmar to view the situation with humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also urged the leaders of the Islamic countries and organizations to forge unity to protect the Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali also briefed Dhaka-based diplomats from Afghanistan, Brunei Darussalam, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, India, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Maldives about the ongoing situation and the humanitarian crisis being faced by the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media echoed the sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An editorial in second-largest Bengali-language daily Kaler Kantho on 11 September said that there was &quot;no substitute for diplomatic attempt to solve the Rohingya crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalist Niaz Alam in a commentary in popular daily Dhaka Tribune writes: &quot;Now is the time for Bangladesh to take centre stage to make the case for solidarity...The world is in need of a new Statue of Liberty. Bangladesh should take the lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An editorial in New Age on 12 September concurred, saying &quot;it is important that Bangladesh make the world powers realise that the crisis, if remains unresolved for uncertain period, might destabilise the entire region&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Tackling the humanitarian crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest challenge for Bangladesh government right now is the massive humanitarian crisis as thousands of Rohingya refugees continue to pour into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh is already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who have fled previous outbreaks of violence in Myanmar. Its two official refugee camps are full and aid agencies say the new arrivals desperately need food, shelter and medical help, reports English-language newspaper The Daily Observer on 11 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions in the makeshift camps are quite appalling as there are no latrines and arrangements for safe drinking water. So, diarrhoea and cold epidemics seem to be looming large, the aid agencies add.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), many children of survivors suffer from mental and physical trauma due to the violence against their family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bangladeshi prime minister, during her visit to the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in the southeastern part of the country, assured the refugees of continued humanitarian assistance and food and medical treatment until Myanmar took them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on 10 September, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said the government will rehabilitate Rohingyas over a 2,000 acre land and assured of allotting more land if necessary, The Daily Observer reported on 11 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalist Gazi Nasiruddin Khokon, said in a show on ATN News on 10 September said that &quot;Bangladesh is doing all it can to deal with the situation by allowing refugees to enter on humanitarian ground&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added that the situation was &quot;very complex compared to any other prevailing refugee crisis in the world since Bangladesh is a very poor country. So it is very difficult for Bangladesh to deal with this crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another editorial in Bengali daily Jugantor on 11 September concurred, saying &quot;it is not easy ensuring shelter and food security for this huge number of Rohingyas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding that the country has been &quot;facing a very hard time while dealing with the situation&quot; the paper hoped that the international community would &quot;stand beside Bangladesh to bring a solution to this crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Registration amid fears of enrolling Rohingyas as voters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bangladesh government has started recording biometric data of Rohingyas as part of efforts to document the refugees entering the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the fingerprint, important information of each refugee will be stored in a dedicated server including name, gender, age, photo, parents' name, birthplace, nationality, country and religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's Election Commission has also instructed its field-level officials to take legal action against those who will attempt to enrol Rohingyas in the fresh voter list ahead of the next general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes amid allegations that the Rohingya refugees were collecting fake birth certificates and national ID cards from local public representatives to be registered as voters, the EC's acting secretary Helaluddin Ahmed told The Daily Star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intelligence agencies were also keeping a watch on the Rohingyas to ensure they did not get involved in any criminal activities or were used by people with vested interest, The Independent newspaper said on 10 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voicing similar concern, Dr. Golam Rahman, Chief Information Commissioner in a talk show on Bengali television channel ATN News on 9 September, felt that Rohingya refugees &quot;also have some responsibilities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have seen many Rohingyas who entered Bangladesh earlier, made fake passports and committed crimes. They should avoid such activities this time,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees on Manus Island have been warned that their chance for resettlement in the United States will be jeopardised if they resist moves to force them to a new transit centre near the township of Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of refugees are refusing to leave the Manus detention centre - which is isolated and on the grounds of a military base - saying they do not feel safe in the township and fear being attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest of a series of assaults on refugees and asylum seekers, a Bangladeshi man was allegedly attacked with a machete in Lorengau last month, and his arm hacked so severely he needed to be evacuated to Port Moresby for emergency medical treatment. Advocates say he was robbed of his phone, money and belongings, the fourth violent robbery of a refugee or asylum seeker in the past month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island refugee 'needs medical treatment in Australia' after alleged knife attack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Good Friday, the detention centre itself was attacked and refugees and staff shot at by rampaging armed police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the closure of the Manus detention centre - ruled illegal and unconstitutional 15 months ago by the Papua New Guinea supreme court - continues: the gym has been closed, generators removed, the canteen destocked and English classes and other activities have been discontinued, while buildings are being progressively shut down and cordoned off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have been told if they don't agree to move to the Australian government-built East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre (ELRTC) on the outskirts of Manus province's main town, their reluctance may be used against them in deciding whether they can resettle in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A document posted at the detention centre and headed &quot;Manus Island closes in 123 days&quot;, reads: &quot;The Manus RPC will close on 31 October 2017. Refugees should move to the ELRTC without delay. Accommodation at the ELRTC is safe and secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you refuse to move to the ELRTC or ignore other directions given to you, your failure to cooperate will be noted. US authorities will take your history of behaviour into account when deciding whether to offer you an opportunity to resettle in the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are expected to cooperate with the closure of the Manus RPC. Illegal behaviour will be reported to the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees held on Manus say the centre is being closed around them as another measure to push them out of the centre and to accept resettlement in PNG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the proposed US resettlement deal was announced last September, interviews with US government agencies have been undertaken, but no one has been resettled from either of Australia's two offshore islands, Manus or Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the US president, Donald Trump, succeeded in having large parts of his proposed travel ban upheld by the supreme court. The ban suspends all refugees without a family connection to America from entering the US for 120 days while vetting proceedings are strengthened. The ban also suspends Iranian nationals, the largest national cohort on Manus and Nauru, from entering the US for 90 days if they don't have links already in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One refugee, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardising his future resettlement prospects, said those held on Manus had lost faith in the US deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't believe them when they talk about the American deal. They just say that to make people cooperate. They have lied to us over and over again, and this is just another lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition, Ian Rintoul, said few refugees were voluntarily moving to East Lorengau as they faced danger there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has no concern for the welfare of the detainees. The attempt to drive them out of the detention centre is being driven by the fact that the contract for running the detention centre ends in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The punitive attempt to force them into East Lorengau is also an admission that there is no safe resettlement in PNG.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australian government pays heavy penalty for Manus mistreatment | Richard Ackland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG's immigration authority did not return repeated calls from Guardian Australia for information about the closure of Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Manus moves towards its enforced closure (the private service providers have refused to bid for further contracts to run the camp) another United Nations body has condemned Australia's offshore detention regime, calling for it to be immediately ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights committee, part of the office of the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, issued a statement last week regarding Australia's offshore islands, saying it was &quot;alarmed by the punitive approach taken by [Australia] in recent years toward asylum seekers arriving by boat without a valid visa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The committee also remains concerned at the state party's policy of transferring asylum seekers to the regional processing centres for the processing of their claims, despite public reports on the harsh conditions prevailing in those centres, including for children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Brutal truth of Australia's detention regime can't be written off. Not even for $70m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This includes acute isolation, overcrowding, limited access to basic services, including healthcare and education, allegations of sexual abuse by personnel of the service providers, acts of intimidation, taunting and provocation against asylum seekers, as well as reports of repeated incidence of suicide and self-harm among asylum seekers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee called on Australia to end its offshore detention policy, close the camps, and bring asylum seekers and refugees to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the Australian government settled a class action brought by 700 Manus detainees alleging wrongful imprisonment, and agreed to pay $70m in compensation for their unlawful detention as well as physical and psychological damage. In settling, the government did not admit any liability. </SPAN></P>

The group who play here are young refugees and asylum seekers. Coming from war-torn countries and separated from their families, most have been traumatised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Refugee Cricket Project, organised by the Refugee Council, involves weekly cricketing sessions that are not just a chance to play and connect with friends, but also an opportunity for to access advice and support as they navigate the complex asylum system and other challenges in their new home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIRAL; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1111 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are currently more displaced people around the world than at any other time on record - over 65 million people, according to the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while plenty of African and Asian countries are doing as much as they can to host the world's 22.5 million refugees, the overall response in the West seems to be one of suspicion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nations have, historically, been wary of welcoming refugees into their countries. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the leader of the United States calling for a complete ban on refugees, perceptions have to be changed in order for vulnerable people to reach safety. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's where Syrian-born artist Mohamed Hafez and Iraqi-born writer Ahmed Badr come in. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How suitcases and model homes are helping tell the stories of refugees from around the world Code 1                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed and Ahmed have been telling the stories of refugees from around the world - Afghanistan, Congo, Syria, Iraq and Sudan - who have fled war zones and built new lives in America. But they've been doing it in a very innovative way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big misconception is that refugees and migrants all come from impoverished backgrounds,&quot; Mohamed, an architect who moved to the US on a student visa, said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project he's undertaken with Ahmed, called Unpacked, shows exactly what some refugees are leaving behind when they flee their homes, by remodelling parts of them in ornate detail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you see this luxurious interior in the living room, or nice furniture, nice fabrics, nice wallpaper; this is a life that existed. Comfortable lives. Some people might have left nothing but also many people have left a lot, have risked so much to get here. They did not choose to leave, they did not come here on a vacation. They had to leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed chose to display the homes in suitcases because he felt everyone would be able to grasp what they represent - the emotional baggage that comes with leaving a whole life behind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a trauma both artists know well, with Ahmed and his family fleeing Iraq when he was seven and Mohamed's sister recently becoming a refugee in Sweden. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed, whose family spent two years in Syria before being resettled in America in 2008, interviewed families and saw his conversations turn into detailed models thanks to Mohamed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His interviews can be heard through headphones next to the suitcases in the museums across America where they've been exhibited, and one of the homes in the exhibition was his own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past three, three-and-a-half years I've been retelling my own story. And I realised that as I was retelling my own story it was empowering me, so I wanted to give other people that same feeling,&quot; Ahmed said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This project was the first time Ahmed and his family had discussed leaving Iraq, and seeing his house recreated by Mohamed was emotional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was really, really visceral to tangibly see something that fundamentally changed your life forever. And we're seeing it not just with my story, but for others that we've featured as part of Unpacked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the stories being told through Unpacked are quite remarkable. There's that of Fereshteh, an Afghan raised in Iran, who at 22 founded an underground school in the Islamic republic for the undocumented Afghan children unable to receive education legally. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school nurtured more than 300 children each day, and Mohamed chose to build the basement where they learned for Fereshteh's suitcase. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How suitcases and model homes are helping tell the stories of refugees from around the world instagram 2                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After applying for refugee status, Fereshteh arrived in the US three years later in 2011, where she's now a professor of Farsi at the University of New Haven, an active translator for refugees, and attending nursing school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph, a prominent lawyer who fled the Democratic Republic of Congo, told another of the stories that stuck with Ahmed. After receiving refugee status in Kenya, Joseph's son was kidnapped and is still missing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph's suitcase features a dining table with several chairs all around the table, except for one off to the side that represents his son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed said: &quot;When Joseph saw this he became very, very emotional, and it was very emotional for both me and Mohamed to witness that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're literally presenting someone with their own tragedy and their own triumph. It opens the door for many reactions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How suitcases and model homes are helping tell the stories of refugees from around the world instagram 3                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed believes that seeing the suitcases can have a therapeutic effect on the people they represent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They could've been more therapeutic if they made them themselves, but with that not being a possibility I think having their stories being out in the public and people coming to them and saying your story matters, you matter... you cannot escape these suitcases, you can't pass by them and pretend you've seen nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed also hopes his art can help people who call for travel bans and building walls to see refugees not as a monolith, but people with histories and lives and loves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We realised that if we introduced ourselves as Muslim Arab American artists we are going to get kicked out of the room immediately, because we've already been judged two million ways. So we said OK, how can we speak with our mouths shut?&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since starting the project Mohamed has filled 10 suitcases with aspects of the lives a family has left behind, and the duo hope to tell 50 stories to represent the 50 states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reception it has received promises to make that a reality, with immigrants and their descendants - a lot of them Jewish - donating suitcases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They resonate with this push back and xenophobia,&quot; Mohamed said. &quot;They've been donating to me their suitcases, their miniature dollhouses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing tells a more beautiful story about diversity and living together more than Christians, Jews, Muslims and atheists coming together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A suitcase that belonged to a Jewish immigrant, donated by their grandchildren, for a Muslim Syrian artist - using yesterday's immigrant's belongings to tell today's immigrant's stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the project Mohamed and Ahmed have connected with lots of refugees living in the US - from delivery drivers and doctors to professors, engineers and lawyers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's adamant he doesn't want his work to &quot;romanticise&quot; refugees, but humanise them, and also show that it's possible to &quot;move forward&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody goes through hardship. It is not the whole story, it is part of the story. That is not how the story ends,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     You can listen to Fereshteh, and other refugees, tell their stories here.                   </SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 50 refugees being held in camps on Manus Island and Nauru will be welcomed to start afresh in the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a deal struck between Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the Obama administration, some of the asylum seekers left stranded by Australia will be accepted as refugees into the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the initial number is only a small fraction of the nearly 1200 men, women and children in the island detention centres, Mr Turnbull said more would be taken in over time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech shared to his social media accounts on Wednesday night, he thanked US President Donald Trump for agreeing to honour the deal that was famously almost lost during a testy phone call between the world leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I thank the President and the United States for honouring the deal,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Vetting and processing by the United States will continue, and further decisions by US authorities in respect of others are expected in due course.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 800 men are being held on Manus, and 371 men, women and children are detained on Nauru, according to Australian immigration data as of July 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camps' conditions have been widely criticised by refugee advocates and medical professionals, who say some asylum-seekers suffer from mental health problems due to their prolonged detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A PNG court ruled last year that holding people on Manus was unconstitutional, and Canberra is set to shut the camp in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the lead-up to the closure of the camp, asylum seekers on the island have reported they have lost electricity and clean water in what they see as a move to force them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions have been high between locals and asylum seekers, as those detained in the camps complain of attacks on the processing centres and dangerous conditions in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'deal' between Australia and the United States involved the US accepting up to 1250 refugees in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, in return for Australia taking asylum seekers from Central America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1600 refugees have expressed interest in the US resettlement deal, but it remains unclear what will happen to those not taken by the United States.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the fate of the leftover refugees, Mr Turnbull insisted Australia's resettlement deal with Cambodia was still on offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to seven refugees have taken up the offer to resettle there but the majority have instead chosen to return to their countries of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia allocated $55 million to the Cambodia deal which is largely seen as a failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International urged Washington to take as many refugees as possible to ensure 'not a single person is left behind'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Amnesty International acknowledges the US for giving people a genuine chance at settling and restarting their lives in a safe place,' said the group's refugee coordinator Graham Thom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But for the sake of those still living in the harmful conditions on Nauru and Manus we are urging the US to take as many people off these islands as possible.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Law Centre echoed these sentiments, saying while some now had hope, the majority remained in limbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In signing the US deal our government was rightly conceding that it couldn't just abandon people on Nauru and Manus forever,' said the centre's director of legal advocacy Daniel Webb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That was an important and long overdue concession. Now, it is our government's responsibility to make sure not a single person is left behind. Not one life can be abandoned in limbo.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rights, protection and wellbeing of uprooted children should be central commitments of global migration policies, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Thursday, as it released a new report prior to a meeting next week on safe, regular and orderly migration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, taking place from 4 to 6 December in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, is a major step towards drafting the landmark intergovernmental Global Compact for Migration , an agreement covering all dimensions of international migration.<BR><BR>&quot;Global leaders and policymakers convening in Puerto Vallarta can work together to make migration safe for children,&quot; said UNICEF Director of Programmes Ted Chaiban.<BR><BR>It is the moment when world leaders will begin to forge consensus on political and financial commitments in line with the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.<BR><BR>The report, Beyond Borders: How to make the global compacts on migration and refugees work for uprooted children, highlights best practices for the care and protection of refugee and migrant children and includes examples of governments, civil society partners and host communities working to support and integrate uprooted children and their families.<BR><BR>&quot;Our new report shows that it is possible, even in countries with stretched resources, to implement policies, services and investments that effectively support refugee and migrant children in their countries of origin, as they transit across borders and upon reaching their destinations,&quot; said Mr. Chaiba.<BR><BR>Refugee and migrant children are especially vulnerable to xenophobia, abuse, sexual exploitation and lack of access to social services.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by South Korean news agency Yonhap on 22 November</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEOUL, 22 Nov:The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Filippo Grandi on Wednesday [22 November] urged relevant countries on Wednesday not to deport North Korean refugees who risk their lives in fleeing their country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I assured the foreign minister (Kang Kyung-wha) that UNHCR is concerned by the situation of North Korean refugees anywhere, especially given the situation of the human rights in North Korea,&quot; the high commissioner said in a press conference in Seoul. UNHCR is also known as the UN Refugee Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The appeal that I make all the time, to all the countries, is that North Korean asylum seekers and refugees should never be sent back to their country because they risk their lives,&quot; Grandi said. &quot;You know the principle 'people should not be deported when they are at risk' is especially valid for North Koreans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high commissioner also commended South Korea's government policy to automatically take North Korean defectors coming to South Korea as its own citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I commended the foreign minister for this policy. They don't need us to do this particular work,&quot; according to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, South Korea needs to do more to improve its system to take refugees from other part of the world, he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Korea is one of the few countries in the region that has had specific legislation for refugees since 2013 ... (but) the application of that law still needs to be improved,&quot; Grandi noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good refugee status determination systems need to be very precise &quot;because people come with very difficult stories,&quot; he said. &quot;If you make a mistake, if you say you are not refugees, so go back home, you may be risking this person's life. That's why it has to be almost like a medical examination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the process should also not be too slow. &quot;So you have to balance quality and speed. This is what needs to be improved in Korea and in many other places,&quot; the high commissioner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he suggested the improvement during his meeting with the South Korean justice minister and the minister &quot;fully accepted&quot; the government's cooperation on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Korea also committed its increased financial contribution to UNHCR, he also said, referring to his meetings with the foreign and justice ministers here as well as the acting head of South Korea's official development assistance provider KOICA, lawmakers and civic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thanked Korea for its growing support. Now Korea has been, for the last couple of years, part of the group of major donors for UNHCR,&quot; Grandi said. &quot;I was assured by the foreign ministry this trend will continue. I believe that Korea, as a G-20 country and a prosperous country, can afford to make even additional efforts to help us in the time refugees are increasing all over the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also extended special thanks to the South Korean public who doubled their financial assistance to UNHCR. This year the South Korean government provides UNHCR with about US$25 million in contribution, and UNHCR's target from the Korean public this year is $37 million, he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 22, 2017<BR><BR>With the number of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar arriving in south-east Bangladesh edging towards half a million, United Nations agencies are stepping up delivery of life-saving aid to two official refugee camps, where the health concerns are quickly growing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of Bangladeshi authorities, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is speeding up the distribution of plastic sheeting to get as many people as possible under at least minimal protection from monsoon rains and winds.<BR><BR>&quot;On Saturday, we plan to begin distribution of kitchen sets, sleeping mats, solar lamps and other essential relief items to an initial 3,500 families who have been selected by community leaders,&quot; UNHCR spokesperson Andrej Mahecic told a press briefing in Geneva.<BR><BR>Refugee volunteers and contractors are helping newly arriving refugees moving into emergency shelter, but it is vital that UNHCR site planners have the opportunity to lay out the new Kutupalong extension in an orderly way to adequately provide for sanitation and to make sure structures are erected on higher ground not prone to flooding.<BR><BR>In total, more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees are now believed to be in Bangladesh; 420,000 of them have arrived in the past three and a half weeks.<BR><BR>UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi will be in Bangladesh this weekend to get a first-hand look at the scale of the crisis as well as UNHCR's response, and meet with refugees.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that camps are bursting at the seams and there is a huge risk of disease.<BR><BR>&quot;WHO is very concerned about the health situation on the border between Myanmar and Bangladesh, given the very crowded settlements, most of them spontaneous,&quot; said Fadela Chaib, the agency's spokesperson in Geneva.<BR><BR>&quot;It has been challenging to roll out the emergency response, not least because of the difficult terrain and the very heavy rains, and the fact that the population in question is dispersed, mobile and often injured,&quot; she added.<BR><BR>Ms. Chaib said the greatest risk is related to water and sanitation, with poor conditions increasing the risk of vector- and water-borne diseases. Cholera, which is endemic in Bangladesh, cannot be ruled out. WHO has provided some 20,000 people with water purification tablets.<BR><BR>&quot;Immunization rates among children is very low,&quot; she said, explaining that when children are malnourished and exposed to the elements, the risk of childhood diseases such as measles are very high.<BR><BR>WHO, together with other agencies, recently launched an immunization campaign against polio and measles. Owing to the poor weather conditions and the continuous influx of people, the campaign has been extended.<BR><BR>Around 40 WHO staff have been dispatched to Bangladesh, and the agency will deploy a team of epidemiologists over the weekend to support risk assessment for infectious diseases.<BR><BR>For its part, the World Food Programme (WFP) has now reached at least 385,000 people with food aid as of today. Together with its partners, WFP feeds more than 5,000 people daily in the area.<BR><BR>&quot;The situation is dire and WFP is on the frontlines trying to reach people as quickly as possible,&quot; spokesperson Bettina Luescher told reporters in Geneva.         </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By BBC Monitoring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-Syrian government Lebanese politicians have seized on the controversy surrounding Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Backed by the Syrian ambassador and Hezbollah, they are pushing for closer coordination with Damascus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following fires in refugee camps and the death of several Syrians in a Lebanese army operation in the border area of Arsal, the issue of displaced Syrians came up during a 5 June cabinet meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want official contacts&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The push started on 2 July, when Naim Qassem - Hezbollah's second in charge - called for a joint Lebanese-Syrian committee to facilitate the return of some 1.5m Syrian refugees currently in Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Qassem's statements, Hezbollah-aligned ministers, led by the Syrian Social Nationalist Party's Ali Qanso, brought the issue to the cabinet meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their argument was simple: Refugees will not return to Syria without a return to close relations between the Lebanese government and its Syrian counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrian envoy to Beirut, Ali Abdulkarim, echoed this message in interviews with pro-Hezbollah media outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if Syria is on the verge of a major victory, the return of refugees will not happen without coordination between the two countries,&quot; Abdulkarim told al-Mayadeen TV channel. He said his government will cooperate to relieve Lebanon of the &quot;burden of refugees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with al-Diyar daily, he mocked Hariri's position: &quot;How come Hariri always says Lebanon will be a platform for Syria's reconstruction, then say he will not talk to Damascus? Does he imagine he will be air dropped into Syria?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International mediation is also off the table, according to Abdulkarim: &quot;Syria will not accept any mediation. Instead we want official contacts to solve this issue that threatens Lebanon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some Lebanese parties refusing to coordinate with Syria today are responsible, to a large extent, for luring Syrians in. They urged them to leave Syria so they can be used to put pressure on the Syrian government,&quot; the Syrian envoy told al-Akhbar daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both President Michel Aoun and Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri were eager to avoid the topic and go ahead with the cabinet's agenda, saying that controversial topics should be set aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reminder of the protectorate&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hariri said the government should coordinate on refugee issues with the UN and donor states and he informed the cabinet he will be visiting Washington, Moscow and Paris for talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Aoun warned of Syrian refugee camps becoming &quot;terrorist hotbeds&quot; but said the Lebanese state and judiciary should be strengthened in order to combat extremism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite being a Hezbollah ally, the president was keen to avoid the topic and concentrate instead on practical issues like appointing public servants or signing decrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanese media reports suggested he might appoint a presidential envoy from the security apparatus to coordinate with the Syrians without fracturing his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of State for Refugee Affairs Muayn al-Marabi, of Hariri's Future Movement, clearly said that &quot;the cabinet does not want to legitimise [Syrian President Bashar] al-Assad&quot;, according to pro-Syrian government Lebanese daily al-Akhbar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Planning Michel Pharaon told London-based al-Sharq al-Awsat daily: &quot;It is inappropriate to force the government to open a dialogue with Syria... This demand is not only related to refugees. They are talking about political dialogue. They want to use the issue of refugees to reach a broader coordination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian politicians in the Lebanese Forces and the Phalangist parties were also hostile to the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lebanese Forces vowed to present a compromise proposal in 10 days. They believe coordination should be put in place by the UN to facilitate the return of Syrians to &quot;safe zones&quot; within Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hezbollah negotiated with Israel to release its prisoners via a German mediator. Why don't we do the same thing?&quot; Phalangist Party Leader Sami Jemmayel said, calling for international support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Future Movement minister, Jammal Jarrah, told sympathetic Lebanese daily al-Nahar that &quot;the way the Syrian ambassador appeared to the Lebanese people is a stark reminder of the protectorate days&quot;, referencing Lebanon's de-facto occupation by Syria which ended in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This era will never return, no matter the cost,&quot; Jarrah said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian refugees in Lebanon will not accept returning to Syria through deals coordinated with the Syrian government, a Lebanese politician has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The circumstances in Syria have become suitable for their return and the decision in this regard is a sovereign Lebanese decision par excellence,&quot; Lebanese Forces (LF) leader Samir Geagea said on 22 September, according to news website Naharnet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the refugees realise that their return is conditional upon coordination with [Syrian President] Bashar al-Assad's regime, they won't return, because Bashar al-Assad himself was behind their displacement,&quot; he continued.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Lebanese President Michel Aoun and Foreign Affairs Minister Gebran Bassil have spoken out vehemently against the naturalisation of any refugees in Lebanon, stressing the &quot;need&quot; for Syrians to return to their home country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech at the UN General Assembly and in a series of tweets, Aoun said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mass migration to Lebanon happened because of security or economic reasons, so we consider them displaced, not refugees; it wasn't with the permission of the [host] state but more of a demographic invasion,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Claiming that the displaced are not safe in their country [Syria] is unacceptable. If Syria is striking reconciliation with armed groups, then how will it deal with those displaced from war?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lebanon will never allow for the naturalisation of any refugee or displaced person, no matter the cost. The decision on this lies with us and us alone.&quot; (http://bit.ly/2hpZlXk, http://bit.ly/2xYZ1JI, http://bit.ly/2xvsY2X)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Bassil tweeted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Naturalisation [of refugees/displaced] is refused in every way and we will use every means to challenge it so that it fails,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[US President Donald] Trump said that for the cost of hosting a displaced person in the US, they can help 10 in the region. I say that we [Lebanon] can help 100 in their country [Syria].&quot; (http://bit.ly/2foWRvj, http://bit.ly/2yjum67)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bassil met with his Syrian counterpart in New York earlier this week at the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session. (For more on the meeting, see: https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c1dm5vq8)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current government policy in Lebanon stipulates that any minister wishing to visit Syria would do so in their personal capacity and as such their visit would not be considered as official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last September, Bassil was quoted as saying: &quot;I support passing a law which allows a woman to grant her children [Lebanese] citizenship, except for [women married to] Syrians and Palestinians to protect our land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement attracted a furore, with many accusing the official of being &quot;sectarian, racist, and hateful&quot;, with calls for him to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign minister belongs to the Christian Maronite sect while many of the Syrians and Palestinians in Lebanon are perceived to belong to the Muslim faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated that Lebanon hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees, though the state does not recognise them as refugees and it is not party to the 1951 Convention relating to the State of Refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also 500,000 Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA in Lebanon, a UN organisation for Palestinian refugees in the Near East.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billed as Witney's 'international music event', Asylum Sounds will return later this month following a successful debut in the town last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People from Witney and further afield are invited to come and join the fun while supporting Witney Refugee Action Group at the Rock Barn on Saturday, September 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as music there will be family-friendly arts and crafts, mural painting, cake and street-food stalls and more running from 2pm to 11.30pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All cash raised on the night will go towards Witney Refugee Action Group's continued efforts to support refugees across the world from West Oxfordshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation is embarking on a new initiative to sponsor a refugee family to come to Witney through the Government's community resettlement scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luci Ashbourne, who is a member of the action group, is delighted the popular event will return to Witney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;We at Witney Refugee Action Group are thrilled to have the opportunity to bring Asylum Sounds back this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People can expect more of the same brilliant eclectic music, family-friendly crafts and inspirational message as last year, along with plenty of exciting new additions to the day, including launching 'Witney's Warm Welcome Quilt', where guests will be able to make a patch to be sewn in and we will present to the family we eventually welcome with the funds raised through the event itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All summer festivals need ice-cream, and this year Ben and Jerry's will be giving away free treats for gig-goers in support of the company's Together for Refugees campaign, which is calling for more refugee resettlement across Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County councillor for Witney Laura Price is also thrilled to see the outward-looking event's second outing. She said it was important to show how much in common people in this country share with others overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Asylum Sounds is an amazing coming together of the Witney community, welcoming the Syrian families who have been resettled here and raising vital funds to support others fleeing violence, persecution and war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reminds us not only of how fortunate we are to live in such a wonderful town, but also how much we have in common with others no matter where in the world their journey began.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam and the Red Cross will also be supporting the multi-genre music event, and some very special guest speakers will be appearing on the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was last year that the group's first ever international music event was held in Witney, raising &pound;2,000 for an Oxfordshire organisation supporting asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event was compered by local poet Owen Collins and brought together a multitude of established musical genres as well some distinctly new ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This included West African, Turkish gypsy ('Turkabilly Gyp-hop'), Gallic flavoured rock and roll and Captain Beefheart-inspired pop. This year's line-up is still being decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Asylum Sounds is at The Rock Barn, Market Square, Witney, on Saturday. September 30, from 2-11.30pm</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Merkel has agreed to cap the number of refugees arriving in Germany at 200,000, as a concession during coalition negotiations to form a new government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German chancellor, who has opened up Germany's borders to people fleeing the wars in the Middle East and Africa, made the concession to secure the support of the regional Bavarian party the CSU (Christian Social Union).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSU, the regional sister party of Ms Merkel's CDU, is more conservative than its counterpart in the rest of Germany and had demanded a more right-wing approach from the Chancellor to secure its support.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel makes 'binoculars' motion as May left on sidelines at EU summit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change of policy comes after the far-right AfD party did well in the German federal elections last month, securing third place and becoming the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag in half a century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AfD made significant ground in the elections by playing off fears and concerns about refugees and migration in general, and after the results became clear Ms Merkel said she would try to solve the problems of people who had voted for the party to win their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though a million refugees came to Germany at the height of the refugee crisis, the number has actually tailed off over, with 280,000 welcomed to Germany in the recent year. As a result, if numbers continue to decline, Germany may not have to turn refugees away as part of the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's commitment still dwarfs that of the UK, which pledged to take just 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years - or 4,000 a year. The CSU-CDU agreement says that &quot;the total number of the intake based on humanitarian reasons ... shall not exceed 200,000 a year&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal may actually be politically advantageous to Ms Merkelbecause it allows her to change course on a policy costing her party votes in some areas, without suffering the humiliation of aself-inflicted U-turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters in Brussels a European Commission spokesperson said: &quot;What we can say in general terms is that the Commission considers it extremely positive that the country that has already taken in more than one million refugees is showing readiness to welcome a further 200,000 persons a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Commission and its president has repeatedly stressed how much we welcome the leading role Germany has been playing in managing the refugee crisis and shaping a joint European approach to migration to which this commission has also been central.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After securing the support of the CSU, against which the CDU does not stand in election, Ms Merkel now faces the harder task of securing the support of the liberals and greens - who she will need to form a majority government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Jamaica coalition&quot; - so-called because the parties' colours resemble the Jamaican flag - has never been tried at a national level before, thought it has occurred in Germany's state parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coalition is Ms Merkel's only real option after her old grand coalition partners, the centre-left SPD, decided to return to opposition to lick their wounds after a historically awful election result last month.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the Operational Committee of the EU Trust Fund for Africa adopted a new set of 13 programmes worth EUR174.4 million for the Horn of Africa region.<BR><BR>This new package complements 40 previously adopted actions amounting to EUR 665 million for the Horn of Africa. Approved in five packages in December 2015, April 2016, October 2016, December 2016 and April 2017, these actions all contribute to improving stability and addressing the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement in the Horn of Africa region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the previously adopted actions for the Horn of Africa, over EUR410 million have already been contracted. Among these are national projects in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda, and regional projects in support of the Khartoum Process.<BR><BR>Summary of the projects announced today:<BR><BR>Djibouti<BR><BR>The programme 'Durable solutions for host populations, refugees and vulnerable migrants' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR15 million) aims at supporting the government to help manage the effects of increased mixed migration flows. Support will be provided in the sectors particularly affected, such as social security, healthcare and sanitation, as well as to protect all vulnerable children, and to enable the national office for refugees to better respond to the needs of refugees and vulnerable migrants. This includes protection and legal aid, hence supporting Djibouti in the implementation of the pledges made for the Common Refugee Response Framework (CRRF). The programme will be implemented by the World Food Programme and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in collaboration with other partners.<BR><BR>Ethiopia<BR><BR>The programme 'Leather Initiative for Sustainable Employment Creation (LISEC) in Ethiopia' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR15 million) aims at creating greater economic and decent employment opportunities, especially for young men and women through the development of the Ethiopian leather industry and the Modjo leather industrial park. This programme proposes a new vision towards inclusive and sustainable industrial development that protects the environment and supports social inclusion. The programme will be implemented by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Industrial Parks Development Corporation (IPDC) and by a partnership of national and international non-governmental organisations.<BR><BR>The programme 'Stimulating economic opportunities and job creation for refugees and host communities in Ethiopia in support of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) in Ethiopia' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR20 million) aims at supporting the implementation of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) to shift from a 'care and maintenance' or camp-based model of refugee assistance to an approach, which emphasises refugee self-reliance, refugee mobility in-country and the integration of refugees into regional and national development processes. The programme will be implemented by UNHCR, the World Bank and organisations with experience in private sector development.<BR><BR>The programme 'Shire Alliance: Energy Access for Host Communities and Refugees in Ethiopia' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR3.05 million) aims atimproving the living conditions in host and refugee communities by creating livelihood opportunities, enhancing local capacity building and improving access to energy services. The beneficiaries are around 40 000 members of the host and refugee communities in and around Adi-Harush, Mai Aini and Hitsats refugee camps. The programme will be implemented by the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development (AECID).<BR><BR>Somalia<BR><BR>The programme 'Building Resilience in Northern Somalia - RESTORE 2' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR 13.5 million) aims at addressing the impact of the severe drought affecting northern Somalia and to strengthen the resilience of the most affected communities in northern Somalia. This project will achieve this by scaling-upthe current RESTOREproject through cash transfers, construction of productive infrastructure and assets and capacity building of local authorities and communities. The programme will be implemented by NGOs and the FAO.<BR><BR>The programme 'Enhancing security and the rule of law in Somalia' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR40 million) aims at increasing the presence and efficacy of police throughout the Federal Member States whilst at the same time connecting this increased law enforcement to a more accessible, reliable and competent justice provision. The primary beneficiaries will be those individuals who are or who will become police officers and/or judiciary personnel as well as those who will benefit from the increased law enforcement and access to justice. The programme will be implemented by the UN's multi-partner trust fund office and/or other UN agencies.<BR><BR>South Sudan<BR><BR>The programme 'Education in Emergency Programme in Four Former States in South Sudan' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR22.4 million) will focus on school-age children attending primary schools in South Sudan (aged 6-18), primary school teachers, school staff, Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) and the education system in general in the former four states Northern Bahr el Ghazal (NBEG), Western Bahr el Ghazal (WBeG), Warrap and Eastern Equatoria. It aims at improving access to quality learning opportunities for 75 000 children, including by providing them with daily school meals throughout the academic year. The programme will be implemented by UNICEF and the World Food Programme.<BR><BR>The programme 'South Sudan Rural Development: Strengthening Smallholders' Resilience - SORUDEV SSR' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR7 million) aims at contributing to strengthening resilience of communities, improving governance and conflict prevention and reducing forced displacement due to loss of livelihoods. Its specific objectives are to improve food security of rural smallholders in Greater Bahr el Ghazal and to empower them to cope with environmental volatility and insecurity. The programme will be implemented by FAO.<BR><BR>The 'Technical Cooperation Facility for South Sudan 2018-2020' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR2 million) aims at contributing to an efficient and effective use of the development funds the EU implements in South Sudan, focusing also on the transition and/or complementarity between the humanitarian response and the medium-long term development response.<BR><BR>Sudan<BR><BR>The programme 'Fostering Smallholder Capacities and Access to Markets in Food Insecure Areas of Darfur' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR8 million) aims at enhancing the food and income security of smallholder farming households in Darfur. Its specific objectives are to: i) Increase household food availability by reducing pre-farm gate losses; ii) Empower smallholders to sell surplus grain at higher prices; iii) Strengthen capacity of smallholders and farmer's groups to access markets and value chains. Approximately 65 000 farmers are to be reached by the Action, which will target South, West and Central Darfur States. It aims to develop and test a model that can be amended and replicated across the range of contexts that exist for smallholder farmers in Darfur. The programme will be implemented by the World Food Programme.<BR><BR>The programme 'Integrated Measures to promote rural-urban value addition and Employment (IMPROVE-EU)' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR8 million) aims at contributing to improved livelihoods of refugees, migrant workers and host communities in Eastern Sudan. Its specific objectives are (1) to increase farmers' incomes; (2) to provide viable solutions to adapt farming systems to markets and to climate variability; (3) to provide farmers with new techniques to increase their production. The action will address 1,600 farmer households and around 30 high potential small and medium local enterprises working in the selected value chains will be engaged in project activities. The project will be implemented by GIZ, the German Corporation for International Cooperation (GmbH).<BR><BR>The programme 'PROTECT - Protection of Persons of Concern and vulnerable migrants along migratory routes in Sudan' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR4 million) aims at contributing to improve the management of mixed migration flows in Sudan. Its specific objective is to improve the protection of Persons of Concern, including refugees, returnees, stateless people, internally displaced people and asylum-seekers, and other vulnerable migrants along the Northern migration route through 1) improved access to assistance and protection, 2) enhancing the capacity of police and judiciary to respond to the needs of Persons of Concern (PoC), including asylum seekers and other vulnerable migrants and 3) the improvement of the referral system. The project will be implemented by Danish Red Cross and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).<BR><BR>Uganda:<BR><BR>Theprogramme 'RISE - Response to increased demand on Government Service and creation of economic opportunities in Uganda' (EU Trust Fund contribution: EUR20 million) aims at strengthening the abilities of local authorities to cater for refugee populations in planning social service provision in their areas (e.g. access to water services and education), hence supporting Uganda in implementing the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) and supporting Refugee and Host Population Empowerment (ReHope). Its specific objectives are 1) to strengthen local authorities' coordination and development &amp; contingency planning, as well as local authority-led service delivery to refugees and the host populations and 2) to increase economic self-reliance of refugees and host populations. The programme will be implemented by GIZ and civil society organisations.<BR><BR>The Trust Fund for Africa is being continuously monitored, in order to most effectively respond to changing needs. This is why today, amendments to reduce the funding for two projects by EUR22.6 million have been approved (IMPACT South Sudan - now EUR31.961 million and support to stabilisation through improved resource, economic and financial management in South Sudan (PFM) - now EUR3 million). The above mentioned amount serves to contribute to the financing of new actions approved at the same Operational Committee held in December 2017 (education in emergency and food security actions). The re-orientation of our interventions follows a continuous assessment of the situation in South Sudan after violence erupted again in July 2016.<BR><BR>For More Information<BR><BR>Press release - EU Trust Fund for Africa: new actions worth EUR174.4 million to support refugees and foster stability in the Horn of Africa<BR><BR>The EU Trust Fund for Africa<BR><BR>MEMO/17/5228<BR><BR>Press contacts:<BR><BR>Carlos MARTIN RUIZ DE GORDEJUELA (+32 2 296 53 22)<BR><BR>Christina WUNDER (+32 2 299 22 56)<BR><BR>General public inquiries: Europe Direct by phone 00 800 67 89 10 11 or by email<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spacious property - worth an estimated &pound;400,000 - is in Home Secretary Amber Rudd's constituency of historic Rye, East Sussex.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The furnished end-of-terrace home has been empty for two years but is now reserved for &quot;imminent arrivals&quot; by Rother Council, which has 1,132 people waiting for social housing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property, close to the harbour and with on-street parking, was previously used as accommodation for needy young people.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are expected within weeks. Ukip home affairs spokeswoman Jane Collins said: &quot;What more proof do we need of the Government not putting British people first?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UK has always assisted genuine refugees and should continue to do so but the simple facts remain that people who are British, who have paid their taxes and contributed to the system, should be the first priority of both local and central government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the people waiting for social housing, 158 want three-bedroom homes, 31 are looking for four-bedroom properties, six need five bedrooms and one is waiting for a six-bedroomed house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has committed to resettling 20,000 refugees from the Middle East and north Africa by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 7,000 Syrians have already arrived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the refugee crisis remains in the international spotlight, it's a good time to take note of what they're capable of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees are people who have escaped their home countries to flee war, natural disaster, or persecution. Today, there are more than 65 million refugees in the world, the most since World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of their struggles, refugees have made great contributions to society. Inspired by the New York Times's list of 25 great books by refugees in America, here's a list of refugees who are so accomplished that they've become international celebrities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Singer Regina Spektor was born in the Soviet Union in 1980. Her family fled from Moscow to the United States when she was nine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Emma McIntyre/Getty Images)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of Spektor's parents studied music and gave her training as a classical musician from a young age. In the United States, she continued her studies and eventually became a pop musician, with songs like &quot;Samson&quot; and &quot;Us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she was one year old, singer and actress Rita Ora's family escaped ethnic persecution in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Getty Images)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ora was born to Albanian parents in Yugoslavia (now present-day Kosovo). With the disintegration of Yugoslavia, ethnic Albanians faced persecution. She relocated to London, and now she's a singer, actress, and model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actress Mila Kunis came to Los Angeles from Ukraine on a religious refugee visa in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Getty)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the Holocaust, in Russia you were not allowed to be religious,&quot; Kunis told The Sun. &quot;So my parents raised me to know I was Jewish. You know who you are inside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Playwright Tom Stoppard was born in Czechoslovakia. He left before the Nazis got to his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day Nazis began to invade Czechoslovakia, the future author of classic plays like &quot;Arcadia&quot; and &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; fled the war and escaped the Nazi mass murder of Jews. His parents took him to Singapore, one of the countries where his father's company was resettling employees. Nazis murdered his four grandparents, who could not leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later, Stoppard's family had to escape again, when the Japanese invaded Singapore. He, his siblings, and his mother went to Darjeeling, India, while his father volunteered in the British army (he died during the war in 1942). After the war, they settled in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she was nine years old, rapper M.I.A.'s primary school was destroyed in a government raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(MIA)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though she was born in London, her family moved to Sri Lanka when she was less than a year old. Her father campaigned for an independent state for ethnic Tamils, and a civil war over the issue forced her family to flee. They settled in India, briefly, before moving to London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen left Vietnam -- and he has a forthcoming short story collection about refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nguyen's family fled Vietnam after the fall of Saigon in 1975, moving to Pennsylvania and, later, California. His novel &quot;The Sympathizer,&quot; about a Viet Cong agent who infiltrates the South Vietnam army and later comes to America, won 2016's Pulitzer Prize for fiction. His next book, &quot;The Refugees,&quot; is a short story collection written over 20 years. It'll be released in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is precisely because I do not look like a refugee that I have to proclaim being one,&quot; Nguyen wrote in The New York Times. &quot;Even when those of us who were refugees would rather forget that there was a time when the world thought us to be less than human.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rapper K'Naan escaped the Somali civil war at the age of 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and his family lived in New York for about a year before reconnecting with his father in Toronto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, a Coca Cola campaign using his song &quot;Wavin' Flag&quot; made him an international celebrity. He's also rapped about his experience in songs like &quot;Take a Minute.&quot; Through his music and political activism, he's opposed the war in Somalia and supported programs that aid refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left Czechoslovakia before the Holocaust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disintegration of the state by Adolf Hitler led her family to flee, moving to England. After World War II, Albright's family returned to the reestablished Czechoslovakia until the Communist government took over. Then, she moved to New York and has called the United States her home since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1997, she became the first female Secretary of State and the highest ranking woman in the history of the United States. In her memoir &quot;Madame Secretary,&quot; she wrote about how she found out she was born Jewish only later in her life, and that her family escaped ethnic cleansing as well as political persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Satirical novelist Gary Shteyngart and his family were discriminated against as Jews in the Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His family moved to New York City when he was a child, an experience he wrote about in his memoir &quot;Little Failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shteyngart first became famous for his novel &quot;Super Sad True Love Story,&quot; and he's also written satires of the Soviet Union with &quot;The Russian Debutante's Handbook&quot; and &quot;Absurdistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Singer-songwriter Gloria Estefan was born in Havana, Cuba, at the height of the Cold War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Theo </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wargo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">/Getty Images)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her family fled to Florida after the Cuban Revolution, where her father joined the American army and participated in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Estefan herself gained citizenship in 1974, joined the legendary band Miami Sound Machine, and now has seven Grammys for her four-decade music career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media personality Dr. Ruth Westheimer was sent to Switzerland while her mother and grandmother were murdered in the Holocaust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After World War II, Dr. Ruth immigrated to Mandatory Palestine and fought in the war for Israeli independence. She later moved to France and the United States, where she's become known for her psychology scholarship and activism in humanitarianism and in franker discussions about sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supermodel Iman's parents fought for Somali independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barnard/Getty Images)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's first black supermodel went to boarding school in Egypt, but when a coup in Somalia upended the government, her family had to flee indefinitely. They resettled in Kenya at first, before traveling to other places around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After retiring from modeling in the 1990s, Iman made a name for herself with her philanthropic work and by pioneering a line of cosmetics for a diverse range of skin tones.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defend Europe had raised more than a $100,000 on payment website Patreon to fund their mission to obstruct NGO vessels from rescuing migrants who had set sail from North Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures show more than 2,300 refugees drowned in the Mediterranean last year, often setting out in makeshift or crowded vessels, in their bid to reach the shores of EU countries including Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial blow to Defend Europe's campaign comes just days after their C-Star ship went adrift in the Mediterranean when its engine shut down, forcing nearby vessels to answer a distress call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group had been raising money on the Patreon online payment website through an account named &quot;European Identity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian right-wing commentator Lauren Southern set up the profile page which raised the funds for Defend Europe to set sail last month in their mission to stop refugee boats from leaving the coast of Libya.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activist and self-styled independent journalist had promoted the organisation's Generation Identity fundraising campaign mission through a YouTube video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement by Patreon to Ms Southern read: &quot;It appears that you are currently raising funds in order to take part in activities that are likely to cause loss of life. We have therefore decided to remove your page from Patreon, and paid out your final balance of $95.00 to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added: &quot;We understand that this will come as a disappointment. Please know that we have come to this decision after a long review process and will not consider an appeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives at the crowd-funding platform investigated Ms Southern's profile after a lobbying campaign by groups including Hope for Hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Southern claimed money she had raised through Patreon was related to her independent journalism work and no funds were diverted to the Defend Europe cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patreon executives did not immediately reply to a query when contacted to comment further over its decision to shut down the activist's profile page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate crowdfunding webpage for Defend Europe on the platform WeSearchr remains active and has raised more than $200,000 through donations from some 3,000 contributors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right-wing group states on its profile page: &quot;It's a mission to save Europe, to stop illegal immigration, and end the dying on the sea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The California-based websitewhich hosts their profile page insisted it would not remove it despitethe activists' pledge to block migrants from seeking refuge in the EU.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthee Carassava, Athens</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">545 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor of Lesbos has lambasted the Greek government for turning a blind eye to the scale of migrant arrivals, accusing it of wanting to turn the island into Europe's Guantanamo Bay prison for refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusation by Spiros Galinos, a popular polo player turned island mayor, comes amid mounting anger among increasingly unruly islanders over rising numbers of asylum seekers. Lesbos has been the gateway for more than a million migrants and refugees who arrived in Europe at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 11,047 refugees are stranded on the island, according to United Nations data. Most of them are crammed into a state-run camp in Moria that was initially established to house no more than 2,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a long time now I have been trying to convince Mr [Ioannis] Mouzalas, the migration minister, to decongest these facilities and the island altogether,&quot; said Mr Galinos. Instead, the minister was intent on turning Lesbos &quot;into Europe's Guantanamo prison in a bid to establish an ugly deterrent for refugees and migrants&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 60,00 migrants and refugees who first arrived in Greece in 2015 remain trapped in the country after a string of Balkan states put up razor fences and tightened border control to block migrant journeys to the heart of Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, on the forefront of the refugee crisis, Lesbos and its population of 86,000 have been left to cope with the biggest concentration of asylum seekers in the country. About 5,000 more remain trapped on other Aegean islands, in line with a landmark EU agreement signed with Turkey last year to stem migration of mainly Syrian refugees to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although inflows have dropped dramatically since then, fast-track asylum procedures designed to process asylum requests within weeks have yet to be set up, keeping migrants, including families and minors, stuck in overcrowded detention centres in miserable conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrivals have surged from 56 daily entries in September to roughly four times that figure, mainly in Lesbos. In the past week alone UN data showed 882 illegal entries, pushing the number of sea arrivals to 26,499 since the start of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of them, only 642 refugees have been returned to Turkey, in line with the EU migration deal that allows for mass deportations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday thousands of locals walked off work, spilling into the streets of Lesbos in the biggest demonstration in decades to demand mass relocation of refugees to the Greek mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're at a dangerous breaking point,&quot; Mr Galinos told The Times. &quot;The government has to finally act. Alternatively, it will be accountable for what may follow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today 19 humanitarian groups served the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, with an open letter calling on his radical left government to heed Lesbos's request for migration transfers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This remains a matter of life and death,&quot; said Jana Frey, the International Rescue Committee's country director in Greece. &quot;There is absolutely no excuse for the conditions on the islands right now - thousands of people crammed into overcrowded and desperately under-resourced facilities. We are in a race against time. Lives will be lost - again - this winter, unless people are allowed to move, in an organised and voluntary fashion, to the mainland.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucked away in a quiet corner of the Aegean, Tilos is an island of crimson bougainvillea cascading over whitewashed houses, ancient stone terraces and goats - lots of goats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years its main claim to fame was a cave in which the remains of pygmy elephants - the last to roam Europe, until around 4,000 years ago - were discovered by paleontologists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Tilos has now earned a new distinction, as a place that has actively welcomed refugees fleeing the war in Syria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islanders say their decision to embrace a dozen refugee families - around 70 people in total - offers an example to the rest of Greece, where more than 60,000 refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries languish in limbo in camps, waiting to be granted asylum and allowed to settle in other EU countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think that the arrangement we have here could be a model that could be exported to the rest of Greece and the whole of Europe,&quot; Maria Kamma, the mayor, said in her office in Megalo Horio, the tiny 'capital' of Tilos, a village that clings to the slopes of a craggy mountain beneath a ruined castle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a little island like ours can support 12 families, then others can do the same, in proportion to their population. Bigger communities can take larger numbers. We can solve the refugee problem,&quot; the mayor told The Telegraph.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of refugees settled in Tilos may seem small, but in proportion to the island's resident population, which is barely 500, it is significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the miserable camps in other parts of Greece where refugees have nothing to do, those on Tilos are becoming integrated into the fabric of daily life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost all the adults - aside from mothers looking after small children - have found work, in hotels and restaurants, shops, the island's bakery or as day labourers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They live in a purpose-built camp in the middle of Livadia, the island's port, where tourists eat grilled fish and tsatsiki in seafront tavernas. It is hardly luxurious - families live in Portakabins grouped around a communal cooking area and a shower block.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But trees provide splashes of shade, a fresh layer of gravel keeps down the dust and there is plenty of room for the children to run around.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions are immeasurably better than in other, much larger camps on Aegean islands such as Lesbos and Chios, where refugees have been stuck since crossing in boats from nearby Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those asylum seekers, many of them women and small children, are suffering ever greater levels of &quot;psychological stress&quot; and despair, according to the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tilos, in contrast, the children go to Greek and English lessons and will start attending schools on the island in September.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like the lessons, and playing outside, and having my friends around,&quot; said Nour, an outgoing eight-year-old Syrian girl, speaking in confident Greek rather than her native Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading a toddler by the hand in the shade of a eucalyptus tree, Mohsen Barak, 42, from&nbsp; the city of Al-Hasakah in north-eastern Syria, has been on Tilos for seven months. &quot;It is so much better than where we were before. We were on Rhodes, in a refugee camp inside an old slaughter yard. It was bad, really bad. We spent nearly a year there,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleni Kymina, 35, teaches the children Greek several times a week. &quot;The kids really want to learn, they want to play music - all the things they didn't have a chance to do in the past,&quot; the teacher said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp was established about a year ago by Solidarity Now, a Greek NGO, with help from UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The refugees are much happier than they were at first, especially now they have found jobs. It's not good to sit around all day with nothing to do, you become depressed,&quot; said Spiros Aliferis, a team leader from the NGO. &quot;They're part of our community. The kids go to the playground in the village, they swim in the sea. And they pick up Greek quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many Greek islands, Tilos has suffered from chronic depopulation in the past. Up in the hills, away from the beaches and bays, lies the abandoned village of Mikro Chorio.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goats wander through deserted houses, while others are boarded up with bits of rusting corrugated iron.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The village's inhabitants drained away after the Second World War, seeking new lives in Athens, the United States and Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of the refugees has injected money into the island. They receive a modest allowance from the UNHCR and spend the money in local shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there are plans to build a cheese factory on Tilos, to take advantage of the milk produced by the 15,000 goats that wander its herb-scented mountains and valleys.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some shepherds use the milk and one or two make their own cheese but it's for their own consumption. There's a big potential,&quot; said Stathis Kontos, special adviser to the mayor.&nbsp; It is hoped that the cheese factory will provide jobs for both Syrians and locals.&nbsp; &quot;The locals will provide the expertise and the refugees will provide the manpower,&quot; said Mr Kontos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enterprise will help diversify Tilos' dependence on tourism as the mainstay of its economy.&nbsp; A two-hour boat ride from Rhodes, the island is popular with a small but loyal crowd of British, Italians and Scandinavians, many of whom come year after year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tilos has a permanent population of just 500, but thousands of tourists arrive in the summer months.Credit:      Nick Squires     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some fall in love with the place so much that they buy houses and live there all year round. Ian Beesley, 70, originally from Oldham, moved here nearly 20 years ago and lives in a villa overlooking the sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This island could be an example of how to deal with the refugee problem and integrate them into communities. There is a genuine feeling of compassion here,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they also want to build up the population. At one point the ratio of kids to teachers was three to one. I have only encountered one guy with anything negative to say about the refugees,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the refugees hope to be reunited with relatives already settled in Germany or other EU countries, but the mayor hopes the rest will remain and rebuild their shattered lives on Tilos. &quot;I'd like them to stay. They're human beings. It's their right to live in humane conditions. Tilos is a place where we can support their dreams of a peaceful life,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's dirty little secret lies at the end of a winding country lane, in a valley dotted with ancient olive trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surrounded by wire fences and in places waist-high in rubbish, Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos is home to 7,000 people from more than a dozen nations, who are squeezed into a space that was meant to accommodate just 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, two years after a million migrants and refugees crossed into Europe, living conditions are becoming even more intolerable, as a fresh wave of refugees and migrants arrive on the Greek islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of them are Syrian and Iraqi families who have been able to escape Raqqa and Mosul after those cities were liberated from Isil.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moria camp is officially closed to journalists but The Telegraph was able to enter to discover what living conditions inside are really like.Credit:      Nick Squires     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spike in arrivals has been building since September, when 2,400 came - double the number that arrived in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were followed by 2,300 people in October and 2,000 in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 60 per cent of arrivals have been women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last four months, a total of 16,000 migrants and refugees have arrived on Greece's Aegean islands from the Turkish coast, paying smugglers around $500 per head for the crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to stay warm, refugees burn scavenged wood, as well as plastic bottles, plastic bags and other rubbish, in Moria refugee camp on Lesbos.Credit:      Nick Squires     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers are still lower than they were at&nbsp;the peak of the migration crisis in 2015, when thousands reached the beaches daily, but they are enough to put immense strain on the camp in Lesbos and others like it on the islands of Kos, Samos, Leros and Chios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation on Lesbos and in Moria camp is the worst that it has been since the crisis of 2015,&quot; said Sahar Mallah, from Oxfam, who works in the camp. &quot;People are living in tents in freezing temperatures and there are huge concerns about the lack of sanitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is rare for journalists to be given access to the facility, but The Sunday Telegraph found an unguarded gate along one part of the perimeter fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp is filthy - bins are overflowing and in places the rubbish is piled up waist-high.Credit:      Nick Squires     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That people are able to wander at will through the camp is testament to the institutionalised neglect that appears to characterise the Greek authorities' running of Moria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is not enough room for everybody in the white metal containers set up by the government, so around 3,000 people, including pregnant women, new-born babies and toddlers, sleep in tiny tents and under tarpaulins, which are set up on every available inch of space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of them are likely to have to spend the entire winter in tents - a predicament that NGOs say is totally unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are large numbers of young children and even babies inside the camp, many of them refugees from Syria and Iraq.Credit:      Nick Squires     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last winter, snow fell on Lesbos and five people died in Moria, at least two of them as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from makeshift heating devices that refugees were using to warm their freezing tents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same is likely to happen this year unless urgent measures are taken - of which there is scant sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp now resembles a giant shanty town, its lanes and alleyways strewn with discarded food containers, used nappies, chicken bones and plastic bottles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some women are so scared to go to the bathroom at night that they have taken to wearing adult nappies so as to avoid venturing out into the darkness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The women requested diapers because they feel so unsafe. I've worked in the Middle East and Asia and I've never heard of this happening before. We are in Europe and it is totally unacceptable,&quot; said Ms Mallah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a phenomenon that will occur when you have this many people crowded together in such bad conditions. There are women having to share tents with men they don't know and they are very, very afraid. I've never seen that before in a refugee camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As conditions deteriorate, so too does people's mental health. There has been a sharp increase in the number of refugees being referred to psychologists for suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, self-harm and panic attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One refugee walked into a clinic in Lesbos this week with a piece of rope, which he had tied into a noose.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the space of just five days this month, more than 100 migrants and refugees were referred to a mental health clinic in Mytilini, the main town on Lesbos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The island has become a glorified detention centre. A patient recently said to me 'Moria is the small jail, the island is the big jail.' The situation is deteriorating and it is happening at an alarming rate,&quot; said Aria Danika, a project coordinator from Medecins Sans Frontieres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People have had their spirit crushed because they don't know how long they will stay here. The asylum process is very long and extremely convoluted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of firewood means that refugees often use plastic bottles and bags to fuel their camp fires, creating acrid, choking black smoke that drifts across the camp.Credit:      Nick Squires     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the chronic overcrowding, Athens announced this week that it hopes to transfer 5,000 of the most vulnerable refugees, including women and children, from the islands to the mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the mayor of Lesbos is sceptical about the government's capability to carry out the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not confident that the refugees will be moved any time soon,&quot; said Spyros Galinos, who has compared Moria camp to Guantanamo Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Conditions in Moria are tragic and inhumane. It's nearly winter and people's lives are at stake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Galinos has fiercely resisted calls by the government in Athens to make Moria larger in order to ease the overcrowding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've done more than enough already. It's completely unfair that a few small islands should shoulder the burden in a huge humanitarian crisis,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are currently around 15,000 asylum seekers held in camps on the Aegean islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are stuck in limbo, waiting to hear whether they will be granted asylum and allowed to settle in the EU - or rejected and sent back to Turkey, from where they crossed in boats to Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some refugees and migrants have been stuck in the camp on Lesbos for months, waiting for their asylum applications to be considered.Credit:      Nick Squires     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moria is so overcrowded that hundreds of refugees live in tents outside the camp, in an olive grove where many trees have been cut down for firewood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children play in little groups, scampering up and down a muddy bank while their parents go about the numbing daily routine of camp life - queuing for food or sweeping the space outside their tents with bunches of twigs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no hot water at Moria and the few showers are clogged with human faeces and rubbish, so people wash with ice-cold water from plastic pipes. In the afternoon, as the sun sinks behind the hills and the temperature plunges, they light fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is not enough firewood to scavenge so they burn plastic bags and bottles, creating an acrid stench and dense plumes of black smoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very, very cold at night. To get food you have to queue for two or three hours and then it might be just a piece of cake,&quot; said Mustafa Mohib, 24, an engineer from Kabul, who has been at the camp for three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sleeps in a small tent, set up on wooden pallets, with three other Afghan men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have nothing to do - we just walk around. We may have to wait three months, one year, two years - we don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people have been here for 20 months - ever since March last year, when the EU signed a (EURO)3 billion deal with Turkey designed to stop the refugee flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the camp's perimeter wall, the words &quot;Welcome to prison Moria&quot; have been sprayed in large black letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the refugees don't even have socks - they walk around in flip-flops. Stray dogs wander through the camp, some of which have been adopted by refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With people having to queue for so long for meals, clashes inevitably break out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children's clothes are hung out to dry on the perimeter fence of the camp. When it rains, people living in tents often end up with wet clothing and shoes.Credit:      Nick Squires     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very bad. There's often fighting in the food queues - then the police tell everyone to go away, so you end up with nothing to eat,&quot; said Mohamoud Hajji Ibrahim, 23, from Somalia, who emerged from an olive grove brushing his teeth with a twig snapped off a tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former cameraman for a Somali television channel, he says he fled after being beaten and threatened with death by al-Shabaab extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how long I will be here - two years maybe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complexity of scrutinising thousands of asylum requests and a lack of trained personnel means that Lesbos and the other islands have become a giant bottleneck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those whose asylum bids are turned down are supposed to be returned to Turkey, but since the returns policy began in March last year, only 1,400 have been sent back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Turkey-EU agreement remains valid, although we would like to see more returns because that will restore the order of things. Things need to move faster,&quot; Ioannis Mouzalas, the Greek migration minister, told Greek media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some NGOs wonder privately whether the government is deliberately keeping the camps in a deplorable state, in order to deter more refugees from trying to reach the islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dozen humanitarian organisations are calling on the Greek government to empty the islands and transfer all the asylum seekers to the mainland, where conditions are better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 7,000 migrants and refugees are crammed into a facility that was designed for 2,000, with many of them living in tents.Credit:      Nick Squires     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that would contravene the EU-Turkey deal, which calls for people to be kept on the islands until their applications can be dealt with. The result is deadlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless there's a big policy shift I'm afraid the islands will be sacrificed. I'm very pessimistic,&quot; said Ms Danika, the project coordinator from MSF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lesbos has become the Nauru of Europe,&quot; she said, referring to the tiny South Pacific island to which Australia outsources its asylum seekers. Refugees who have seen their homes destroyed, relatives killed or maimed and who endured month-long journeys of extreme hardship say that even they are shocked by the conditions they encounter on the islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Ali, 26, from Nasiriyah in Iraq, has been in Moria camp for two weeks. He shares a tiny tent with two other men. They have no mattresses or sleeping mats, just thin blankets laid on the ground sheet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before I came, I spoke to friends who had made the journey and they explained to me what it would be like. But I had no idea it would be as bad as this. It's much worse than they told me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What?- Refugees and migrants are a main concern for many countries in Europe and Africa included. Conflicts and poor economic context push people out of their homeland to neighboring countries or even further to Europe. Before reaching Europe thousands of refugees from East Africa are welcomed and often remain in Zambia and Uganda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR and governments manage locally the groups of refugees who cross the borders for a safe place to live. Uganda welcomes over 1,300 million refugees from South Soudan, DR Congo, Burundi and Somalia. Zambia currently hosts about 30,000 refugees coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi and Angola.<BR><BR>Both Zambia and Uganda are faced with the challenge of migrant's integration as they are bound to stay for a long time in the UNHCR camps. To best support and attend to the needs of refugees, UNHCR is turning to the distribution of cash based aid. The logic behind this shift to cash is that in-kind aid did not match on the long term the needs of people. Plus, this form of aid does not enable people to start an activity and does not provide the autonomy of choice - about what to eat, how to dress, etc.<BR><BR>However, distributing cash does not come without challenges in remote rural areas. How do you get the cash safely delivered to a camp? How do you ensure a flawless distribution to individuals? Rapidly with the emergence of digital financial services and the penetration of mobile phones in refugee camps, it appeared that digital transfers represent to be a rational choice.<BR><BR>Today UNCDF MM4P and UNHCR are working hand in hand in Zambia and Uganda to digitize the payments of cash based aid. Once cash is transferred to the mobile phone of migrants, they can choose to save it or cash it out. This creates new questions about how and where to cash out and about access to other services such as credit and payment for school fees and health care or even electricity. It also brings in the questions of remittances and how both forms of revenue combined enable migrants to be better off.<BR><BR>These are some of the questions and issues, UNCDF MM4P is working on in Zambia and Uganda. Accessing financial services via accessible and affordable digital means can contribute to better the economic situation of poor people. A recent study in Kenya showed that women living in rural areas with access to digital financial services managed to diversify their sources of income and step out of poverty with better stable incomes. Digital finance and its contribution to the SDGs will be addressed during the next UN General Assembly side meetings. We would like to invite you to discuss with our team the potential challenges and benefits of digital finance to refugees and unbanked people.<BR><BR>Who?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Rohingyas of Myanmar are the victims of &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;, according to an aid charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim was made during a visit to the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, where many of the Muslim minority have fled, by Alistair Dutton of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (Sciaf).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are fleeing the violence in Rakhine State, situated on the west coast of Myanmar, and eyewitness reports have described soldiers and Buddhist leaders carrying out a systematic campaign of murder and setting fire to villages.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusations have been denied by military leaders in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know who's guilty of what but what has happened are crimes against humanity,&quot; said Dutton, who is director of Sciaf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chopping people up, shooting them, burning bodies, torching villages, stealing belongings and driving people out their country - these are crimes against humanity whoever perpetrated them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are an overwhelming number of reports. Everyone spoken to has seen or knew of someone who had family killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if these reports were verified they would quite clearly be crimes against humanity,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sciaf has raised more than &pound;160,000 to help the refugees and despite a a recent repatriation agreement by the Bangladesh and Myanmar governments, refugees continue to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the agreement no details were given on how many Rohingya refugees would be allowed to return home or how soon that might happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 646,000 have risked the dangerous border crossing since the apparent rise in violence, sparked by Rohingya insurgents reportedly attacking police border posts in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton warned that the crisis could last for years. And with the average time a refugee spends displaced at a staggering 17 years - according to an annual report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees - Sciaf and charity partner Caritas Bangladesh are preparing to provide support for the long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're here to help the Rohingya,&quot; said Dutton. &quot;No-one should be under any illusion that the recent Memorandum of Understanding between Myanmar and Bangladesh signals the end of this massive humanitarian disaster. The exile of the Rohingya refugees will almost certainly last for years and we will be here for as long as it takes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month around 30 refugees were arriving daily at Shabrang Harbour at the Bangladesh border before being transported the the Kutupalong camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those who arrived, seven-year-old Noor Karima, escaped with her aunt after watching her mother and father being killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another, Samara Besam, travelled with her three-year-old son and spent a month in hiding after fleeing the violence. The 25-year-old has vowed never to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The military and Buddhist leaders tortured us. Why would we go back to Myanmar when there is no peace?&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They killed us and burned our houses. Why would we go back when there is no shelter?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another resident of the camp, Muhamed Ali, told of his father sacrificing himself to save his family and being &quot;chopped into pieces&quot; by soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 28-year-old said he would prefer to die in Bangladesh than be sent back to his homeland without the creation of a Rohingya state with rights and citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole world should pressure Myanmar to agree these terms. If this doesn't happen we will go anywhere where we can find peace,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Bangladesh government sends us back without any proper settlement, I would say that they should just kill us right here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would be happier to die here than back in Myanmar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">:: Donations to Sciaf's Rohingya emergency appeal can be made online at www.sciaf.org.uk, or by phoning 0141 354 5555.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of a refugee on Manus Island has sparked calls for Australian authorities to intervene after what advocates have described as a preventable tragedy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immigration Department says it is aware of the man's death, which is being investigated by PNG authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man is understood to have taken his own life in the township of Lorengau before he was due to move from detention into the Papua New Guinean community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'More deaths are likely unless the Australian Government acts immediately to bring these people, on both Manus Island and Nauru, to safety in Australia,' David Berger of Doctors for Refugees said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Turnbull government has consistently said refugees being held in offshore detention will never settle in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions are high on Manus Island, with water and electricity cut off to some compounds at the regional processing centre as authorities try to shuffle detainees around ahead of its October closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to this is the release of a leaked transcript of Malcolm Turnbull and Donald Trump discussing a people-swap deal in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister assured the new US President the United States was not obliged to accept a single refugee, needing only to process those held in detention to honour the bargain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull admitted Australia would rather take some of America's most 'unattractive guys' than a Nobel Peace Prize winner who came by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detainees on Manus Island protested against the lack of water and power in the camps, and against the death of their friend, which they said did not have to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dead man is understood to be an Iranian refugee with a history of mental illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He was very sick for [a] long time but Australia did not provide medical treatment for him,' Iranian journalist and Manus Island refugee Behrouz Boochani posted to Twitter.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Webb, from the Human Rights Law Centre, said the man deserved a chance to build a life in freedom and safety when he sought asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he was held in a 'dangerous, unsafe and painful' limbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This man lost his freedom, and then he lost his hope, and now he's lost his life - it is an absolute tragedy,' Mr Webb told reporters in Melbourne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens immigration spokesman Nick McKim laid blame for the man's death at the feet of Immigration Minister Peter Dutton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This man repeatedly sought Australia's help. The Liberals ignored his pleas and now must bear responsibility for what happened,' Senator McKim said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is concerned he was provided inadequate health care and his safety was not paramount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There must be an independent, impartial, prompt and effective investigation into his death,' spokesman Graham Thom said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee is the fifth man held on Manus, and the seventh in total, who has died since Australia's offshore detention regime began in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huge crowds of refugees banded together with signs and chants, with footage and images flooding social media.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group chanted 'bring power back', facing the gates out of the complex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian refugees have become used to the sound of tearing canvas and breaking tent poles. The Lebanese army issues warnings and then their settlements are destroyed and they are told to move on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has happened four times to Ahmed al-Mitab, 32, and his wife and five children. The first incident was prompted by complaints from the neighbours; the second time, the camp was too close to a main road. The third time, it was too close to an air base and the refugees were told they were a security threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth eviction came after the local authority said they did not have a permit and the army arrived ten days later and broke their tents. &quot;I cried,&quot; Mr Mitab said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life has not been easy for Syrian refugees in Lebanon over the past five years. Unnerved by the memory of the civil war, in part set off by clashes with Palestinian refugees, the authorities did not allow the UN to set up permanent facilities for the 1.5 million now living in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems about to get a lot worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an election scheduled next year, politicians from across the sectarian spectrum have begun demanding that refugees - who account for one in four people in Lebanon, the highest per capita influx of displaced Syrians in neighbouring countries - go home, saying they are a drain on the country's limited resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Aoun's parliamentary faction has joined pro-Hezbollah politicians in calling for talks to begin with the Assad regime about resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious leaders who might have been expected to call for understanding have added to the refugees' fears. Cardinal Beshara al-Rai, patriarch of the Maronite Catholics, the largest Christian sect, accused refugees of &quot;taking away the bread of the Lebanese&quot; and plunging them into poverty. &quot;Despite our humanitarian solidarity with these refugees and displaced, the Lebanese call on the president to rectify the course of their certain return,&quot; he said at a Mass attended by Mr Aoun, himself a Maronite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saad Hariri, the prime minister, is a Sunni Muslim like the overwhelming majority of refugees and is insisting that any resettlement should be co-ordinated with the UN, which says it is not currently safe. However, he has authorised military action against militants said to be using the camps as cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one raid at the end of June almost 400 residents of a camp near the town of Arsal were detained. Four died in custody with their bodies showing clear signs of having been beaten, while more than 300 were held for not having the correct paperwork. Another 60 were detained on suspicion of &quot;terrorism&quot;, a charge now being used against anyone suspected of having fought for anti-regime factions in Syria, including westernbacked groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who is ruling this country?&quot; asked Diala Chehade, a lawyer for three of the dead men. She said that Lebanon's military intelligence department was acting as a law unto itself in harassing the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abu Walid, 42, a father of four who lives in a legal camp near Mr Mitab's, was offered the chance to move to Britain under a resettlement programme. On the day he was supposed to fly he backed out, persuaded by his mother to stay close to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he fears the next &quot;choice&quot; he will be offered is to return home to the Yarmouk suburb of Damascus, once a Palestinian refugee camp but now a shelled wreck. &quot;You have seen the pictures,&quot; Abu Walid said. &quot;I don't even know if my house is standing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawan Batha, 28, the doctor at Abu Walid's camp, was offered a place at a German university to complete her training in gastroenterology but was told she could not bring her twomonth-old baby so she declined. She says she is too afraid to return to Syria. Her father was arrested at the border and held for five months, she said. Her husband's four brothers were seized in a night-time raid on their home four years ago. Three were released after five months of torture. The fourth has not been seen since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One senior aid worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said he believed there would be no formal change in policy, and that much of the anti-immigrant talk was pre-election rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, some studies suggest that the refugees have brought new spending power to the Lebanese economy. Even in the camps, this is true; Mr Mitab and other residents pay the landowners $500 a year each in rent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time his tent was torn down, he said, his family slept under the stars. His home town, Saraqeb, in Idlib province, is now under the control of a jihadist group but he said he regretted having left. &quot;If I had known this would have happened I would have stayed there to die,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he went back now he would be conscripted into the army, he said. So the day after his tent was torn down for the fourth time he went into town, bought more canvas and set it up again. The next time the soldiers came, he said, he would go quietly. &quot;I will just go wherever they tell me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A VOLUNTEER from Swindon who travelled to Calais last weekend has said she finds it impossible to describe the despair and suffering among the refugees she met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kate Linnegar, from Rodbourne, was among a contingent of 33 who made the trip along with a van loaded with much-needed supplies. Their support mission was organised by the Oxfordshire Refugee Solidarity group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the formal 'jungle' camp was dismantled with its occupants evicted and moved on last year, informal groupings of refugees are still arriving all the time, seeking help and shelter before ultimately trying to reach the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kate and her fellow volunteers spent their weekend supporting a number of the organisations who are trying to fill the support gap left since the destruction of the jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the first day, they worked in the Refugee Community Kitchen where more than 2,000 meals are distributed to refugees each day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were people from all over the world chopping, cooking, washing up and bopping to the loud music playing as we worked,&quot; said Kate. &quot;It was fascinating to hear why and how people had ended up volunteering here. A great feeling of camaraderie and love was in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went out on the Calais lunch time distribution and was handing out garlic bread. It was devastating to look into the eyes of fellow human beings whilst only being able to give them the most basic aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the refugees smiled and thanked us, trying to speak some English. I have never felt so inadequate. Some of the men looked empty and devoid of all emotion; shell shocked and utterly depressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to cry but these people weren't crying. Some of them made jokes with us. They played football after lunch to keep warm and stave off the boredom. The resilience of human beings astounds me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kate described the freezing temperatures that are set to plummet still further as we edge further into winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The volunteers were struggling to keep warm even with thermals, many layers of clothes, thick winter coats, gloves, hats and scarves,&quot; she said. &quot;I couldn't imagine how hard it must be for the refugees who were going to be sleeping out all night in that with no shelter and inadequate clothing. We had the luxury of a warm hostel, hot showers and a hot meal that evening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Sunday, some of the volunteers worked in the Care 4 Calais warehouse sorting out clothes, preparing blankets and food packs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They travelled to nearby Dunkirk where refugees are also gathering, including some families with young children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were grateful for the blankets but every one of them asked for a sleeping bag and we didn't have any,&quot; recalled Kate. &quot;It was devastating not having what they needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were told that the stuff in the warehouse was only enough to last two more weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to supplies, volunteers are also dwindling. Kate fears that many people mistakenly believe there are no longer any refugees in need in Calais since the jungle was dismantled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The refugees have not one single bit of shelter, no tents or tarpaulins. They are sleeping out in the open in the scrub land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The French government do not want them to establish another camp. Every day the police chase them away, taking their possessions or pepper spraying the bedding making it impossible to sleep in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kate was adamant that the story of the people she met has to be told - not to seek praise for her efforts, but to raise awareness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not about me,&quot; she said. &quot;It's about these broken and abandoned human beings. About people who have been forced to flee persecution and wars. About people who have walked for months and months across Europe being beaten and brutalised all the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot adequately express my devastation at witnessing these things or my admiration of these resilient and brave people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">823 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ability to speak or communicate in the language of a country may be the single most important skill for any person hoping to integrate fully in that country and culture. If you cannot understand the common language, what hope is there for somebody to feel at home, let alone to contribute to society in a successful and mutually productive way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's upcoming integration strategy is, therefore, an opportunity to invest in Britain's future and prevent communities becoming alienated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first year as home secretary Theresa May, our prime minister, said: &quot;We know that speaking English is key to integration&quot; - a view supported across the political spectrum with cross-party support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But much more needs to be done for English for speakers of other languages (ESOL). Many newcomers to Britain, including refugees, face huge barriers to learning and integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent reports on integration, from the Casey Review commissioned by David Cameron when he was prime minister to the recent report by Chukka Umunna's APPG on social integration, all make a strong case for investing in English language lessons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the Home Office committed &pound;10 million to English lessons for Syrian refugees as part of the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS). This is already making a huge difference to resettled Syrians, but all refugees in the UK, regardless of their nationality or means of arrival in Britain, should have the same access to the minimum eight hours of lessons a week that this extra investment will provide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there is an opportunity for this government, with its response to the Casey Review and plans for a new integration strategy due in the coming weeks, to grab the bull by the horns and bring together our diverse communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having served in cabinet we know tough funding decisions need to be made. But we also know that investment in English language lessons is vital to enable people to work, start businesses and volunteer, for friendships and understanding to develop between neighbours and people of different cultures, and to prevent communities becoming isolated and alienated. It is an investment in Britain's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To mark its partnership with the Jo Cox Loneliness Commission, the charity Refugee Action polled providers of ESOL courses and found that the majority were concerned that they were not able to provide enough classes to meet learners' needs. Refugees can wait up to three years to start English classes, the research shows, with one provider commenting that &quot;current provision is not fit for purpose&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings on women learners are particularly concerning, with 77 per cent of ESOL providers unable to provide childcare, or enough to meet demand. This leaves women particularly isolated and without a voice of their own. Dame Louise Casey rightly highlights the need to address the issue of vulnerable women trapped at home and unable to integrate because they can't speak English, as a priority in her report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some inspiring community projects stepping in to reduce isolation among refugee women and help them with their English. But this alone cannot be a substitute for formal, accredited ESOL lessons, which are needed for entry into employment and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're looking forward to a lively discussion on these issues in a Westminster Hall debate on English language teaching for refugees later today. This is a cross-government issue and it needs a cross-government response. We know this government is up to the task of seizing this opportunity to do more to promote integration than any before it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll also be joining Refugee Action and the Jo Cox Loneliness Commission at an event in parliament tomorrow morning, which will bring together refugees and MPs to discuss how to address loneliness and isolation, and the need to enable all refugees in Britain to learn English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the refugees who will be speaking is Amal, who was studying to be a lawyer before she was forced to flee civil war in Sudan. She has struggled to access the English lessons she needs to get into a university here and runs a voluntary support group for Sudanese women. Amal says many of the 20 women she supports have been unable to start learning English due to long waiting lists and a lack of childcare support. They meet to socialise and practice conversational English, but she is aware that they are making little contact with the rest of the community and their English neighbours despite their strong wish to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot continue to allow the valuable skills and experiences of tens of thousands of refugees to go to waste as they languish on long waiting lists for English lessons. Unlocking their enormous potential will boost our economy and help bring together communities in post-Brexit Britain.Nicky Morgan is chair of the treasury select committee and former education secretary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extra Papua New Guinean police and the notorious mobile squad will be brought in to Manus Island ahead of next week's forced closure of the immigration detention centre, with authorities warning people's safety is &quot;not to be taken for granted&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increased security presence comes as Australia's plan to close the centre faces potential violent resistance from the island's community as well as a court challenge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police commissioner, Gary Baki, said the extra units would be made available to assist the immigration department in relocating the more than 700 men to the purpose-built alternative accommodation in the nearby town of Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Extra manpower is on standby to be deployed to Manus Island to assist the local police in addition to the two Mobile Squad now on the island,&quot; the PNG police force said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Peter Dutton to face new class action alleging unlawful detention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The safety of both the refugees and government workers plus staff of leading agencies is not to be taken for granted given the tension that is now being expressed by the locals on Manus Island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elaine Pearson, Australian director of Human Rights Watch, said Baki's statement acknowledged the escalating tension, and forcibly removing refugees and asylum seekers now would &quot;clearly expose them to greater danger&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;PNG police should do their job and investigate assaults against refugees rather than helping transfer refugees to a place where they will be even more vulnerable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre is slated for closure next Tuesday. Officials have already told the men still living there that water and electricity will be shut off, and access to food and water stopped on Sunday. The men have been told they will be given &quot;food packs&quot; to last two days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees and asylum seekers still inside the Manus detention centre have said they will refuse to leave, even when the PNG military seek to take over the compound. They say they are unsafe in the Manus community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 31 October closure of the detention centre - sparked by a PNG supreme court decision 18 months ago that its operation was &quot;illegal and unconstitutional&quot; - faces significant opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Ben Lomai, who in a previous supreme court challenge has represented those detained on Manus, has said he will seek orders from the court that food and water should be provided to those in the centre beyond 31 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's anything, food and water should be maintained because that's their constitutional right,&quot; he told Radio New Zealand. &quot;So you can't deny them food and water. So if they are allowed to stay there then those are the two services they can be entitled to. Other things can be subject to further negotiation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he would also seek orders guaranteeing the men's safety if and when they are moved to Lorengau, and a requirement that refugees are offered resettlement in a third country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus Island governor, Charlie Benjamin, said the province's reputation had been damaged by the constant scandals attached to the detention centre. Six men have died while being held on the island, and a riot in 2014, when the detention centre was stormed by police and outsiders, saw asylum seekers shot, beaten and attacked with machetes. One was killed by guards and more than 70 seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin told the Post-Courier Australia should compensate Manus with a significant infrastructure project, such as a hospital, before the centre is shut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  After years in dangerous limbo the men on Manus must be brought to safety | Georgie Bright</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Australian government and the PNG government, they more or less used us and they didn't help us. We appreciate what little they helped us with, but looking at the enormity of the project now, the type of help we are getting, is that enough to compensate our province?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe to them it is enough, but to all of us it is not enough, especially now, throughout the world, thanks to the outside media, everybody now knows that Manus is the worst province in the whole of PNG because we allegedly did not look after these asylum [seekers] or refugees,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A town meeting held in Ward 1 of Lorengau township this week heard from a number of Manusians who have vowed to oppose the resettlement of refugees in their community. A petition being circulated in Lorengau calls on the Australian government to take the men to Australia while third countries are found for their resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civic leaders have been warning for months that the imposition of more than 700 single men within the conservative, tight-knit and familial community of Lorengau will prove disastrous. Many of the refugees and asylum seekers are suffering from acute physical and mental health problems, and require significant care. Some refugees have been given a month's worth of tablets and other medications with the centre closing down, but no further medical guidance or assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some at the meeting, Manus sources told the Guardian, threatened to blockade and vandalise the new refugee and asylum seeker accommodation being built, and violence against those building it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Manus MP Ronnie Knight, who has been an outspoken critic of Australia's imposition of the detention centre on Manus, said forcibly closing the centre and abandoning refugees on the island would be dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia, PNG and UNHCR should get their shit together and find a solution for both my people and refugees before any more needless deaths occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I foresee drunk local youths going too far. I foresee more sexual assaults on locals which will inflame the situation and [the] refugees [are] sitting ducks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the deadline fell for 30,500 asylum seekers living in Australia to lodge their applications for asylum. Immigration minister Peter Dutton announced the deadline in May this year, alongside the condition that anyone who didn't meet the deadline would be automatically considered to have abandoned their claim to asylum and subject to deportation. The government's FAQ for people affected by the deadline put it bluntly: &quot;If you do not lodge, you are not an asylum seeker and must return home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IMAs in Aust have a month left to apply for a TPV or SHEV. Those who don't will be deemed not to require protection https://t.co/ZBZJ3ywxim - Peter Dutton (@PeterDutton_MP) September 1, 2017</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The imposition of a non-negotiable, non-discretionary and blanket deadline to a group of asylum seekers - where the failure to meet the deadline extinguishes any form of claim - is an exceptionally unfair, arbitrary and dangerous measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  500 asylum seekers face deportation for missing protection deadline</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affected asylum seekers have been subject, since at least 2012, to rule by a form of executive decree. Their experiences could amount to a case study into what the effects of unfettered, out of control, discretionary government power look like. The surprise announcement of this deadline was no exception to this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadline itself was a discriminatory measure, applying only to asylum-seekers who arrived by boat between August 2012 and January 2014 - the so-called &quot;legacy caseload.&quot; When announced, around 7,500 applicants had not yet lodged their applications. Dutton declared these people to be &quot;fake refugees&quot; costing Australian tax payers &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars a year.&quot; Remarkably, with the assistance of refugee advocacy organisations, many people have managed to submit their applications for asylum. Yet as of last week, refugee organisations reported that at least 500-600 people are yet to lodge their claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;lodge or leave&quot; terms of the deadline, such that those falling foul of it may be deported without any determination of their protection claim, breaches the most fundamental obligation owed by Australia under international refugee law: the prohibition on sending people back to places where they may face persecution otherwise known as the norm of non-refoulement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire refugee convention turns on respect for this principle. Successive Labor and Liberal governments have engaged in a permanent form of doublespeak when it comes to their compliance with it. They have implemented offshore detention policies that have been described by the UN as amounting to torture to deter potential asylum seekers and punish those who travel to Australia by boat. They have defended a policy of &quot; enhanced screening &quot; that allows predominantly Sri Lankan asylum seekers to be repatriated after answering as few as three questions. Yet they have implemented these measures that violate the convention's spirit and text while declaring full compliance with the black letter of international refugee law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If any asylum seeker who has been unable to meet the deadline is returned without an assessment of their case, even the thinnest, most dubious and calculated claim of compliance with international refugee law can no longer stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR has repeatedly set out that &quot;fair and efficient [status determination] procedures are an essential element in the full and inclusive application of the [Refugee] Convention.&quot; Over the last 40 years, more than 80% of people arriving to Australia by boat have been found to be refugees. In certain years, 100% of Afghani boat arrivals, who comprise about 13% of the &quot;legacy caseload&quot;, have been granted protection. The &quot;legacy caseload&quot; also includes approximately 2,500 stateless people, many of whom are Rohingya fleeing persecution described as &quot; textbook ethnic cleansing &quot; in Myanmar. Knowing this, it is inevitable that some asylum seekers will be recklessly returned to situations of harm if the deadline is enforced against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the government's attempts to justify the deadline has included a claim that these asylum seekers have &quot; failed or refused &quot; to apply for asylum despite having had &quot;significant opportunity&quot; to do so. But these accusations leave out the critical fact that for between 2012 and 2015, the affected asylum seekers were prohibited by law from filing an application for protection under any circumstances. For some, this resulted in waiting nearly five years to apply for asylum. As the Refugee Council of Australia has documented, the government only began allowing some asylum seekers to lodge their claim in mid-2015, with the majority of asylum seekers only becoming eligible to lodge their claims towards the end of 2016. That is, mere months before the deadline was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Dutton should learn to live with lawyers helping in matters of life and death | Claire Higgins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, the prolonged legal uncertainty faced by the &quot;legacy caseload&quot; has been shown to contribute to increased mental deterioration and self-harm for those affected. As well, the enforcement of the deadline will continue a trend recently identified by Claire Higgins as &quot; deportation by destitution &quot;, since the government has threatened to immediately deny both income support and rental assistance to those who do not meet the deadline whilst compelling them to make arrangements to depart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unfairness of this deadline hasn't ended on 1 October. Given the cascading harms caused by the policy, there are serious questions about whether the refugee determination process that follows will be fair and produce legally correct outcomes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanya Jackson-Vaughan, executive director of the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, noted recently that refugee organisations providing legal advice to these asylum seekers hold serious concerns about their capacity to support clients in the next phase of the assessment process. They are calling for urgent funding to provide legal assistance for members of the &quot;legacy caseload&quot;. And as with each unforeseen executive announcement, the refugees affected must now wait to see exactly how this latest incarnation of policy-on-the-run will be enforced against them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">810 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Adrian Edwards -- to whom quoted text may be attributed -- at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva:<BR><BR>UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is increasingly concerned by escalating displacement we are seeing in several key regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since 2015 the number of people displaced internally has more than doubled and now stands at 3.9 million people -- some 428,000 of these having been displaced in the past three months alone. Over the past year, some 100,000 Congolese have fled to neighbouring countries as refugees. With widespread militia activities, and unrest and violence fueled by ethnic and political conflict affecting many areas, the risk of further displacement is high. The challenges of getting aid to people in need are growing fast.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanganyika province<BR><BR>In the eastern province of Tanganyika, where some 584,000 people are internally displaced, intercommunal conflict between the Twa and Luba groups spilled into neighboring Haut-Katanga province earlier this year. Clashes with the army continue and there is wide prevalence of armed militia. Scores of civilians have been forced to flee, and there have been reports of murders, looting and extortion, and torture or other inhumane treatment. With people finding it difficult to sustain their livelihoods, more are becoming dependent on aid.<BR><BR>Refugees crossing from DRC into neighbouring Zambia are hosted temporarily at the Kenani transit center, close to the border. Over 5,400 people are currently staying at the center, receiving assistance from the authorities, UNHCR and partners. As the rainy season has started, it is becoming urgently important to beef up public health, sanitation and water supplies to prevent diseases. Psychosocial support, as well as care for people with specific needs -- some 27 per cent of the refugee population -- is also urgently required.<BR><BR>North and South Kivu provinces<BR><BR>Further north in the east of DRC, violence involving mostly local armed groups is also plaguing North and South Kivu provinces. In North Kivu alone, over one million people are displaced. In South Kivu, where 545,000 people are internally displaced, the security situation further deteriorated in September as conflicts escalated between militias and the armed forces in the territories of Fizi and Uvira. Fear is widespread, including among the 30,000 Burundian refugees hosted at Lusenda camp in Fizi.<BR><BR>Congolese from North Kivu have mainly been fleeing to Uganda, and those from South Kivu to Tanzania - usually transiting through Burundi to escape attacks in their villages. Currently, Uganda hosts the largest number of DRC refugees, over 236,500 people, mostly in the south-west. In Tanzania, there were 76,890 DRC refugees as of the end of September.<BR><BR>The Kasai region<BR><BR>Meanwhile, in the Kasai region in central-southern DRC, displaced people and refugees who fled the violence that started over a year ago have begun to return. As of 23 October, over 710,000 people had gone back. Many are finding their property in ruins and family members killed. At present the situation in the Kasai region is far from stable and humanitarian access has only just become possible in many areas.<BR><BR>In total, over 762,000 people are displaced in the Kasai region. In Angola's Lunda Norte province an additional 27,555 Congolese who have fled the Kasai conflict are being assisted by UNHCR and partners.<BR><BR>UNHCR is coordinating protection activities for the displaced from the Kasai conflict, returnees and other vulnerable civilians. We have also distributed basic relief items and are preparing additional support, particularly for the communities where returns take place.<BR><BR>In light of the situations in these three regions, UNHCR and partners have recently upgraded the situation in Democratic Republic of the Congo to level 3 -- the highest level of emergency. UNHCR, as part of this response, will be fulfilling its responsibilities focusing on protection and assistance of the displaced populations, including through leadership of the Protection cluster.<BR><BR>Refugees<BR><BR>In all, there are today some 621,711 refugees from the DRC in more than eleven African countries. And funding is urgently needed. Of some US$ 236.2 million required for the needs of refugees, IDPs and other people of concern in the DRC, only US$ 49.7 million has been received so far - a fifth of the amount required.<BR><BR>At the same time, the number of refugees from neighboring countries seeking refuge inside Democratic Republic of the Congo has grown by a third since early 2016 and now stands at 526,000 people. We continue to see new arrivals from Burundi, the Central African Republic and South Sudan.<BR><BR>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT is&nbsp;arguably the world's most exclusive lottery in which the names of Members of the UK Parliament who want it are entered into a ballot that sees 20 names drawn out with usually only the first seven then able to present a Private Member's Bill to the House of Commons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest ballot, Western Isles SNP MP Angus MacNeil was the seventh name to be drawn out, and later today he will announce that he is going to use his Bill to fight for the rights of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Refugee Family Reunion Bill will address several issues that have split families. It will give refugee children the right to be reunited with their parents - under current reunion rules children cannot sponsor their parents to come to the UK, leaving them alone here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill will also expand the definition of family member as currently only spouses and children under the age of 18 are allowed to join their family in the UK, and it will also reintroduce legal aid for refugee family applications, which stopped in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private Member's Bills can change the law of the land - the abolition of capital punishment and the legalisation of abortion began as such bills - but they do usually require backing from the government of the day. Governments tends to favour bills put forward by its own party members, and only one Labour member and one Liberal Democrat MP saw their bills become law under David Cameron's coalition and Tory governments compared to 32 successful Conservative bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacNeil will present his Private Members Bill in the House of Commons next Wednesday, 19 July. Though it has little chance of reaching the Statute Book unless the Conservative and Democratic Unionist parties find a magic compassion tree, the Bill will allow MacNeil to publicise the plight of refugee families with the first debate expected in early 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacNeil said the plight of refugees is an issue which many constituents have got in touch with him about in recent months. In the coming months he says he will put pressure on the Government to support this piece of legislation which will offer families a chance to be reunited and to escape danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has already secured support from the Refugee Council, UNHCR the UN Refugee Agency, Amnesty International, the British Red Cross and Oxfam GB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacNeil said: &quot;It is a great honour to be drawn in the Private Members Bill ballot. I am glad to have been given the opportunity to help develop the debate. I think the most important area for me to develop a debate is on the humanitarian side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should not be only glad that they are alive but do everything in our power to help them to thrive. We see from many other communities of refugees around the world, be it Vietnamese in Canada, when people are given a chance they usually thrive and enrich their lives, enrich the community life and enrich the national life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all have a stake in this economically and we certainly have a stake in this morally and from a humanitarian perspective. Hopefully my bill will change the law to help people and at the very least it should prick consciousness to change bureaucracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">764 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a record number of asylum seekers and refugees arrived in Germany two years ago, Carmen Bachmann was one of many in the country who felt compelled to help the newcomers settle in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She did not rush down to greet them with welcome signs or pledge to volunteer at refugee camps. Instead Bachmann, 41, a Leipzig University professor, turned into something of a matchmaker. She created a website, Chance for Science, to connect refugee academics with German counterparts across a broad range of disciplines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site uses the template of a dating service and allows users to register as a refugee academic or a German professor or researcher, stating their location and field of study, so people can be matched together with others doing similar work. There are now 720 registered users, including 224 refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The links made via the website could lead to a job, although Bachmann said that was not the main aim. &quot;The primary thinking is to encourage work collaboration, the sharing of ideas or to help refugee scientists gain access to the latest research. Alongside it, we have also been running educational workshops for the past year with government funding. They help newcomers understand how the German academic system works,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also want to make people feel like they are staying in touch with the academic world. Being an academic is part of their identity and when refugees come here they lose that. It is important for them to be in an environment where they can be a specialist again and people recognise them as such. People can come together and share ideas, discuss and create networks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the project, Bachmann is now working with G&uuml;nay Karli, 45, a computer scientist who specialises in artificial intelligence. He worked at Fatih University in Turkey before it was one of several institutions closed down by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, over alleged links to the exiled cleric Fethullah G&uuml;len and an  attempted political coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karli, who arrived in Germany from Bosnia three months ago, said: &quot;I was surprised to hear about the project because it is so selfless ... This project is important for refugees because we do not have anything related to our academic fields or system. We don't know anyone who knows how things work and we have a desire to continue our research, learn and to share ideas.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bachmann and Karli are working together on taxation. One aspect they are looking at is whether it is possible to predict the future performance of a company and its key performance indicator (KPI) by analysing social media. Karli is helping with data analysis and using computer software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Karli waits to hear the result of his asylum application, he is happy to continue doing academic work. Although he cannot take paid employment, everything he does will be useful for his portfolio of work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a refugee but this is only a small part of who I am. I am also still an academic,&quot; he said. &quot;No matter what situation I find myself in I have to continue with my research still. We cannot stop our brains from working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bachmann and her small team recently held a conference, Academics on the Flight, where eight refugees spoke on stage about their work and others presented posters. &quot;Lots of the refugees have no affiliations any more and Chance for Science is an intermediate affiliation, so people feel they can belong to something, even if their home university does not exist any more,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bachmann got a year's worth of money from the government to run the workshops and conference but it runs out in December. &quot;I would like more funding as it has become a second full-time job for me ... I need support because there is lots of potential in this idea and it is growing fast. It could also work for other professions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the biggest challenge of the project had been overcoming the bureaucracy of the German system. &quot;I did not ask permission from anyone to set up the website, just the president of the university, because it would have taken too long to do it officially. These are people who would have nothing to do and I wanted to start it quickly.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her inspiration came from a chance meeting with an academic at a refugee camp. &quot;I met a man and all he had with him was his diploma. He was so happy someone was paying attention to it because, understandably, the volunteers there were just making sure everyone had shelter and food. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From that moment it became very personal for me and it helped me realise what being an academic is. I have learned just as much from this process as those I have been helping.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 17km out from Berlin's central Alexanderplatzand with few public transport connections, Pankow 1 has seen the construction of four temporary accommodation centres for refugees in the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are three such centres in Buch alone, each with a capacity to host about 450 people, and two are within a few hundred metres of each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heini Schulz, who lives in a tower blockopposite one of the temporary structures for refugees, is a former voter for Ms Merkel's conservative CDU party but is now considering voting for the AfD.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anna Buhl, also a resident of one of the tower blocks, agrees the area has received too many refugees: &quot;There is a lot of noise here, children living in the camp are heard playing and screaming until 11pm - my children would have been in bed by then. It's not true to say that a majority of people are happy with this policy,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Buchholz, who campaigned in the area for the AfD, was quick to tell Ms Buhl that documents from the German Senate, also seen by </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, statethe refugee shelter cost taxpayers nearly (EURO)19m (&pound;16.8m).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Too much money has been spent on these camps,&quot; he said.&quot;To have an apartment in Berlin, people work and pay for it and can't even afford living in such nice a place. This money should be spent to benefit the people earning it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AfD's lurch to the right and adoption of an anti-immigrant stance have shifted the party's support base from one of disgruntled economists to voters who feel they have been left behind by traditional parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Timm Westmark, of North Rhine-Westphalia, a traditional left-wing stronghold in the north-west of the country, immigration is also the fundamental reason why he supports the AfD. The 23-year-old law student also teaches German in refugee centres.</SPAN></P>

People who vote for the [centre-left] SPD and have never seen what actually happens here say it's all OK, they are all nice people.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while some AfD voters may remain quiet before Sunday's election when Germans voters will head to the polls, a feeling of excitement has spread through the party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expected to win up to 12 per cent of the votes according to polls, there is little doubt the AfD's presence in parliament will shake up the consensus politics of the past four years. With Angela Merkel poised to win a fourth term in office and the centre-left again a possible coalition partner, the AfD could become the government's main opposition party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Dutton agreed to allow the United Nations to put cases for especially vulnerable refugees held in offshore detention camps to be resettled in Australia, but then reneged on the understanding, a senior UN official has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volker T&uuml;rk, the assistant high commissioner for protection within the UN's refugee agency, told the ABC's 7.30 program the immigration minister agreed in a meeting last year that the UNHCR could present &quot;compelling humanitarian cases with strong family links in Australia&quot; for resettlement in Australia without fanfare or public acknowledgement of any exception to government policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR has identified 36 people - of the 2,000 people held offshore - it wanted to present for resettlement in Australia. Those refugees have spouses, children or parents living in Australia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Offshore detention cost taxpayers $5bn in four years - and asylum seekers remain in limbo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T&uuml;rk met Dutton in November last year, as the UNHCR considered what role, if any, it would play in Australia's deal to resettle refugees held on its offshore islands in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that meeting, T&uuml;rk said: &quot;There was no doubt in our mind - and this is what we put forward to the minister at the time - that we would present to him cases that are compelling humanitarian cases with close family links to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were hoping that, indeed, Australia would consider them favourably within the discretion that the minister has at his disposal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T&uuml;rk said there was no agreement to the resettlement of specific refugees, &quot;because we hadn't presented cases yet&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he [Dutton] did agree that we would be able to present such cases and, in subsequent meetings with the department, it was very important for us to ensure precisely that the verification of close family links was ascertained by our officers so that we could present such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, we went into this agreement on the understanding that Australia would be part of the solution for a handful of compelling humanitarian cases with strong family links in Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday the UN's most senior refugee agency official, the high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi, issued an extraordinary statement, saying Australia had failed to honour a &quot;clear agreement&quot; with the UN on family reunification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grandi said offshore processing caused &quot;extensive, avoidable suffering&quot;, deliberately split families and was contrary to &quot;common decency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  UN official says Australia responsible for 'inhuman' treatment of asylum seekers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a fundamental contradiction in saving people at sea, only to mistreat and neglect them on land,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suggestion of an agreement for Australian resettlement runs contrary to all the government's public pronouncements on the refugees it has sent to its offshore detention centres. Publicly the government has unflinchingly maintained, over years, that no one sent to Manus or Nauru would ever be resettled in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the UNHCR took notice of the vociferous public debate around asylum in Australia and was seeking to give the government the opportunity to quietly resettle those compelling cases in Australia without public fanfare or acknowledgement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to questions on Grandi's statement, a spokeswoman for Dutton directed the Guardian to a Sunday television interview where the minister was asked whether there was any contingency under which the government might allow any refugees held offshore to come to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. People will not be coming to Australia,&quot; Dutton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the government is facing renewed and concerted pressure to end offshore processing for a second time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International's refugee coordinator, Dr Graham Thom, said the issue of split families had been of preeminent concern since the announcement of the US deal in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thom said the UNHCR's allegation that the Australian government was choosing to deliberately separate family members permanently was yet another measure designed to punish people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This latest decision by the Australian government speaks volumes on the extreme measures of cruelty it is willing to mete out on people who came here seeking protection and safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Refugee Council of Australia said the government had no plan to meet its legal obligations for resettling refugees, beyond foisting its responsibilities on to other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is paying PNG and Nauru to detain people on its behalf and forcing asylum seekers back to Indonesia or to punishment in countries of origin, while quietly begging other countries to resettle the many people found to be refugees,&quot; the council chief executive, Paul Power, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  UNHCR says Australia must end offshore detention and stop dividing families</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Law Centre's Daniel Webb said it appeared the government had deliberately misled the UN, and accused the government of abandoning basic decency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Permanently ripping apart families is fundamentally wrong. Children deserve to be with their parents. Families forced to flee persecution deserve to build a future in safety together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US resettlement deal - touted by both the government and opposition as the resolution of Australia's offshore regime - remains uncertain. No one has been resettled under the plan and US officials recently left the offshore islands once the country hit its cap for accepting refugees for this year. The quota resets in October.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have lost a son, a brother, a cousin and a wonderful friend,' the man's cousin told&nbsp; Tamil Refugee Council.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'After all the trauma he was put through, the Australian government now wants to put his grieving family through more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Why would they do this to us? They have taken our dear Rajeev from us - is this not enough? But now they demand a fortune as well.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tamil Refugee Council said the 32-year-old had been 'threatened by the Sri Lankan military', was 'denied asylum in Australia' and found out his 'father had cancer' two months ago which 'finally took its toll'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rajendran's death is reportedly the second suicide on Manus Island in the past two months and is the sixth fatality in four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Manus Island MP Ron Knight said the magistrate on the island will be conducting a coroner's investigation over coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It seems like a suicide but it's not confirmed yet,' Mr Knight told AAP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said locals had become increasingly frustrated with the problems that have come with hosting the immigration detention centre, which is slated for closure at the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's given the island a bad name, it's given the people a bad name, when people are being looked after by our government and the Australian government have to resort to something like this to prove a point, it means that something is terribly wrong with the whole system,' Mr Knight said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said the man had been sent to the hospital three days earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens senator Nick McKim said the case was 'catastrophic neglect' from Immigration Minister Peter Dutton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This man had suffered for years in a system that Australia's Labor and Liberal parties deliberately designed and operated to cause mental harm,' he said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of Iranian refugee Hamed Shamshiripour was found near refugee accommodation in early August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death comes as more than 50 refugees last week left Manus Island and Nauru for a new life in the U.S.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More are expected to follow in coming months.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has contradicted claims from Peter Dutton that refugees bound for the US under a resettlement deal are &quot;economic refugees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the ABC's Insiders program on Sunday, Bishop said the people leaving Australia's offshore detention centres for resettlement in the US were genuine refugees, in contradiction of the immigration minister's tirade on Thursday in which he claimed they were not fleeing war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US agreed to take a number of refugees and that means that they have been assessed by the UN high commissioner for refugees and found to be genuine refugees,&quot; Bishop said. &quot;That group is then assessed by the United States and they have very stringent vetting processes, as we know.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  500 asylum seekers face deportation for missing protection deadline</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton had claimed many of those people who Australia had sent to offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru had not come from war-ravaged areas but were instead seeking economic advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International labelled the comments extremely irresponsible, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the refugee convention and imperilling the resettlement of refugees in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the fact Dutton's comments were directed at the first group of 54 people to go the US, Bishop said she believed Dutton was &quot;referring to those who have been found not to be owed protection&quot;, including a &quot;significant number from Iran&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They should go home,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the comments had damaged the US deal, Bishop said that Australia was focused on helping the US vet &quot;as many people as we hope that they will&quot; for resettlement and continuing to look for other resettlement options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While stopping short of describing the situation in Rakhine state in Myanmar as ethnic cleansing, Bishop said the Australian government was &quot;deeply disturbed by what's going on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop said that 500,000 Rohingya had been displaced from Rakhine state and were seeking sanctuary in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I made it clear to the Myanmar national security adviser when I saw him at the United Nations that this security operation that is going on in Rakhine state between the Myanmar army and a Rohingya army must stop,&quot; she said. &quot;Humanitarian support must be allowed in and that the Rohingya must be allowed to return to Rakhine state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have been assessed by the UN high commissioner for refugees and found to be genuine refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Julie Bishop    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the fact US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has said the Burmese government appears to be engaged in a &quot;brutal sustained campaign&quot; of ethnic-cleansing, Australia has continued to promise thousands of dollars to Rohingya refugees in Australian-run detention centres who agree to return to Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN secretary general, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, and Malaysia's top counter-terrorism official have warned that the humanitarian crisis is a breeding ground for terrorist radicalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the threat of radicalisation, Bishop said that Australia was &quot;deeply concerned that the persecution of a significant group of Muslim Rohingyas will be used by Isis and other terrorist groups as part of their narrative to take up arms and to fight against the west&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop said that Australia supported an independent UN investigation and noted Aung San Suu Kyi had confirmed UN representatives and international diplomats, including Australia's ambassador, would be invited to visit Rakhine state on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop also indicated that the Australian government believed the strong involvement of China in backing new sanctions on North Korea seems to have changed the calculations for the rogue regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said it was exploring whether North Korea was interested in dialogue and revealed it had multiple direct channels of communication with Pyongyang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop confirmed Tillerson had told her he had been &quot;back channelling&quot; North Korea - or sending messages via non-conventional routes - in a bid to get them to the negotiating table and take some of the heat out of the official conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop said that the former US president Barack Obama's policy of &quot;strategic patience&quot; towards North Korea had failed but that China had &quot;recalculated the risk&quot; of leaving North Korea as an issue for the US after Donald Trump had &quot;upped the ante in terms of rhetoric&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Peter Dutton launches extraordinary attack on 'economic refugees' sent to US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that China's involvement is a positive,&quot; she said. &quot;They are playing a pretty active role and I think it's just changed the calculation in the minds of the North Koreans as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop defended her attendance at the AFL grand final after Fairfax media reported she had attended at taxpayer expense for the fourth consecutive year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop said she did not travel to Melbourne for the AFL and all of the travel was within parliamentary entitlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted the AFL is a &quot;significant international event&quot; and she works with the AFL as part of Australia's aid program in Pacific Island nations. &quot;I was invited in my official capacity as a partner of the AFL and I was pleased to attend.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trump administration can strictly enforce its ban on refugees, the US Supreme Court has ruled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the court is leaving in place a weakened travel ban that includes grandparents among relatives who can help visitors from six mostly Muslim countries get into the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justices acted on Wednesday on the administration's appeal against a federal judge's ruling last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US District Judge Derrick Watson ordered the government to allow in refugees formally working with a resettlement agency in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also vastly expanded the family relations that refugees and visitors can use to get into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high court blocked his order as it applies to refugees for now, but not the expanded list of relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justices said the federal appeals court in San Francisco should now consider the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear how quickly that will happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, up to 24,000 refugees who have already been assigned to a charity or religious organisation in the US will not be able to use that connection to get into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This ruling jeopardises the safety of thousands of people across the world including vulnerable families fleeing war and violence,&quot; said Naureen Shah, Amnesty International USA's senior director of campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That part of the court's ruling was a victory for President Donald Trump, who rolled out a first ban on travellers and refugees after just a week in office, prompting a legal fight that has raged ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Supreme Court also denied the administration's request to clarify its ruling last month that allowed the administration to partially reinstate a 90-day ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on refugees from anywhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court's ruling exempted a large swath of refugees and travellers with a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot; with a person or an entity in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justices did not define those relationships but said they could include a close relative, a job offer or admission to a college or university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Watson's order added grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins to a list that already included a parent, spouse, fiance, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expanded list of relatives remains in effect, and the State Department already has instructed diplomats to use the broader list when considering visa applicants from the six countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said the court's order &quot;confirms we were right to say that the Trump administration over-reached in trying to unilaterally keep families apart from each other&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas would have blocked Judge Watson's order in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those same three justices said last month they would have allowed the Trump travel ban to take full effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The travel ban is already on the court's calendar for October, though the 90-day pause will have expired by then.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A plan by the Indian government to deport tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees will increase harassment of the persecuted Muslim minority while proving impossible to implement, activists have warned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, India's ministry of home affairs sent a letter to each of the country's state governments asking them to identify and deport all illegal immigrants, including Rohingya refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter said the refugees were a potential security threat and a burden on resources, calling on law enforcement and intelligence agencies to take &quot;prompt steps in identifying the illegal migrants and initiate the deportation processes expeditiously&quot;. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Madhurima Dhanuka, coordinator of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative's prison reforms programme, said deporting the Rohingyas to Myanmar was &quot;legally, procedurally and practically impossible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Rohingyas are not merely economic illegal immigrants, but people who have been forced to flee their homeland for fear of persecution,&quot; she said. &quot;This distinguishes them from other illegal immigrants who the government has the authority to deport or prosecute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Myanmar may be seeking to expel all Rohingya, says UN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although India is not a signatory to the 1951 UN refugee convention, it is &quot;bound by its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and customary international law to not extradite, deport, expel or otherwise remove a person from its territory where there are substantial grounds for believing that there is real risk of irreparable harm&quot;, Dhanuka added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of thousands of Rohingya have fled ethnic violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. While most travelled to Pakistan, thousands have crossed through Bangladesh into India since the 1980s, with about 40,000 settling. More than 16,000 are registered with the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But anti-Rohingya sentiment has been growing in India, which is predominantly Hindu. Earlier this year, in the northern city of Jammu, home to about 5,500 refugees, leaders of several Hindu groups launched a campaign to expel Rohingya from the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, one group put up posters calling on Muslim Rohingya and Bangladeshis to leave. In April, a statement from a local body of traders and industrialists said the Rohingya were &quot;criminals and drug traffickers disowned by their own country&quot;. They threatened a campaign to &quot;identify and kill&quot; Rohingya if the government did not deport them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local leaders of India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party have increased tensions by suggesting that Rohingya refugees could be used by Pakistani intelligence or Islamic State for espionage and terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter from the home ministry said: &quot;Illegal migrants are more vulnerable for getting recruited by terrorist organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Infiltration from [Myanmar's] Rakhine state ... into Indian territory, especially in the recent years, besides being [a] burden on the limited resources of the country, also aggravates the security challenges posed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We fled to India to save our lives. The authorities should not send us back to Burma, where our lives will be at risk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Syed Hussain    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR in Delhi said in a statement that the principle of non-refoulement - not expelling those who have the right to be recognised as refugees - is part of customary international law, and binding on countries regardless of whether they are signatories to the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Asylum seekers and/or refugees, wherever they are and wherever they may be from, should not be returned against their will to their country of origin,&quot; said the statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the UN secretary general, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, said: &quot;Refugees must not be sent back to places where they fear persecution.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonisation of the Rohingyas was irresponsible, said rights campaigners. Sahana Basavapatna, a refugee rights activist, said: &quot;If a person is found to have been involved in any offence, the justice system in India is functional enough to ensure that trials are conducted and the guilt or otherwise of the individual ascertained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This applies equally to Rohingyas who are accused of 'terrorism'. The entire Rohingya community cannot be said to be involved in terrorism even [if] some are accused of related offences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government announcement has spread fear across the Rohingya community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rohingyas in Burma continue to be victims of murder, rape, arson and other violence. Innocent Rohingya men are also being arrested and jailed,&quot; said Dil Mohammad, who fled Myanmar in 2007, and lives in Jammu with his wife and four children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rohingyas are still being targeted in violence and fleeing Burma. It is extremely unsafe for us to return,&quot; said Syed Hussain, who also lives in Jammu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To deport the Rohingya, who took refuge in India only to secure their lives and survive, is cruel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zafarul-Islam Khan    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We fled to India to save our lives. Indian authorities should be kind to us and not send us back to Burma where our lives will be at risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zafarul-Islam Khan, a Delhi-based Muslim community leader and human rights campaigner, said the deportation of the Muslim Rohingyas amounted to a &quot;betrayal of the liberal and secular values of free India&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hindu and Buddhist refugees from neighbouring countries are welcome in India. India has even allowed the Burmese Buddhist refugee political activities,&quot; said Khan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To deport the Rohingyas, who took refuge in India only to secure their lives and somehow survive, is thoughtless and cruel.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.K., Aug. 25 -- The UK Government made the following announcement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 8,500 Syrian refugees have been resettled in the UK under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement (VPR) scheme, new figures have revealed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-statistics-april-to-june-2017&quot;&amp;gt;quarterly Home Office migration statistics&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which were published on Thursday (24 August) show that over 1,200 refugees arrived through the scheme in the second quarter of 2017, meaning over a third of the 20,000 refugees the UK government pledged to resettle by 2020 are already in the UK. Approximately half of those who have arrived under the scheme are children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's figures also show Syrian refugees have been housed by more than 200 local authorities across the United Kingdom. The government continues to work with councils and devolved administrations to ensure placements are available as more vulnerable people arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm delighted with the significant progress we have made with the VPR scheme. Over 8,500 people have been resettled and more are arriving every month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will continue to work with local authorities and the &amp;lt;abbr title=&quot;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&quot;&amp;gt;UNHCR&amp;lt;/abbr&amp;gt;, whose hard work so far has made sure that the scheme is a success, to provide those who have been displaced by conflict with a safe environment and the opportunity to rebuild their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 2015, the government pledged to resettle 20,000 vulnerable Syrians who have fled the conflict in Syria to neighbouring countries by 2020. Last month, the scheme was expanded to include refugees of all nationalities. Additionally 3,000 children and adults will be resettled from the Middle East and North Africa through our Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, in July the government announced &amp;#163;1 million funding to help communities support refugees through the Community Sponsorship scheme. The scheme has been running for a year and 53 refugees have been welcomed by 10 community groups across the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has also already pledged &amp;#163;10m in English language funding to help Syrian families improve their English language skills. This is vital to help those coming to the UK find work, gain independence and give back to the communities that have welcomed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These resettlement schemes are only one of the ways the government is supporting vulnerable children and adults who have fled danger and conflict. The UK government remains the second largest donor in humanitarian assistance and has pledged &amp;#163;2.46 billion in aid to Syria and the neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK has also provided humanitarian support in response to the Mediterranean migration crisis of more than &amp;#163;100 million since October 2015. This includes providing winter clothing, hygiene kits and emergency medical care for those rescued at sea as well as protection for women and girls at risk of being trafficked.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">866 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by Macedonian newspaper Nova Makedonija on 10 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The migrant issue and the migrants' possible settlement in Macedonia have recently further heated up the political climate in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Completely different and contradictory information have spread in public almost simultaneously and with a growing intensity, ranging from reports that the country is preparing to accept and accommodate migrants on a permanent basis to the full dismissal of these claims as party propaganda. What is the truth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition's no-confidence motion against the foreign minister confirms that the opposition and government have locked horns regarding this matter. Namely, the opposition notes that one of the reasons for the no-confidence motion is the absence of a categorical, decisive, and clear position on -- as the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity] has put it -- the pressure exerted on the Republic of Macedonia to build asylum centres and refugee camps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The residents of the Republic of Macedonia do not want an additional budget or social burden and 10,000, 20,000, 40,000, or 80,000 migrants on their territory,&quot; Antonio Miloshoski [senior VMRO-DPMNE official and former foreign minister] said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the fact that the Labour and Social Welfare Ministry (MTSP) has denied all the speculations regarding the possible settlement of migrants on two occasions now and has said that no apartment buildings will be constructed in Macedonia nor new camps will be built for the refugees that are currently in Europe, certain nongovernmental organizations have started to prepare the public for a potential fresh migrant crisis, as well as for the possible construction of refugee camps countrywide, through active campaigns and public meetings. The opposition and some local authorities and mayors throughout Macedonia have harshly criticized these steps. The opposition and certain mayors have asked the government to fully reexamine or jettison the recent &quot;strategy on migrants and refugees&quot; because, according to their view, it jeopardizes the state security and economic system. The opposition VMRO-DPMNE believes that this strategy imperils the overall security, healthcare, and economic system in the country and that the government should give priority to the Macedonian citizens. This party has accused Labour and Social Welfare Minister Mila Carovska of trying to ignore the public opinion and instead implement a strategy that contravenes the public will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From a transit country, Macedonia will turn into a permanent residence for the migrants. According to this strategy, the migrants will be entitled to citizenship, whereby the country would be obliged to take care of them and employ them under circumstances when the unemployment rate in Macedonia is still high,&quot; VMRO-DPMNE officials claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia], on the other hand, calms down the public, saying that the VMRO-DPMNE continues spreading lies to cause fear and anxiety among the public in terms of the migrants because of its lack of ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let the public rest assured that Macedonia is a transit country for the refugees, while the relevant strategy respects the international standards and the 1994 Convention on the Refugees' Rights, which Macedonia has ratified. The 2017-2027 draft strategy for the integration of refugees and foreigners, which the VMRO-DPMNE currently uses for scaremongering, is merely a sequel to an identical strategy of 2009-2015, which was adopted by the government at that time, led precisely by the VMRO-DPMNE,&quot; the SDSM stresses. This party notes that this document serves merely as a guideline and is not a binding act for any ministry or institution. [passage omitted on foreign media reports on migrants' return]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, some national experts appeal for caution so that our country and the region should not be transformed into the European parking lot for refugees. Macedonia, as part of the migrant story, should be careful and abide by its policies in order not to get the worst of the bargain, experts advise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International law professor Lazar Lazarov believes that the Brussels policies towards the Balkans are confusing, two-faced, and insincere. Thereby, instead of pushing the region forward on its Euro-Atlantic road, the EU is actually making the Balkans regress with such proposals and policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I may freely say that the EU's present foreign policy seems ridiculous. It has problems not only with the refugees and the debt crisis, but also with its policies towards the Western Balkans. It all boils down to protecting the old EU member states' interests and to endless criticism, as well as to ultimatums to the regional countries on their road to EU accession,&quot; Lazarov claims. He underlines that such proposals for the refugees to be resettled on our territory deserve utter condemnation. In his view, Macedonia should be alert when making decisions so as not to get the short end of the stick in the refugee story and become the Balkan gathering spot of migrants and refugees, not of its own fault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations human rights commission has denounced the Australian government for withdrawing support to former Manus Island detainees as the stand-off over the provision of services to more than 600 men enters its fifth day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as detainees on Nauru call for an investigation into the death of a 29-year-old asylum seeker, who was killed in a road accident on the island nation on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Rupert Colville, spokesman for high commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, said the UN's human rights committee had &quot;serious concerns about the welfare, safety and wellbeing&quot; of the men who remained at the centre in Papua New Guinea, which was formally decommissioned on Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water to the centre and essential medical services were also cut off on Tuesday, while electricity was disconnected on Wednesday morning. The men have been digging for water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The breath of death on Manus Island: starvation and sickness | Behrouz Boochani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colville said the men were &quot;too frightened to leave&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We call on the Australian government, as the party who interned the men in the first place, to immediately provide protection, food, water and other basic services which have been cut off since authorities shuttered the facility on 31 October,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission repeated its criticism that Australia's offshore refugee processing regime was &quot;unsustainable, inhumane and contrary to its human rights obligations&quot; and said asylum seekers and refugees should be immediately transferred to Australia for processing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rallies in support of the Manus refugees were held in Canberra and Brisbane on Friday and planned for Melbourne and Sydney on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colville said Australia and PNG had responsibilities under the 1951 Refugee Convention to protect and provide for the men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The men have said they fear they will be subjected to violence at the hands of locals if they leave the compound - and, given there have been violent incidents in the past, we believe these fears should be respected and satisfactorily addressed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'All migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, are human beings. Like all of us, they have a right to a safe and secure environment, a right to an adequate standard of living and to participate in the decision-making process that is affecting their future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Human dignity should be ensured throughout the entire processing of their asylum claims. We urge the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea to fully respect their human rights, including their specific rights under international refugee law, and to enter into a dialogue with the men to ensure these rights are duly respected, protected and fulfilled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has rejected claims it abandoned the detainees, saying water, power and medical services are available at three alternative accommodation facilities that can be &quot;accessed at any time,&quot; and that comfortable and secure transport to take them to those facilities is also &quot;standing by&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has not addressed a report made by the UN high commissioner for refugees, which inspected the alternative accommodation this week and said one of the units was not ready for occupation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nauru, police reportedly arrested a man connected to a fatal crash that resulted in the death of a 29-year-old asylum seeker from Bangladesh, but detainees at the Nauru regional processing centre were concerned about the circumstances of the accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, who has been in Nauru for more than three years, died in a collision between the motorcycle he was riding and another vehicle on the road to Fly Camp, the detention centre for single men, about 2pm local time on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian Australia has attempted to contact the Nauruan government and the Australian immigration department to confirm the arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul has called for a full investigation to determine the circumstances of the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a lot of suspicion about what has happened,&quot; Rintoul told Guardian Australia. &quot;The fact that refugees are routinely hated just heightens their concerns even more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Shorten says Turnbull should consider New Zealand offer to take refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Nauru released a statement on Thursday saying &quot;reports on social media alleging this was more than an accident are false&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police are investigating the accident and no other details are yet available,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The Government of Nauru extends its sincere sympathy to the family and friends of the deceased.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, opposition leader Bill Shorten urged prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to accept a renewed offer from New Zealand to take 150 refugees from Australia's offshore processing camps, saying it was similar to the US resettlement deal brokered with former US president Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia rejected the offer when it was first made by former New Zealand prime minister John Key in 2013, saying people smugglers would see it as a way to provide backdoor entry to Australia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull is scheduled to meet New Zealand's new prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, this weekend.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interpreters for Syrian refugees should be given psychological support as a &quot;priority&quot; due to the stress the work causes, according to a study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers found that while arrangements under the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme (SVPRP) had exceeded the expectations of refugees, there were concerns about support given to interpreters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, which looked at how the scheme was rolled out in Edinburgh as a way to provide guidance for other authorities, highlights how the workers were often the &quot;only available staff&quot; to families, which saw them build close relationships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government makes U-turn to allow Syrian asylum seeker to remain in UK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interpreters reported breaking into tears during meetings and suffering bouts of depression as a result of what they were dealing with, often providing help out of hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SVPRP is a programme which commits the UK Government to resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees. It wasannounced by the Government following a public outcry over the fate of those attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 8,000 refugees have so far arrived in the UK under the scheme, which has had a &quot;truly transformative&quot; impact on people's lives, according to a recent report from United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have said they are grateful for the &quot;genuine welcome&quot; they have received in the UK, and are heartened that their children have been able to attend school and catch up on lost education, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latest study, published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health, indicates that not enough support id put in place for the interpreters required to support the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the interpreters said in the study: &quot;I just feel down and depressed because every day you are hearing what they've been through and it brings back memories to me, because we've been through this as well in my country - I was crying with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another added: &quot;I've done quite a lot of work with the police, hospitals and courts, but the fact that you establish a relationship with the families, things affect you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NHS Lothian consultant Dermot Gorman, co-author of study, said: &quot;It's always variable with each worker, each one has a different approach, but some would be going out on a Saturday evening to put in papers for appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could be stressful for interpreters. They were hearing stories that perhaps had resonance with their own lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8,000 Syrian refugees come to UK under plans to resettle 20,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Gorman said the programme has been largely successful and was confident the country could take in more of those in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems identified include language problems for the new arrivals and difficulties with navigating NHS services, which led to them using interpreters as a first point-of-call for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study focused on Edinburgh as it was one of the first in Scotland to take in large numbers through the resettlement scheme. It was announced last week that Scotland had taken in its target of 2,000 refugees three years ahead of schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Th researchers reviewed the successes and downfalls of the programme through the experience and opinions of interpreters during 2015 and 2016, and have called on a number of recommendations to be implemented. In its conclusion it said psychological support for them should be &quot;prioritised&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counselling is available for staff, but the paper said its availability should be reinforced in training for interpreters.It adds that management should consider the workers' own histories when giving them jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings, have been fed back to City of Edinburgh Council and NHS Lothian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Alison McCallum, NHS Lothian's director of public health and public policy, said: &quot;We are committed to ensuring all our staff, especially those who experience stressful situations through their work, have access to a range of occupational health support services to help them deal with stress and trauma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These services are made available to all our staff, including our interpreters, so that they are able to seek help when they need it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A City of Edinburgh Council spokeswoman said: &quot;We encourage all staff who encounter stress in their role to come forward and access the various support networks we have in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are aware of the report and will be considering whether it has any further implications for the support we give our interpreters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan is preparing for a sudden influx of North Korean refugees amid World War 3 fears</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junji Ito, a spokesman with the Ministry of Justice's Immigration Bureau, claimed that Tokyo was examining multiple options.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan's Deputy Prime Minister, Taro Aso, has suggested that simply killing refugees is also a possibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;They are illegal refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They might carry weapons. Terrorism might occur. We have to prepare our government to deal with such a situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They could be armed refugees. Would the response come from the police or defence operations by the Self-Defence Forces? Would they be shot? We must give this some serious thought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outspoken Taro Aso has previously stated that Adolf Hiter's &quot;motive was right&quot; in a statement that he later retracted following a stream of controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan was hit with a slew of refugees following in 1975 in the aftermath of the Vietnam War where Cambodians, Laotians and Vietnamese people arrived in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Watch has blasted Japan for &quot;not showing global ethical leadership on human rights&quot; after the country refused to accept refugees from areas such as Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of World War 3 is looking increasingly likely after the United States deployed 14,000 troops on aircraft carriers and destroyers off the coast of North Korea for a series of war games with Japan in drills likely to infuriate Kim Jong-un.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The servicemen will take part in the ten-day exercise, which will see US and Japanese troops performing war games in the waters off Okinawa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drills, which began on Thursday, are &quot;designed to increase the defensive readiness and interoperability of Japanese and American forces through training in air and sea operations,&quot; the US Navy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they also include aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan, and the guided-missile destroyers USS Stethem, USS Chafee and USS Mustin, among others - the first such deployment of three US carriers since 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war games come as tensions between North Korea and the US continue to escalate with President Donald Trump determined to showcase Washington's military might.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A US Navy spokesman: &quot;The exercise follows more than a week of scenario-based training ashore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The display of military force is meant to pressure North Korea and make it clear to Pyongyang the US can rapidly mobilise a potent military force.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The display of military force is meant to pressure North Korea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest exercise comes after three US aircraft carriers held rare joint drills in the western Pacific, joined separately by Japanese navy and South Korean warships over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Mr Trump hit back at critics of his Asia tour and vowed a global campaign of &quot;maximum pressure&quot; on North Korea, warning Pyongyang will not subject the world to &quot;nuclear blackmail&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by charities working on the ground in Dunkirk show babies less than a year old sleeping and crawling around in the woodland of one of a number of unofficial camps that have sprung up in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 20 infants are said to be in the camp, which reportedly accommodates between 300 and 500 people, many of them whole families including grandparents and pregnant mothers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities vow to keep giving food to Calais refugees despite ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most were former residents of the the Jungle camp in Calais and the Grande-Synthe camp in Dunkirk, both of which have been demolished in the past nine months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unofficial camp photographed, which is said to have grown considerably in recent months, is dismantled by police on a weekly basis to prevent it becoming more permanent - a process which sometimes sees children get hurt, according to volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one case a three-year-old was reportedly seen with bruised face - allegedly caused by a baton while on another occasion, a mother was said to have told police that her baby was sleeping in a tent, only for officers to proceed to pepper spray the occupants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers said there were between 40 and 50 young children in the camp, which contains no proper toilets and relies on donations from volunteers for tents, food and adequate clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heather Young, a volunteer with Paris Refugee Ground Support who was in the camp photographed earlier this week, said she saw &quot;dozens&quot; of babies and toddlers living in the woodland along with their families.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are dozens of young children, around 20 babies and toddlers, sleeping rough. There are also pregnant women and grandparents sleeping in tents,&quot; she told </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's horrific, unbearable. How anyone can live in woods pregnant? How do you have a one-month-old baby in a tent? How do you manage that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Refugee Ground Support's Ms Young, who has been working with refugees in France since last year, said the families in the unofficial camps tended to be the same ones &quot;again and again&quot;, although there is also a number of new arrivals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the fire in the Grande-Synthe camp in April, families were temporarily held in local sports halls, and then bussed out to accommodation centres across France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have since returned to the region with hopes of getting to the UK following a &quot;hostile&quot; reception from French authorities, volunteers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isis Mera, founder of grassroots organisation Help4Refugee Children, who took the photographs, said the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refugees had become &quot;much more visible&quot; in Calais and Dunkirk in the past few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said &quot;abuse and antagonism&quot; by authorities towards refugees across France was driving them back to the northern region to pursue dangerous journeys to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mera added that one family living in the woodland - a husband and wife with an eight-month-old daughter - are intent on reaching the UK illegally after being &quot;abused racially&quot; in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight-month-old baby who has never lived in a house (Isis </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mera</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had been moved to an accommodation centre after the demolition of the Jungle where the mother and baby had to share a bathroom with men. There, Ms Mera said, they received abuse and antagonism from local people. For this reason, they decided to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Young added that while previously, following the demolition of the two main camps, refugees had remained largely &quot;hidden&quot;, the numbers are now growing so quickly that people are becoming far more visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some remain hidden in the unofficial camps, but others are just sitting in the road. There are so many people now. How can you remain constantly hidden?&quot; she said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless the French and British authorities find a viable solution, this will just continue and get worse again. These people are resilient. They're used to it now. It's horrific that you get used to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tess, a volunteer fof charity Calais Action, who has recently visited several of the unofficialcamps,said: &quot;The UK and French authorities' strategy for tackling refugee homelessness is demonstrably failing, with rising numbers of people now living rough in Calais, Paris and Dunkirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow politicians to brush the problem under the carpet and pretend that they have it under control, or that the problem no longer exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as a report by charity Help Refuges seen exclusively by </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reveals that due to the current policies implemented by the French authorities that result in an unwelcoming environment in Calais, children face significant risk to their health and safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These risks are exacerbated by a lack of shelter, food insecurity, lack of personal hygiene, lack of safety and a lack of community, social security and a sense of normality - the report warns that children are being failed by both the French and UK authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When approached for comment, a spokesperson for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amira is a refugee. Over six weeks she has learnt the fundamentals of flower arranging alongside five other refugee and asylum seeking women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many others in the group, she had to leave behind acareerafter being forced to leave her home. InSyria, she was a teacher, a profession she loved but unable to teach in the UK, she's eager to learn a new set of skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Life is very different now,&quot; she says. &quot;In the future I want to be learning, and working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's final class of the course was a lesson in sponge arrangements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving on the final morning of the course before they graduate, the women have to step around heaps of freshly cut flowers. They howl with laughter as they catch up over steaming cups of tea. Having all met for the first time only six weeks ago, it's clear they've become close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The course is run by Bread and Roses, a social enterprise which trains and employs women in floristry. Meeting weekly at Hackney City Farm in east London, it's a space to learn English, develop skills and build confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-founded by Olivia Head and Sneh Jani in May 2016, Bread and Roses have run four programmes to date and worked with over 50 women from around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The kind of work that many refugee women end up doing because of their difficulty accessing the labour market - low paid, zero hour cleaning and caring jobs - is hugely undervalued and therefore unfulfilling,&quot; says Olivia. &quot;We wanted to help women get a step up into jobs that would be more meaningful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iman makes some final tweaks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phrase 'bread and roses' has been used as a political slogan ever since it was coined by American socialist and feminist, Rose Schneiderman, in 1912.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has become symbolic of the struggle of the female worker to have not only enough to buy a crust, but to be able to find meaning and joy in life and work.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having fled their homes in Syria, Eritrea and Angola, the trainee florists are all in the process of setting up new lives in London, a challenge they are committed to tackling quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugees are determined to learn English and start contributing to their new communities through work, volunteering and socialising with their neighbours,&quot; Mariam Kemple-Hardy, head of campaigns at Refugee Action told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They face huge barriers to learning, from a lack of provision to long waiting lists, with women in particular affected by cuts to funding for lessons and a reduction in childcare places.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kendra's arrangement will be transported across London to its new owner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bid to ensure mothers with young children are able to attend the course, Bread and Roses provides childcare for the duration of the classes. It's a measure that has allowed Amira to keep coming back every week. While her son, 2-year-old Mohammed, attends a baby musical play session with a volunteer child-minder, Amira is free to fully engage in the classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lola, a florist who volunteers with the group, speaks six languages and is constantly on hand to help with any floristry phrases getting lost in translation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Lola, some participants had been too nervous to practice English before starting the classes, despite having lived in England for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is like family and there are a lot of people to help, so they have new skills and are happy,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lola helps out with an arrangement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equipped with floristry skills gained over the last six weeks, Amira will now be able to do paid work with Bread and Roses - making bouquets that are sold to local businesses and customers across London.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the trainee florists, however, are yet to receive their refugee status which would allow them to work.The wait can be long and unpredictable; the number of asylum seekers in the UK waiting more than six months for a decision from the Home Officerose more than 70% over the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having faced such adversity to arrive in the UK, the immediate challenge facing these women has been contributing to their communities and feeling comfortable in their new country. Opportunities for them are beginning to proliferate around the UK, withOurmala providing free yoga classes, The Chickpea Sisters helping refugee women to work by equipping them with catering skills, and Women for Refugee Women on hand to offer overarching support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After six weeks of lessons in cutting, pruning and arranging, the newly minted florists are graduating. Armed with a certificate in floristry, all have opted to become part of the Bread and Roses freelance pool which will provide opportunities and act as an ever-expanding support network going forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd be very happy to find any work. Yes, no problem,&quot; says Amira.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of unaccompanied children in Greece have been left in limbo for more than a year after they were expected to be admitted to the UK as part of the British government's commitment to rescue Europe's most vulnerable young refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group of up to 60 children were expected to come to the UK under a scheme, created by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, that was intended to bring around 3,000 child refugees into the country. But despite being put through a time-consuming screening process and being identified as provisionally eligible this time last year, they have heard nothing about their applications since.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With refugee charities voicing their concerns about the fate of the children, Lord Dubs will visit Athens on Thursday to investigate the fact that no children have been transferred to the UK this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the 3,000 figure initially set as the UK's fair share of an estimated 90,000 child refugees travelling alone in Europe, just 200 came to the UK last year under the scheme, all of them from France. The government has made a firm commitment to house another 280, but charities express frustration that there has been no progress with applications submitted over a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is absolutely disgraceful nothing has happened,&quot; Dubs said. He admitted that he was disappointed that his scheme had only led to the transfer of 200 children. &quot;I'm both delighted for the sake of the small number of children that have come and who have found safety, but I'm bitterly disappointed that, given the political commitment to help, that the government is now seeking to back off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was private concern from some charity workers that the possible involvement of teenage refugees in the Parsons Green bomb attack might further delay progress in clearing more refugee children to be resettled in the UK. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dubs will meet some of the children in shelters in Athens this week, but many of them have subsequently gone missing, potentially exposing themselves to great personal risk by continuing to travel through Europe illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the delay in Greece may have been caused by the adherence to a requirement that child refugees must have arrived in Europe before March 2016, to be eligible under the scheme. As time passes, those young people who arrived before that date have begun to lose hope that there is any prospect of being helped under the scheme. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elianna Konialis of the charity Safe Passage, which has been helping to identify eligible children in Greece, said that dashing the children's hopes would have serious consequences. &quot;What is problematic is that some of these children had their expectations raised last year, they were asked if they wanted to go to the UK, and then put on hold for more than a year. They have completely lost hope. It feels like a broken promise. Having children in limbo and waiting is so detrimental for their mental health.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are currently around 2,400 unaccompanied refugee children living in Greece, less than half of whom are in official shelters. The rest are either homeless, or living precariously in informal shelters. In an open letter to Dubs, the charity Praksis, which houses a number of the children who had expected to come to the UK, said there was disappointment that a scheme designed to give sanctuary to a large number of unaccompanied minors fleeing from war zones and violent regimes was being implemented without the spirit of generosity that characterised the original project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's 16 months since parliament passed the Dubs amendment and it's time to get on with implementing it,&quot; said Natasha Tsangarides, of Safe Passage in Greece. &quot;Every day children are left waiting with uncertainty, they are unable to start the process of rebuilding their lives.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partly because there has been so little progress with the scheme, large numbers of unaccompanied minors have travelled to the UK illegally, risking their lives by smuggling themselves on boats and lorries, and those children who manage to get to the UK get some form of temporary leave to remain automatically. A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;In the past year, the UK has granted asylum or another form of leave to over 9,000 children and more than 42,000 children since 2010.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR has called on the UK to increase the number of refugees it resettles to at least 10,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities are also concerned about what will happen to the Europe-wide scheme for uniting refugee children with family members, once Britain leaves the EU. Unicef has called on the government to &quot;broaden its own rules and ensure the protection of unaccompanied refugee children&quot;. Lily Caprani, the deputy executive director of Unicef UK, said: &quot;It's critical that Brexit doesn't put at risk the ability of children fleeing war and persecution to reach the safety of their close family in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main Syrian opposition bloc has strongly condemned what it called attacks on Syrian refugees in camps in the Arsal area in Lebanon on 30 June, which resulted in the death of a number of refugees and the detention of hundreds more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Syrian opposition media report has called the incident &quot;a massacre&quot;. However, several Lebanese political groups have praised the &quot;qualitative operation&quot; of the army that spared the country further terror attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lebanese army command said that five militants had blown themselves up during a raid by Lebanese troops on refugee camps near the Syrian border, Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) website reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young Syrian girl was among those killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Massacre&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian opposition website Zaman al-Wasl reported from Lebanon that the Lebanese army killed 20 Syrian refugees in al-Nour camp in the town of Arsal on 30 June in an operation dubbed &quot;We'll keep you awake all night&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It called the incident &quot;a massacre&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video report said to be from inside the al-Nour camp, a woman - whose face was not fully shown - said: &quot;They have made men and women take off their clothes and then beat them.&quot; (http://bit.ly/2t5eeFD)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also identified the young girl who was killed as Najat al-Baik, from Ras al-Muarra town in Qalamoun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man was heard saying in the video: &quot;They crushed a girl in a tent, who seemed to be around five years old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that the army arrested 400 men and burnt down tents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a statement by the Lebanese army said that a girl had been killed when one of the suicide attackers blew up himself amongst a refugee family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian opposition condemnation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugees were humiliated and treated as hostages by the Lebanese army and the Hezbollah militias,&quot; the Turkey-based, opposition Syrian National Coalition said in a statement on 1 July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bloc said it holds the Lebanese authorities responsible for the safety of Syrian refugees in Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army's account</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lebanese army said that it had conducted an operation to search for militants and weapons in an area near the border town of Arsal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the raid, four suicide bombers struck al-Nour refugee camp, and a fifth struck in al-Qariya camp, the army added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 350 people were detained, including members of Islamic State (IS) group, Reuters news agency quoted a security source as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several MPs and other officials have said that the army's &quot;proactive&quot; step spared the country a real catastrophe that would have been carried out by extremist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately-owned Lebanese satellite station Al-Jadid TV reported on 30 June that it had obtained information that &quot;suicide bombers were preparing for a series of terror attacks across the country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most serious [development], is that the raid revealed that the terrorist groups had prepared a chemical container,&quot; Al-Jadid said, adding that the area that had been raided was controlled by the al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda's former Syria affiliate).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What next?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security operation in Arsal &quot;will definitely not stop at this point. It will continue in other refugee camps,&quot; wrote one commentator in privately-owned Al-Modon website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, the writer said, will prompt many refugees to seriously consider returning back to Syria, while militants might give up their arms to avoid a potential battle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Taylor, Elisaveta Dolghih, Jordan J. Ford and John L. Barber Esq</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">841 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Supreme Court, in a &quot;per curiam&quot; (by the court) decision, has handed the Trump Administration a victory in its long-running desire to implement a travel ban on nationals of six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees. On Monday, June 26, 2017, the Court agreed to permit partial enforcement of Executive Order 13780, amounting to a travel ban with a narrowed scope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The travel ban impacts nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen and all those seeking admission to the United States as refugees. Per the ruling, nationals of the six impacted nations face a 90-day suspension of admission to the United States, unless they can demonstrate a &quot;bona fide relationship with a person or an entity in the United States.&quot; Tourists from the six nations without close family in the United States will undoubtedly be barred from entering.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the biggest question left open by the ruling is what the impact will be on refugees. For a period of 120 days, refugees who have not already been issued a visa and do not have a &quot;bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States&quot; will be barred from entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees generally do not have offers of employment in the U.S. prior to being settled, and many lack close family in the U.S. For most, their only real relationship with the U.S. is with the refugee resettlement agencies who provide settling and support services. Every refugee entering the U.S. has a resettlement agency they are working with, but such a relationship may not satisfy the &quot;bona fide&quot; test laid out by the Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this mean for employers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As was the case with the implementation of the first executive order travel ban, the decision is likely to bring confusion, delays, and frustration at U.S. ports of entry and at U.S. Consulates abroad, as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is currently in consultations with the State and Justice Departments as to how to implement the decision. Many will recall the chaos and confusion that ensued after President Trump's first executive order on immigration was briefly implemented, before being stayed by lower courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court's decision is likely to add increased anxiety to an already tense foreign national community. Foreign nationals are facing increased scrutiny on visa applications filed at U.S. Consulates abroad, continued delays in adjudications by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services here in the U.S., and continued inconsistencies in adjudications of work authorization requests and in adjudications of immigrant visa petitions (&quot;Green Card&quot; cases).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the next ninety days, the entry of any foreign nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen is suspended. However, the suspension does not affect the foreign nationals from these countries who have a &quot;credible claim of a bona fide relationship&quot; with a U.S. employer or a family member in the United States. Those U.S. employers who are seeking to bring workers from one of the countries subject to the President's executive order will have to show that they have a &quot;formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course&quot; relationship with such workers. This includes workers who have accepted an offer of employment from an American company in the ordinary course of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the dissent, the next 90-days may bring with them a &quot;flood of litigation&quot; as the government and private individuals and employers attempt to determine what constitutes a &quot;bona fide relationship,&quot; who has a &quot;credible claim&quot; to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed in the ordinary course or to avoid the travel ban. Employers with employees or potential employees in the above countries should monitor such litigation as it may fill in the gaps left by the test articulated by the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court will give a closer consideration to the case in October, when they will hear oral arguments in the matter, but by that time the 90-day suspension may already be over, which could moot the entire dispute. For now, employers should focus on documenting any employment or prospective employment relationship they have with the foreign nationals from the above six countries to make sure that they can establish a &quot;bona fide&quot; employment relationship when seeking to bring such worker into the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If possible, foreign national employees are advised to avoid traveling abroad for the next 90 days, particularly if there is a need to renew their visa stamps before seeking re-admission. Entry to the U.S. for the foreseeable future will continue to be an unpredictable and uncomfortable experience for many.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE number of South Sudanese refugees fleeing war to Uganda has hit one million, the United Nations said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's youngest country emerged in 2011 following more than 40 years of fighting for freedom from Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, independence failed to bring peace, with a political power struggle between President Salva Kiir and former vice-president Riek Machar escalating into a civil war between ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last year the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNHCR) warned it could turn into genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People continue to leave violence in the impoverished country, with many crossing the border to Uganda, where those who gain official refugee status are given land to work from the government and host communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the number of arrivals - equivalent to the combined populations of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee - has now hit a new benchmark and the international community is being urged to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 85 per cent of refugees are women and children and report the forced conscription of boys, widespread sexual violence and the burning of civilians in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR, which is calling for &quot;urgent additional support&quot;, says it has received just 20 per cent of the funds it needs to support them this year and life saving work is now under threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High Commissioner Filippo Grandi, who visited Sudan this week, said: &quot;Host communities are generously sharing all available resources, but they are very visibly under immense pressure with already scarce resources. Parties to the conflict, regional states and the international community need to put an end to this tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme was forced to cut food rations for refugees in June and there is a shortage of doctors in the north of Uganda, where most South Sudanese refugees live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, children are schooled in classes which &quot;often exceed&quot; 200 pupils and are too big to be held indoors, while the distance from lessons cuts others off from education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lydia Zigomo, Oxfam's regional director of the Horn, East and Central Africa, said: &quot;As long as the senseless, costly and brutal war in South Sudan continues, its people will continue to flee in search of safety, food, water and shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Sudan's neighbours and the international community must honour their commitments to get the warring parties back to the negotiating table. Until then, it will not be safe for South Sudanese refugees to return home, forcing them to depend on aid across the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uganda's open-door policy to refugees has provided protection for one million South Sudanese - the third-largest population of refugees in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet Uganda is seriously under-funded. If international governments do not provide the money urgently needed, Uganda's refugee response could quickly buckle and fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sara Cowan, the charity's humanitarian campaigner, has just returned home to Glasgow after two months in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;It's hard to describe the impact so many people fleeing across the border is having on Uganda. I heard horrific stories of war tearing communities apart and people who'd been separated from their families during their panicked journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The international community can't leave Uganda to cope with this crisis alone. More funding and solidarity is urgently needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees on Greece's Lesvos island say they have turned to self-harming, in the hope that their actions will lead to a faster release from the poor conditions inside the detention centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known as the &quot;pre-removal centre&quot;, the compound is in a gated section of the Moria refugee camp and holds refugees who are expected to be deported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighteen-year-old Mirwaf Mansour*, who came to Greece as a refugee from Egypt, says he began cutting himself in a bid to get moved out of the detention centre, where he was held for 30 days after arriving at Moria camp in November 2016.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pulls up his shirt, revealing a deep scar on his back, before pointing out another gash on his wrist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mansour says poor living conditions and freezing temperatures made the detention centre unbearable. After waking up one morning to find one of the men he was sharing a room with dead, Mr Mansour says he became too afraid to even fall asleep during his detention. &quot;I was living there with six people from Egypt and one from Syria,&quot; he says. &quot;The one from Syria died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I woke up at seven one morning and went to wake everyone else up... but he didn't wake up. I think maybe it was because of the cold. It was freezing. After that, I didn't sleep for three days,&quot; Mr Mansour continues. &quot;I was so scared that if I fell asleep, I wouldn't wake up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Greece, Boris Cheshirkov, told The Independent the UNHCR has heard from refugees who have turned to self-harm in detention. &quot;Some people who are in the pre-removal have told UNHCR they have resorted to self-harm in the hope of being released,&quot; Mr Cheshirkov said. &quot;But the strain on their mental health should not be discounted,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cheshirkov explained that in the pre-removal centre, &quot;UNHCR has observed poor hygiene conditions and overcrowding&quot;. &quot;When this is coupled with the frustration of people, it contributes to mental and psychosocial problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;pre-removal detention centre&quot; is a closed section of the Moria refugee camp operated by the Greek Ministry of Migration Policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Greek law, it is designated as a &quot;special detention premises for the detention of third country nationals that have been issued with deportation or return decisions&quot;. Refugees who end up there are detained until the completion of the deportation or return procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sahar Mallah, Oxfam's Protection Manager on Lesvos, explained that as part of a program called Pilot Project, refugees from certain countries are detained upon arrival - often these refugees are from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan and several African countries. They often don't have access to a lawyer and live in worse conditions than other asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheshirkov said the Hellenic Police may detain asylum-seekers of countries with a &quot;low recognition rate&quot;, like the countries Ms Mallah mentioned. While several dozen nationalities are accommodated in Moria, the highest number of people are Syrian, Iraqi or Afghan - who have high recognition rates, he explained. Asylum-seekers from countries with a low recognition rate are surprised to find themselves in detention in a country where they were hoping to find freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saami El Mahdy*, 26, arrived at Moria in 2016 after being rejected entry by Turkey, but because of his Egyptian nationality, he spent over a year in detention where he says he was physically and verbally abused. Mr El Mahdy explains through a translator that he repeatedly asked officers and aid workers to explain why he was being held in the detention camp for so long, but he was never given an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in the detention centre that he started cutting his wrists. Asked what life was like in the detention centre, he turns over his arms, revealing a string of scars on both sides. &quot;I thought about dying,&quot; he said. &quot;They deal with humans like they're animals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr El Mahdy said in detention police officers &quot;hit him and said bad words&quot;. He says officers would beat him for no reason and call him words like &quot;motherfucker&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam says there have been rising rates of suicidal behaviour across refugee camps in Greece, with evidence of people burning themselves with cigarettes and abusing drugs like Vicodin, Trazadone and alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mallah said in the summer months, when Moria becomes even more crowded, living conditions worsen. A container appropriate for five people living in it could house as many as twenty. The more people, the worse the conditions get. &quot;A lot of people say they want to 'end their lives'...'I end up crying when I smile' or 'Death would be better than this,'&quot; Ms Mallah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rafat Zaghloul*, a friend of Mr El Mahdy, was also held at the detention centre when he arrived at Moria. He says he understands those sentiments. &quot;Why do they put us in prison? What's the reason? They're crazy,&quot; he says, shaking his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zaghoul says he was forced to flee Egypt after receiving death threats from Muslim Brotherhood when he refused to join the militant group. &quot;A lot of bad things happened. They said they would kill me, kill my father and my brother. Here, they tell me it's safe to go back to Egypt. Yes, Egypt is safe, but the Muslim Brotherhood is not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zaghoul says that while he does not feel it's safe to return to Egypt, he is desperate to leave Lesvos after being forced to stay in the detention centre. &quot;I wouldn't stay here,&quot; he says. &quot;I can't after the bad memories.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations officials today highlighted the need to continue working together towards more equitable ways to share the responsibility for refugees, as well as achieve safe and orderly migration, at an event to take stock one year after the international community agreed to find solutions to better manage human mobility.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe we can and must find a way through, based on a humane, compassionate, people-centred approach that recognizes every individual's right to safety, protection and opportunity,&quot; Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres said at the General Assembly side event on refugees and migrants.<BR><BR>Recognizing that the issue of large movements of refugees and migrants is too vast for any one country to handle on its own, the UN convened a meeting of world leaders in September 2016 with the aim of finding durable solutions.<BR><BR>At the High-Level Summit on Addressing Large Movements of Refugees and Migrants, all 193 Member States came together around one plan, the New York Declaration, expressing their political will to save lives, protect rights and share responsibility on a global scale.<BR><BR>Today's event provided an update on two key commitments of the Declaration - the global compact on refugees, and the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration.<BR><BR>Mr. Guterres pointed to several priority areas for the year ahead as Member States work to advance the two compacts, including re-establishing the integrity of the refugee protection regime, developing national and international cooperation mechanisms that take human mobility into account, and greater accountability for the human traffickers and smugglers who profit from exploiting the despair of the most vulnerable. The Special Representative for International Migration, Louise Arbour, underscored that the ability to better manage human mobility rests on both compacts being widely-supported; human rights-centred, and with the needs of those most vulnerable firmly at their heart.<BR><BR>Ms. Arbour, who is responsible for leading the follow-up to the migration-related aspects of the 2016 High-level Summit, urged that the global compact for safe, orderly and migration be grounded in reality.<BR><BR>&quot;The overwhelming majority of migrants move in a well-regulated fashion. Migration is a net positive to migrants and the communities from which they come and in which they settle.&quot;<BR><BR>The crises that drove the adoption of the New York Declaration have not abated, High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told the gathering. &quot;And the need for international protection for those fleeing in search of safety is more compelling than ever.&quot;<BR><BR>He noted that the root causes of refugee flows and the triggers of irregular migration are often intertwined, and in mixed migratory movements, refugees and migrants often face overlapping risks.<BR><BR>&quot;More safe and regular pathways for admission and the creation of a more tolerant and accepting environment, would bring important benefits for both groups,&quot; he stated.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papua New Guinea's supreme court has refused a bid to restore power, water and medical services to the Manus detention centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 600 refugees and asylum seekers have refused to leave the Manus Island detention centre, which was closed last Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Turnbull says Manus detainees aren't scared, just manipulated by 'activists in Australia'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electricity was shut off to the final compounds last Wednesday morning, more than 12 hours after the scheduled 5pm shutdown, and the generator was removed. Food, water and other essential services had already been stopped, and all staff left early on Tuesday last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The asylum seekers still living in the compound have pleaded for Australia and other countries to come to their aid, saying they are too scared to leave the compound to seek alternative accommodation in the main township out of fear they will be attacked by locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court application, brought by the PNG lawyer Ben Lomai and the Australian barrister Greg Barns, sought the restoration of food, water and health services to the detention centre, arguing to withdraw those before a safe resettlement option was available for the men was a breach of their constitutionally guaranteed human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But PNG's chief justice said he was satisfied the PNG government had provided alternative accommodation that allowed for free movement and that the services provided were of sufficient standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers say they are planning to appeal the decision, possibly as early as tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 600 men in the detention centre are running low on food, and are relying, in some cases, on wells they have dug and rubbish bins collecting rainwater, for drinking water. Several men are dangerously low on medicines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alternative accommodation the refugees and asylum seekers are being encouraged to move to is not yet ready for habitation, according to independent observers. But fundamentally, the men argue, they are not safe living in the Manusian community. Tensions between local people and the transplanted refugee population have been growing in recent months, and marred by several violent encounters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just now, the PNG court rejected our application,&quot; the applicant in the case, the Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani, said in the wake of the court's decision. &quot;It means the government can kill us by depriving us of access to food. We are outside of any law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International has said lives were at risk unless essential services were restored to the detention centre, and that refugees and asylum seekers should not be forcibly relocated until their dignity and safety could be guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If authorities don't act immediately, there is a real risk that the situation will catastrophically deteriorate,&quot; said Amnesty International's Pacific researcher, Kate Schuetze. &quot;The lives of these men, who are only asking for their rights to dignity and safety, are at serious risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus refugee who reached Canada last week says deaths are 'very likely'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the third time I have visited Manus Island but what we witnessed there over the past week shocked me to the core. This is a desperate situation on the brink of a catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That the Australian and PNG authorities have created such a crisis, leaving vulnerable refugees who sought Australia's protection in such a desperate situation is callous, cruel and completely disgraceful.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said the court's decision did not alter the Australian government's responsibility for those it had sent to Manus, nor the ongoing &quot;inhumanity&quot; of the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It does not alter the fact that Manus is unsafe, and settlement in PNG is impossible. The onus is still on the government to provide the safety and security that the refugees and asylum seekers need.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elaine Pearson, Australia director with Human Rights Watch, said the court ruling left hundreds of people stuck in a crisis situation, with diminishing supplies of food, water, and medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia established and subsequently abandoned this centre - it's up to Australia to bring these men to safety,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prime minister Turnbull can't turn a blind eye to the well-founded safety concerns these men have. Moving hundreds of men to a town where refugees have been beaten, stabbed and robbed is incredibly irresponsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's immigration and border protection department has rejected much of the testimony of independent observers and refugees themselves, saying: &quot; There has been significant misreporting in recent days about the situation in Manus province.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Claims that Australia 'abandoned' former-residents are not correct however; the department's staff no longer had authority to remain on the PNG naval base and they departed, along with other service provider personnel and PNG ICSA staff. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  MPs are craven milksops desperate for your approval. Call them about Manus! | First Dog on the Moon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former residents who choose to stay at the RPC site are doing so fully informed that PNG has provided them with suitable alternatives and that these can be accessed at any time. Any claims to the contrary are simply not true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the accommodation on Manus that has been, and is being built, is being paid for by Australia. The ongoing housing, food and healthcare costs for those held on the island are also Australia's responsibility. Australia has committed to funding all expenses of offshore processing, budgeting for between $150m and $250m on Manus alone this financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to international law - including the opinion of various United Nations bodies - Australia's has legal responsibility for the welfare of those on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull dismissed the fears of refugees who say they are too scared to leave the detention centre, claiming instead they were being encouraged to stay there by refugee advocates and the Greens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also rejected New Zealand's offer to take 150 refugees from Australia's offshore island centres, saying the Australia-US resettlement deal should be exhausted before considering that option.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under current Home Office rules only a select few asylum seekers can be granted permission to work, after waiting more than 12 months for a decision on their asylum claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means those like ballet dancers, whose jobs appear on a national shortage list, are able to work - while others , such as certain doctors, are not.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners want that changed, with any refugee left waiting on their asylum claim for more than six months given leave to work in any industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swindon City of Sanctuary, which supports refugees and asylum seekers in the town, say that the changes would lift vulnerable refugees out of poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiona Harvey, project manager for Swindon City of Sanctuary, said: &quot;These proposals would bring the UK in line with the approach taken by the majority of European countries and Canada. None have seen an increase in false claims by economic migrants as a result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, the UK government gives asylum seekers a &pound;36.95 weekly support payment. Swindon is one of four &quot;dispersal&quot; towns in the south west, with individuals posted here while their asylum claims are processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiona added: &quot;By allowing these asylum seekers the right to work it will allow them to lift themselves out of poverty, save the taxpayer money and reduce the incredibly high rates of depression and isolation created by preventing skilled people from working and integrating into the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives from Swindon City of Sanctuary visited parliament this week with national campaigners, aiming to raise awareness of the challenges refugees face in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners also called on the government to extend the time given to asylum seekers granted &quot;leave to remain&quot; to find accommodation and work from 28 days to 50 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former asylum seeker Ahmed, now based in Swindon, said he would welcome the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being told to leave his refugee accommodation, he spent five weeks on Swindon's streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed said: &quot;'Even if I had got my documents on day one, I had to apply for jobs, have the interviews and wait to be successful which can take another few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once someone becomes homeless it is much harder for them to get back on their feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesman said:&nbsp;&quot;Asylum seekers are not entitled to work while their claim is being considered which is to protect the resident labour market. This ensures access to employment is prioritised for British citizens and those lawfully resident here, including refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Asylum seekers who are granted refugee or other status in the UK are entitled to unrestricted access to the labour market and have broadly the same rights and benefits as British nationals and other lawful residents.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parliament visit came more than a year on from the foundation of Swindon City of Sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that time the group have set up a scheme matching homeless refugees with volunteer hosts with spare rooms, had 27 businesses and community groups pledge support to Swindon refugees, and established weekly food and music nights at town centre caf&eacute; Darkroom Espresso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicola Johnson, Swindon City of Sanctuary development worker, said: &quot;We are delighted with the success of the last year and we continue to be motivated and inspired by the people we meet to continue our work to help make Swindon a welcoming place for all and a town that's proud to welcome those who are seeking sanctuary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities are facing a stand-off with the detainees unwilling to go and locals are reportedly blocking the construction of new refugee accommodation, with doubts about whether there are enough beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees and asylum seekers who remain inside the compound in PNG have little water left and their electricity generators have either been switched off or let run out of fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last food packs were distributed to them on Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya refugee Imran Mohammad told RN Breakfast he did not think PNG authorities could protect them,&nbsp; ABC reported.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are not here for food, we are not here for electricity, we're not here for water, we're here because we're persecuted in our country we left violence. We want a safe country and we want our freedom,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamil refugee Srirangan told AAP on Tuesday refugees were concerned about dehydration but feared for their lives as well, as the troops roll in on Wednesday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities in PNG have said they will move refugees and asylum seekers into purpose-built accommodation in the nearby town of Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussein, originally from Iraqi Kurdistan, said the facility wasn't ready and that locals had blocked and protested its construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some locals have looted tents, tables, boxes, fire alarms, fans and air conditioners from the decomissioned centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG lawyer Ben Lomai has lodged a legal application on behalf of detainees to block the centre's closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitution in PNG held enforceable protections for human rights, which Mr Lomai said had been breached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lombrum centre was forced to close after the PNG Supreme Court ruled in April 2016 that Australia's detention of refugees and asylum seekers there was illegal and unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Papua New Guinea government is a sovereign government and is responsible for law and order and security on their islands in their nation,' Ms Bishop told ABC radio on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It makes no sense for these people to remain on Manus Island because the essential services have been transferred to alternative accommodation.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Bishop said food, water, electricity and medical services would be provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electricity has so far been cut to at least half the buildings at the centre at Lombrum Navy Base as detainees refusing to leave for fear of their safety nervously await their future.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration Minister Peter Dutton was labelled a 'monster' over the closure of the Manus Island detention centre as hundreds of former detainees barricade themselves inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens senator Nick McKim, who is on Manus Island, said he had seen first hand the suffering of 600 people and anybody who would deliberately cause such harm 'easily qualifies' as a monster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Dutton on Tuesday attacked Senator McKim for spreading false information and inciting trouble in the tense final hours of the centre's shutdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's a badge of honour to be attacked by a racist, a fascist, a monster, and a serial abuser of human rights like Peter Dutton,' Senator McKim told AAP from Manus Island on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The humanitarian situation in parts of Bangladesh sheltering hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees continues to deteriorate, making the crisis one of the fastest growing refugee crises of recent years, according to the United Nations.<BR><BR>&quot;[The crisis is] creating enormous humanitarian needs in an area of Bangladesh already affected by earlier refugee influxes, recent floods and not equipped to cope with large numbers of new arrivals,&quot; Andrej Mahecic, a spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told journalists at a media briefing in Geneva today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to estimates, some 380,000 Rohingya refugees, fleeing violence in Myanmar, have crossed the border into Bangladesh since 25 August.<BR><BR>&quot;A visit to the area this week by a UNHCR team, led by Assistant High Commissioner for Operations George Okoth-Obbo, found people suffering real hardship and some of the most difficult conditions seen in any current refugee situation,&quot; said Mr. Mahecic.<BR><BR>Refugees continue to arrive daily outside of the two established camps which are already substantially overflowing, and many people have received little meaningful help to date, he added.<BR><BR>The UN agency has been responding to the situation and assisting those coming but its in-country stocks have been exhausted, noted the UNHCR spokesperson, adding that deliveries of more aid - flown in earlier this week - are currently underway. Children worst affected<BR><BR>Challenges, however, are the greatest for children. According to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), there are at least 240,000 children among the refugees, including about 36,000 who are less than a year old. There were also 52,000 pregnant and lactating women. Conditions are ripe for the spread of disease [...] there are nowhere near enough latrines, and extreme mosquito activity has been forecast for the coming daysUNICEF spokesperson Marixie Mercado<BR><BR>&quot;Conditions are ripe for the spread of disease,&quot; Marixie Mercado, a UNICEF spokesperson highlighted at the briefing, noting that refuges have little protection from the elements and lack drinking water.<BR><BR>&quot;There is nowhere near enough latrines, and extreme mosquito activity has been forecast for the coming days. It is important to note that even before the crisis, half of the children in Rakhine state [in Myanmar] had suffered from chronic malnutrition, meaning they were vulnerable to disease,&quot; she said.<BR><BR>To help cope with this situation, the World Health Organization (WHO) is stepping up its efforts, and starting 16 September, will launch a polio and measles vaccination campaign to cover 150,000 newly arrived children aged 6 months to 15 years old, said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the UN agency.<BR><BR>&quot;In the coming days, [we will also] distribute emergency medical kits to cover 100,000 people, 2 million water purification tablets and cholera kits for 20,000 people,&quot; he added, noting that the UN health agency is also supporting the Government of Bangladesh in providing medical teams to new spontaneous settlements.<BR><BR>The World Food Programme (WFP), the UN's emergency food assistance agency, has also upped its response, delivering high-energy food bars, and together with partners, hot food and rice for cooking to tens of thousands of refugees. 'Remarkable generosity' of Bangladeshi communities<BR><BR>Mr. Mahecic also noted that Bangladeshi communities have shown &quot;remarkable generosity,&quot; welcoming refugees into their homes and sharing resources with them.<BR><BR>However, as the number of new arrivals continues, UN agencies are in urgent need of additional funds to provide protection and life-saving assistance.<BR><BR>Among them, UNHCR has appealed for an initial amount of $ 30 million for its emergency response in the country until the end of year.<BR><BR>Similarly, UNICEF made an initial appeal for $ 7.3 million over three months, including almost $ 3 million for water and sanitation alone, but that amount was calculated on the basis of 200,000 people and that number had now doubled.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's dirty little secret lies at the end of a winding country lane, in a valley dotted with ancient olive trees. Surrounded by wire fences and in places waist-high in rubbish, Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, which used to be a paradise for holiday-makers, is home to 7,000 people from a dozen nations, who are squeezed into a space that was meant to accommodate just 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, two years after a million migrants and refugees crossed into Europe, living conditions are becoming even more intolerable, as a fresh wave of refugees and migrants arrive on the Greek islands - many of them Syrian and Iraqi families.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are putting immense strain on the camp in Lesbos and others like it on Kos, Samos, Leros and Chios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sahar Mallah, from Oxfam, who works in the camp. &quot;People are living in freezing tents and there are huge concerns about the lack of sanitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is not enough room for everybody in the white metal containers set up by the government, so 3,000 people, including pregnant women, newborn babies and toddlers, sleep in tiny tents and under tarpaulins, set up on every available inch of space. Last winter, snow fell on Lesbos and five people died in Moria, at least two of them as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from makeshift heating to warm their freezing tents. The same is likely to happen this year unless urgent measures are taken - of which there is scant sign. The camp now resembles a shanty town, its lanes and alleyways strewn with discarded food containers, used nappies, chicken bones and plastic bottles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some women are so scared to go to the bathroom at night that they have taken to wearing adult nappies so as to avoid venturing out into the darkness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The women feel so unsafe. It is totally unacceptable,&quot; said Ms Mallah. &quot;There are women having to share tents with men they don't know and they are afraid. I've never seen that before in a refugee camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As conditions deteriorate, so too does people's mental health, with a sharp increase in refugees being referred to psychologists for attempting suicide, feeling suicidal, and exhibiting self-harm and panic attacks. In just five days this month, more than 100 migrants and refugees were referred to a mental health clinic in Mytilini, the main town on Lesbos. Aria Danika, a project coordinator from Medecins Sans Frontieres, said: &quot;The island has become a glorified detention centre. A patient recently said to me, 'Moria is the small jail, the island is the big jail.' The situation is deteriorating at an alarming rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People have had their spirit crushed as they don't know how long they will stay here. The asylum process is extremely convoluted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the chronic overcrowding, Athens announced this week that it hopes to transfer 5,000 of the most vulnerable refugees, including women and children, from the islands to the mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the mayor of Lesbos is sceptical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not confident that the refugees will be moved any time soon,&quot; said Spyros Galinos. &quot;Conditions in Moria are tragic and inhumane. It's nearly winter and people's lives are at stake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are currently 15,000 asylum seekers in camps on the Aegean islands stuck in limbo. Moria is so overcrowded that hundreds of refugees live in tents outside the camp, in an olive grove where many trees have been cut down for firewood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children play in little groups, scampering up and down a muddy bank while their parents go about the numbing daily routine of camp life - queuing for food or sweeping the space outside their tents with bunches of twigs. There is no hot water and the few showers are clogged with human faeces and rubbish, so people wash with ice-cold water from plastic pipes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the afternoon, as the sun sinks behind the hills and the temperature plunges, they light fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is not enough firewood to scavenge so they burn plastic bags and bottles, creating an acrid stench and dense plumes of black smoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very, very cold at night. To get food you have to queue for two or three hours and then it might be just a piece of cake,&quot; said Mustafa Mohib, 24, an engineer from Kabul, who has been at the camp for three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sleeps in a small tent, set up on wooden pallets, with three other Afghan men. &quot;We have nothing to do - we just walk around. We may have to wait three months, one year, two years - we don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people have been here for 20 months - ever since March last year, when the EU signed a (EURO)3billion (&pound;2.6billion) deal with Turkey designed to stop the refugee flow. On the camp's perimeter wall, the words &quot;Welcome to prison Moria&quot; have been sprayed in large black letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the refugees don't even have socks - they walk around in flip-flops. Stray dogs wander through the camp, some of which have been adopted by refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With people having to queue for so long for meals, clashes inevitably break out. &quot;It's very bad. There's often fighting in the food queues - then the police tell everyone to go away, so you end up with nothing to eat,&quot; said Mohamoud Hajji Ibrahim, 23, from Somalia. A former cameraman for a Somali television channel, he says he fled after being beaten and threatened by al-Shabaab extremists. &quot;I don't know how long I will be here - two years maybe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complexity of thousands of asylum requests and a lack of trained personnel means that Lesbos and the other islands have become a giant bottleneck. Those whose asylum bids are turned down are supposed to be returned to Turkey, but since the returns policy began in March last year, only 1,400 have been sent back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Turkey-EU agreement remains valid, although we would like to see more returns because that will restore the order of things. Things need to move faster,&quot; Ioannis Mouzalas, the Greek migration minister, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dozen humanitarian organisations are calling on the Greek government to empty the islands and transfer all the asylum seekers to the mainland, where conditions are better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that would contravene the EU-Turkey deal, which calls for people to be kept on the islands until their applications can be dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is deadlock. And despair.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queen Rania was visiting the Kutupalong camp in her role as board member of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and as an advocate of the work of UN humanitarian agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She met with emergency services offered by humanitarian agencies at the camp, stopping at a healthcare centre and school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then proceeded to the surrounding makeshift settlements, which were recently haphazardly set up to provide additional shelter to incoming refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After meeting with women and children in the makeshift camp, she described their &nbsp; stories of 'unimaginable acts of violence.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: 'Before coming here, I had braced myself to witness some desperate conditions, but the stories I heard today were heartbreaking and harrowing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I've heard of systematic rape of young girls, who were trapped in schools and raped by soldiers. I've heard of babies being kicked around like footballs and stomped on.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I've heard family members telling me how they've seen their own parents killed, right before their eyes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is something that is unacceptable. It is unforgivable that this crisis is unfolding on the world stage to a largely indifferent audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The world seems to be silent to what many are acknowledging now as an ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslims.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queen Rania's visit to Bangladesh coincides with a UN conference taking place in Geneva, aiming to mobilise international resources for the Rohingya Refugee Crisis Response Plan.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan, which calls for $434million to help 1.2 million refugees up to February 2018, is currently only 26 percent funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar leader&nbsp;Aung San Suu Kyi has been criticised for her failure to denounce the military crackdown on the Rohingya population since August.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When this is coupled with the frustration of people, it contributes to mental and psychosocialproblems.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheshirkov said the Hellenic Police may detain asylum-seekers of countries with a &quot;low recognition rate&quot;, like the countries MsMallah mentioned.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum-seekers from countries with a low recognition rate are surprised to find themselves in detention in a country where they were hoping to find freedom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saami El Mahdy*, 26, arrived at Moria in 2016 after being rejected entry by Turkey, but because of his Egyptian nationality, he spent over a year in detention where he says he was physically and verbally abused. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the UNHCR has heard from refugees who have turned to self-harm in detention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some peoplewho are in the pre-removal have told UNHCR they have resorted to self-harm in the hope of being released,&quot; Mr Cheshirkov said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When this is coupled with the frustration of people, it contributes to mental and psychosocialproblems.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Refugees who end up there are detained until the completion of the deportation or return procedures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sahar Mallah, Oxfam's Protection Manager on Lesvos,explained that as part of a program called Pilot Project, refugees from certain countries are detained upon arrival - often these refugees are from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistanand several African countries. They often don't have access to a lawyer and live in worse conditions than other asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cheshirkov said the Hellenic Police may detain asylum-seekers of countries with a &quot;low recognition rate&quot;, like the countries MsMallah mentioned. While several dozen nationalities are accommodated in Moria, the highest number of people are Syrian, Iraqior Afghan -who have high recognition rates, he explained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum-seekers from countries with a low recognition rate are surprised to find themselves in detention in a country where they were hoping to find freedom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saami El Mahdy*, 26, arrived at Moria in 2016 after being rejected entry by Turkey, but because of his Egyptian nationality, he spent over a year in detention where he says he was physically and verbally abused. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people say they want to 'end their lives'...'I end up crying when I smile' or 'Death would be better than this,'&quot; Ms Mallah said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hormone is released naturally by humans during social and sexual behaviour, and research has shown it breeds trust and generosity in others.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxytocin, known as the love or 'cuddle hormone',&nbsp;together with being surrounded by charitable peers was found to boost people's willingness to donate money to refugees in, even in those with a sceptical attitude toward migrants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT IS OXYTOCIN?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxytocin, known as the 'love hormone', engenders trust and generosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hormone is released naturally in the blood and brains of humans and other mammals, during social and sexual behaviours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hormone is produced by women during labour to help them bond with their baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also released during lovemaking, leading to it being nicknamed the 'cuddle chemical'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other loving touches, from hugging a teddy bear to patting a pet dog, also trigger its release.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers, from the University of Bonn in west Germany, claim their finding could eventually help people adapt to living around migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The combined enhancement of oxytocin and peer influence could diminish selfish motives,' study lead author Professor Rene Hurlemann said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Given the right circumstances, oxytocin may help promote the acceptance and integration of migrants into Western cultures,'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first of two experiments, scientists, from the University of Bonn in western Germany, showed 183 German study participants a series of 50 brief, real-life stories of refugees or native people in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of the accounts, shown as text on a computer screen, described the personal needs of poor people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half of the stories of people in need were portrayed as refugees, and half as German natives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         OXYTOCIN MYSTERY                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two main theories exist on how and why the body releases oxytocin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some scientists believe that the hormone is released primarily to enhance a relationship and make it stronger when you're with someone you love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others believe that oxytocin levels increase primarily when we find ourselves in difficult or even threatening situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In those cases, the hormone helps us seek out new social relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists are yet to definitively answer which of the two theories is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The personal needs were all what the United Nations has defined as minimum standards for leading a safe and dignified life, namely access to food, adequate housing, or participation in social and cultural life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subjects were given (EURO)50 (&pound;45 or $59) and could donate a maximum of (EURO)1 (&pound;0.91 or $1.20) to each case, leaving them the rest as personal payoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We were surprised that the participants in the first experiment donated around 20 percent more to refugees than to local people in need,' said Ms Marsh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another independent experiment involving over 100 participants, the subjects' personal attitudes towards refugees were assessed in a questionnaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, half of the group received the bonding hormone oxytocin via a nasal spray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other half of the group received a placebo before they went through the donation task used in the first experiment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the influence of oxytocin, the individuals who tended to show a positive attitude towards refugees doubled their donations to both the locals and the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, oxytocin had no effect in individuals who expressed a more defensive attitude towards migrants: In those participants, the tendency to donate was very low to locals and refugees alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Oxytocin clearly increases generosity towards those in need, however, if this altruistic fundamental attitude is missing, the hormone alone cannot create it,' said Professor Hurlemann.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a third experiment, the team found that the addition of positive social cues drastically increased generosity among xenophobic test participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this test, the team presented participants with the average donation their peers made in the first experiment under each donation story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half of the participants once again received oxytocin, while the other half got a placebo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Now, even people with negative attitudes towards migrants donated up to 74 per cent more to refugees than in the previous round,' said Ms Marsh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the combined administration of oxytocin with a social norm, the donations for refugees in those sceptical towards migrants nearly reached half of the sums donated by the group, which showed a positive attitude towards refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     THE DARK SIDE OF THE 'LOVE HORMONE'&nbsp;                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study published in May 2017 suggested that oxytocin could play a role in how we deal with crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers discovered that the hormone is released when people feel their relationship is under threat, helping them to re-engage with their partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An international team of researchers led by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway, looked at the effects of oxytocin when a relationship was under threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers examined 75 American couples, and 148 Norwegian individuals who were one of the partners in their relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants were asked to spend a few minutes thinking about their relationship, before writing about ways that their partner responds to them, or how they wished their partner would respond to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxytocin levels were measured both before and during the tasks.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partners who were more invested in a relationship released more oxytocin when they thought about their relationship than the less invested partner did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, oxytocin may be acting like a relationship 'crisis hormone'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Our results suggest that there should be a greater focus on enabling positive social encounters among citizens of hosting countries that communicate a prosocial norm,' Ms Marsh told MailOnline.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For example, if people whom we trust, such as supervisors, neighbours or friends, act as a role model by making public their positive attitude towards refugees, more people would probably feel motivated to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In such a 'prosocial' context, oxytocin could increase trust and minimise anxiety - experience shows that the oxytocin level in the blood increases during social interaction and shared activities.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ardern had said she planned to sit down with her Australian counterpart during the east Asia summit in the Philippines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it appeared that no such meeting had been held in Manila, leading to New Zealand media reporting that she had been snubbed.. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by reporters on Tuesday night  if she had met Turnbull she said: &quot;Not since I saw him in passing but our officials have been talking together.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed if that was the more substantive discussion she had called for two days before, she replied, &quot;no, not necessarily&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both of us are busy, involved in the summit and other bilaterals,&quot; she said. &quot;I think we're splitting hairs a little bit of whether it needs to be formally sitting down or over a cup of tea in a waiting room... You'd be surprised what I can do over a cup of tea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ardern's press secretary Mike Jaspers said she had not been ignored and that the two leaders had &quot;a series of discussions which together have been substantive&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull's office was contacted for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull was asked in Manila on Tuesday about the refugee resettlement and said &quot;as you know, the prime minister of New Zealand and I have had discussions about that&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand has a long-standing offer to take 150 refugees a year from Australian-run offshore detention centres, a deal Canberra has repeatedly rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia claims agreeing would provide a &quot;back door&quot; route via New Zealand for people to get to Australia and Turnbull has said it would be &quot;a marketing opportunity&quot; for people smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ardern also played down suggestions that her offer had restarted &quot;chatter&quot; among people smugglers about targeting New Zealand as a &quot;soft touch&quot; for their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been given no indication that that chatter ever stopped. We know it has been an ongoing issue,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Turnbull could go to Manus to see what's happening. But that would take courage | Nick McKim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ardern, 37, who became prime minister less than a month ago, pushed the issue during a visit to Sydney but Turnbull again rebuffed the offer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government would consider the deal once it had completed a transfer of refugees to the US, which has agreed to take up to 1,250 refugees from Manus, Papua New Guinea, and Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, only 52 refugees to be accepted for resettlement have left the Pacific island camps. US president Donald Trump has lashed the deal made by Barack Obama as &quot;dumb&quot; and complained in a phone call to Turnbull that it would &quot;make me look terrible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 400 refugees and asylum seekers have locked themselves in an abandoned detention centre on Manus after the Papua New Guinea government closed the facility last month. They are living without without power or medical aid but say they fear for their safety if they were to leave. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International reports 90 men are now sick and the UN's refugee agency says the situation inside the centre is a &quot;humanitarian emergency&quot;. The agency has urged both PNG and Australia to end the &quot;unconscionable human suffering&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ardern said her offer was made &quot;because we saw a great need. No matter what label you put on it there is absolute need and there is harm being done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see the human face of this and I see the need and the role New Zealand needs to play. I think it's clear that we don't see what's happening there as acceptable, that's why the offer's there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations refugee agency on Tuesday urged Australia to accept New Zealand's offer. &quot;We urge Australia to reconsider this and take up the offer,&quot; Nai Jit Lam, deputy regional representative at the UNHCR said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand currently accepts 750 refugees every year. The new Labour government pledged to double that number in the next three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee advocates in New Zealand have urged her new Labour government to bypass talks with Australia. They say she could make an offer directly with PNG authorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees wake me up early in the morning. When this happens, it's like suddenly entering a nightmare. The last time I experienced this was two months ago when they woke me up to news of the death of Hamed Shamshiripour. Hamed's dead body was found hanging with a noose around his neck one rainy morning in the East Lorengau camp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Shorten says Turnbull should consider New Zealand offer to take refugees</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one has died today. However, the news is that death is on its way to take someone else from us. It's a Rohingya refugee who is known to have been suffering from an illness. For years this middle-aged man has been battling against epilepsy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hurry over to Oscar camp. The refugees have laid him out on the floor. The rim of his mouth is covered in foam and it seems his eyes have doubled in size. What could one possibly do in this situation? There is no medicine here. Everyone is perplexed and in a state of panic. One person pours water over his face. Everyone wants to do something, even though we all know too well that our efforts are in vain. He's lying there for an hour before he finally starts to feel better. Everyone is frightened. Manus prison can no longer tolerate the death of another individual. There is a mood of death, climate of death. And for a moment the presence of death has completely disrupted the equilibrium in prison. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Death is always ever so present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The breath of death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scent of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reign of death over Manus prison. This is the reality of living out here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I return to Fox prison. On the way I see a few people drawing up water in buckets from the well that they have dug up within Oscar camp the night before. For a moment my mind captures the image of a well inside a strange and faraway prison. I pass the middle of one of the corridors in Delta. A group of men are still sleeping, all laid out and their clothes stripped off. They are sleeping in a manner that resembles people who have been knocked unconscious. The mosquitoes on Manus have no mercy. All throughout the night they are at work, busy trying to suck our bodies dry. It is supposed to rain today. After all these years I have really come to understand the ecosystem here on Manus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managing all this media attention has become a difficult task. I receive calls from every point on the globe, in every language. The situation is so very critical. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I receive news that one of the refugees, who had gone to East Lorengau just days before, is spotted walking back here along the road. For a moment I picture him, even more afraid and even more weary than the men who I see around me here. I picture him alone, nowhere to turn to for protection ... I picture him there, walking alone on an unknown path through the jungle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout all the corridors within Fox I witness the same scene that I have encountered in Delta. Men with their clothes stripped off lying down on the ground. A group of refugees is running about and searching for something. Some of them are preparing the garbage bins in order to collect rainwater. They are like men from a rescue team; a great spirit of collective action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the sounds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the shouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They all saturate the prison landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few individuals get up onto the roof of the bathrooms to sweep up the leaves so that if it is going to rain the water can flow into the tanks and the bins with ease. Two news reporters and photographers from The Australian have arrived by boat. I am worried. A few moments later they enter Oscar. When the refugees see their cameras they circle them like a swarm of bees. The photographer gets excited. The place is full of subjects for him to hunt down and capture. Although he seems to be anxious, he still photographs the sick Rohingyan refugee, another man whose eye is infected, and one who had shown him a letter. He also take shots of the whole community of bewildered and worn-out refugees. They are there for less than 10 minutes. They do what they have to do in a hurry and leave. I pursue them the whole time they are here. I shake hands with them and request that they report fairly and stand up for justice. They say: &quot;Of course, that's exactly what we plan to do.&quot; I am still worried. I hope that is what eventuates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rain suddenly starts to pour. Thunder and lightning comes from the sky. Until now I have never seen the Manus sky so furious - it unleashed its anger with hammers and fire. The garbage bins are filling up with rainwater delivered from the tropical heavens. This rain is such an enormous blessing - it is delivered with perfect timing. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the afternoon we receive news that the refugee who was making his way back from East Lorengau has arrived. I see him. He has walked for more than 30 kilometres. He is exhausted - even more fatigued than the incarcerated refugees. And he is starving - hungrier than the refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A missionary on Manus wants to bring food for the refugees but is prevented by the navy. The Australian government insists on starving everyone. I have to eventually make my way to Delta prison. The silent protest begins at five. The mosquitoes of Manus are again ruthless and barbaric. Another tough night awaits. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has been accused of routinely denying support to asylum seekers, leaving them homeless and and unable to feed their families, following analysis of more than 300 recent cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research conducted by Refugee Action found that the Home Office was missing its own deadlines for finding emergency accommodation for homeless and destitute asylum seekers, and in some cases wrongly refusing those who make claims for emergency assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one case, it took more than 10 months to make a decision on whether to grant an applicant asylum support - so long that the person had already received refugee status.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'They promised me, then refused me': asylum seekers denied support by Home Office</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum seekers interviewed for the report say these errors have had dire consequences, including forcing families to stay in accommodation deemed not fit for habitation, with leaking toilets or no heating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One mother and her child reported sleeping on the floor because it was the only place they could avoid being bitten by bed bugs; a pregnant woman was forced to choose between sleeping on a stranger's sofa and sleeping in the street; at least one person has attempted suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Action analysed 315 cases logged between January 2016 and March 2017 in which they or another refugee charity, Asylum Support Housing Advice (ASHA) in Manchester, helped asylum seekers to apply for support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum seekers are not allowed to work or receive mainstream benefits while they wait for a decision on their claim, but support is available to those who are destitute. Section 98 support helps provide emergency accommodation and board, while section 95 support is longer-term and entitles people to accommodation and an allowance of &pound;36.95 per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analysis found that applications for section 98 support were regularly wrongly rejected. Of the 88 people Refugee Action helped with applications, less than half were initially approved. Of those Refugee Action assisted to reapply, 92% were subsequently granted. In a large majority of these overturned cases, the successful second application offered no new evidence, indicating the Home Office was wrong to initially refuse the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an appalling scandal and it has to stop,&quot; said Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action. &quot;The government does have, on paper, policies and procedures to ensure that people who have fled war, abuse and persecution don't end up homeless. But in practice they are consistently in flagrant breach of those policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The scale of the Home Office failure to follow those policies and procedures is pretty staggering. In more than nine out of 10 cases for them to change their mind and issue an approval for a request for accommodation and support when they refused it the first time is extraordinary. There's clearly a huge gulf between what the system should be doing for people and what it's actually doing in practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also alleges the Home Office is failing to meet its targets for providing emergency support, putting vulnerable people at risk of homelessness. According to Home Office guidance, a decision on section 98 emergency support should be given on the day the application is made, as long as the application is submitted by 3pm, due to the fact the application is for emergency assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In seven of the 88 cases Refugee Action assisted with in Manchester, no response was received by the Home Office that day, despite the application being made in time. In several instances Refugee Action paid for the applicant to stay at a hostel that night to prevent them from sleeping rough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also found issues with the granting of section 95 support. People supported by Refugee Action or ASHA waited an average of 59 days to receive the support after submitting an application. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man from Eritrea waited 308 days to hear about his claim and was granted refugee status before he received an answer. During this time he and his wife struggled to feed their child and baby and could not afford to heat their home during winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and anyone who has an emergency need for accommodation can ask to be put in initial accommodation whilst their applications for support are processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute are provided with free, fully furnished accommodation. We also cover utility costs and provide a cash allowance to cover other essential living needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior United Nations officials are urging the international community to come together in support of a 23 October pledging conference to &quot;send a strong message to Rohingya refugees and their generous hosts in Bangladesh that the world is there for them in their greatest time of need.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since late August, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya trying to escape discrimination and persecution in Myanmar's Rakhine state have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, sparking the world's fastest-growing humanitarian emergency, according to the United Nations.<BR><BR>&quot;We call on the international community to intensify efforts to bring a peaceful solution to the plight of the Rohingya, to end the desperate exodus, to support host communities and ensure the conditions that will allow for refugees' eventual voluntary return in safety and dignity,&quot; the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a joint statement Monday.<BR><BR>&quot;The origins and, thus, the solutions to this crisis lie in Myanmar,&quot; added the UN High Commission for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, the UN aid chief, Mark Lowcock, the Director General, of IOM, William Lacy Swing.<BR><BR>They underscored that Bangladesh has kept its borders open, offering safety and shelter to fleeing families.<BR><BR>&quot;We have been moved by the welcome and generosity shown by the local communities towards the refugees,&quot; the senior officials stated, while noting their respective agencies have been working in overdrive with the Government of Bangladesh, local charities, volunteers and non-governmental organizations to provide assistance. Still much more is urgently needed.<BR><BR>The refugees are fully dependent on humanitarian assistance for food, water, health and other essential needs as basic services are under severe strain and some sites lack access to potable water and sanitation facilities, raising health risks for both the refugees and the hosting communities.<BR><BR>&quot;The efforts must be scaled up and expanded to receive and protect refugees and ensure they are provided with basic shelter and acceptable living conditions. Every day more vulnerable people arrive with very little - if anything - and settle either in overcrowded existing camps or extremely congested makeshift sites,&quot; the statement continued.<BR><BR>It announced that the ministerial-level pledging conference, set to be held in Geneva on 23 October, organized by OCHA, IOM and UNHCR and co-hosted by the European Union and Kuwait, will provide Governments an opportunity to show their solidarity and share the burden and responsibility.<BR><BR>&quot;Their further generous support for the Joint Response Plan, which was recently launched by the UN and partners, is urgently needed to sustain and scale up the large humanitarian effort already under way. The plan requires $ 434 million to meet the life-saving needs of all Rohingya refugees and their host communities - together an estimated 1.2 million people - for the difficult months to come,&quot; added the statement.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">805 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Serbian pro-western Belgrade-based Radio B92 website, on 24 October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign minister: Serbia has largest number of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Europe. There is absolutely no alternative to working together, the first deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ivica Dacic, has told the OSCE Mediterranean Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday, October 24: The current refugee and migrant situation calls for unabated attention, efficiency and, above all, solidarity among all relevant actors, Dacic said as he addressed the gathering in Palermo, Italy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means not only providing emergency humanitarian assistance to refugees and migrants in the current crisis, but also seeking and finding durable solutions for persons in protracted displacement, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no doubt that dealing with this major issue requires awareness of the root causes underlying the movement of population, such as the conflict in Syria and the overall fragile situation in the Middle East region, the series of conflicts in Africa, coupled with poverty, hopelessness and political instability in many developing countries across the globe,&quot; Dacic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister stressed that he &quot;firmly believes that a comprehensive solution should be found both on the European, as well as the global level, since this is not a problem within geographic confines but a phenomenon of global scale, unprecedented in the post-World War II period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must not lose sight of the fact that the huge influx of refugees and migrants to the countries of Europe, within a short space of time, has made the local communities along the migration route incapable of quickly absorbing this inflow, giving at the same time rise to increased xenophobia and resentment of migrants in many countries,&quot; Dacic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian minister underlined that since mid-2015, Serbia has been in the very center of the so-called Western Balkans migration route transited by most migrants on their way from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and other turbulent regions to the countries of Western and Northern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalled that the Western Balkans route was officially closed in March 2016, after an agreement had been reached at the EU - Turkey Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the number of persons in transit was significantly reduced, resulting in their lengthier stays in the territory of transiting countries, including Serbia - thus acting as a significant burden on the available capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past two years more than 900,000 refugees and migrants transited through Serbia. We have demonstrated our solidarity and humanity, for which Serbia frequently receives praise from migrants themselves, but also from the international community,&quot; Dacic said and stressed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our empathy for refugees and migrants and essential understanding of their suffering and predicament stems from the fact that we have been faced with the problem of refugees and IDPs for more than two decades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the UNHCR data, the minister continued, our country is even today home to a total of 250,000 refugees and IDPs living in protracted displacement, the largest number in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reduction in the number of refugees in the territory of the former Yugoslavia was largely the result of their integration in the Republic of Serbia, which bore the largest burden of a durable solution for the refugee problem. Regrettably, out of 200,000 IDPs from Kosovo and Metohija, only 4,000 of them or 1.9 percent have returned to their homes,&quot; Dacic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underlining that there was &quot;absolutely no alternative to working together,&quot; he pointed out that &quot;dealing with the complex challenges that we are facing will only be successful if we join our efforts and manage to act with full respect to the basic values, principles and commitments of the OSCE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magnitude and complexity of the challenges faced by the Euro-Mediterranean region cannot be addressed by a single state or organisation on its own, the minister warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must jointly develop comprehensive, humane, and sustainable solutions thus providing for basic human dignity and protection needs of refugees and safeguarding the human rights of all, but at the same time, guaranteeing security of the recipient countries,&quot; Dacic said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dacic concluded his address by saying that wished to &quot;emphasize once again that the Republic of Serbia remains committed to pursuing and strengthening cooperation with Mediterranean partners, including through the OSCE, wherever the organisation can be of assistance with its comprehensive approach to security.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE team behind a temporary housing scheme for new refugees have welcomed a decision to introduce a new council tax policy for their hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns had been raised over fears that people living alone and providing a home for a refugee could lose the single person council tax discount and be financially penalised for their generosity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When an asylum seeker is granted leave to remain in the UK - often after a lengthy and uncertain wait - there is only a very short window between hearing the news and losing the modest financial and accommodation support provided by the Home Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joyous occasion can quickly turn to one of worry and panic as they realise the safety net they have relied on will come to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It often takes longer than the 28 days they're given to secure a National Insurance number to be able to work, let alone save for a deposit on a flat or a room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the Adver reported that 46 new refugee households had fallen into homelessness in the past 10 years as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, thanks to the 'Room for All' hosting scheme set up by the Swindon City of Sanctuary group, a network of host families and individuals stand ready to open their doors for short periods to help these new refugees through their transition to living securely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme has been running for a three month pilot period and is expected to be rolled out on a long term basis soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was during the scheme's pilot period that the single person council tax anomaly emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were concerned they would be asked to pay more in council tax while hosting a refugee,&quot; said SCOS development worker Nicola Wood. &quot;The hosts aren't only helping destitute refugees, they're also reducing the strain on other services at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Initially the council said they would lose the single person discount because of the extra person living there. But now they have decided to change the policy so people can keep it, which is great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will last for three months which is fine because most of the guests don't stay that long. It's normally only a short period of time until they can get an NI number to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new policy, a person receiving a single person discount on their council tax would still be able to claim it if they were hosting a refugee who was in the country legally but who did not have an NI number and the ability to earn their own income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell Holland, deputy leader of Swindon Borough Council and the cabinet member for finance, said: &quot;The UK has a longstanding tradition of assisting refugees and I'm pleased to be able to support people offering a home to a refugee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to thank Coun Paul Dixon for raising this issue. I'm pleased it is receiving support from all political parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coun Dixon (Lab, Eastcott) said: &quot;I contacted Coun Holland to ask for this to be looked into after the SCOS group made me aware of an anomaly in the system which was effectively discouraging single people from doing a charitable act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to thank Coun Holland for recognising this issue and addressing it. And I would particularly like to thank SCOS for drawing this important matter to our attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30th October, over 50 people from a wide range of organisations attended the 'Unlocking the Entrepreneurial Talent of Refugees' conference at the Engine Shed in Bristol.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this event, Ashley Community Housing presented their ground-breaking research project, in collaboration with the Centre for Research in Ethnic Minority Entrepreneurship (CREME). This research revealed some of the opportunities and challenges facing new migrant entrepreneurs, and made recommendations for supporting them. You can read the full or summarised report at http://www.ashleyhousing.com/about-us/research/.<BR><BR>Topics included the valuable economic contribution of migrants to the UK, and the mismatch between their aspirations and reality. From the evidence presented, it was clear that while refugee entrepreneurs have the skill and talent to succeed in growing a business, a number of barriers prevent them from meeting their full potential.<BR><BR>Some of these barriers were identified during the conference, and possible solutions were put forward: such as the need to make mainstream business support more accessible and inclusive, and to develop new methods of accessing finance for refugees. Another focus of the discussion was the communication gap between support services and potential service users, and the ways that providers can effectively reach out to refugee and migrant communities.<BR><BR>Councillor Asher Craig closed the conference by emphasising the need for communication between key organisations, and for clear, practical actions going forward:<BR><BR>&quot;We are committed to making a difference and improving the lives of migrant entrepreneurs. We need actions and purpose.&quot; Cllr. Asher Craig, Deputy Mayor - Communities, Equalities &amp; Public Health, Bristol City Council.<BR><BR>This event was part of ACH's commitment to share their expertise refugee resettlement and integration across the West of England. They look forward to continuing this dialogue with interested parties across the West of England.<BR><BR>&quot;Great discussion about building a more inclusive and diverse business ecosystem in Bristol&quot; Zara Nanu, Gapsquare.<BR><BR>Editor's Notes:<BR><BR>For further information please contact:<BR><BR>Matthew Rogers, Marketing &amp; Communications Officer Email: matthew.rogers@ashleyhousing.com Tel: 0117 941 5339 Website: www.ashleyhousing.com<BR><BR>About Ashley Community Housing<BR><BR>Ashley Community Housing (ACH) was established in 2008 as a social enterprise specialising in the economic, social and civil integration of refugees through accommodation and community based training support.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations migration agency and its partners are rushing to build roads in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar to improve humanitarian access to hilly terrain, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees have settled in makeshift camps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sites where the Rohingyas have settled are desperately overcrowded and located on inhospitable terrain with insufficient drainage and little or no road access, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Friday.<BR><BR>The few roads that exist are impossibly congested, making it extremely difficult to reach refugees with the support and services they need.<BR><BR>Since 25 August, an estimated 613,000 Rohingya refugees have arrived in Cox's Bazar, fleeing violence in Myanmar. The total refugee population in the area is now over 826,000.<BR><BR>IOM is responsible for coordinating site management at a site now home to an estimated 423,000 refugees.<BR><BR>IOM officials said that people hike for hours under the scorching sun, often carrying heavy loads from distribution points, to reach their shelters. Steep hills and dangerous paths mean that children, the elderly and people with disabilities are often unable to move around the site.<BR><BR>In October, IOM built some 850 metres of road into Balukhali to enable humanitarian agencies to deliver lifesaving assistance to at least 50,000 refugees.<BR><BR>&quot;The road has vastly improved access for both refugees and humanitarian actors,&quot; said IOM Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Project Officer Stephen Waswa Otieno.<BR><BR>&quot;Contractors can now deliver materials inside the site, which has allowed us to build new, essential infrastructure. For example, one of our partners has just built a new distribution centre, bringing aid much closer to the families who need it,&quot; he notes.<BR><BR>IOM is currently working on six other projects, providing more access from main roads outside the sites, and inside the sites. It is also building five bridges, which will allow people and vehicles to cross canals and streams in different areas of the sites.<BR><BR>The agency is also working to mitigate the threat of landslides on the newly de-forested land where many of the shelters perch on steep hillsides.<BR><BR>IOM teams have been distributing bags that the refugees can fill with soil and use to create retaining walls and steps. These can also be used to raise shelters off mud floors, helping to keep them dry, especially when flash floods occur. Immunizing new arrivals against measles<BR><BR>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) are stepping up immunization efforts in overcrowded camps and makeshift shelters close to the border with Myanmar in response to an increase in the number of suspected measles cases among the newly arrived Rohingya and their host communities.<BR><BR>&quot;Children are especially at risk from outbreaks of measles and other communicable diseases that result from the crowded living conditions, malnutrition and severe lack of water and sanitation in the camps and other sites,&quot; said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF Bangladesh Representative.<BR><BR>&quot;To halt any wider outbreak, it's essential that coordinated efforts begin immediately to protect as many children as possible.&quot;<BR><BR>The UN agencies and its partners will administer measles and rubella vaccine to nearly 360,000 people in the age group of six months to 15 years among the new Rohingya arrivals in Cox's Bazar and their host communities.<BR><BR>As of 4 November, one death and 412 suspected cases of measles have been reported among the vulnerable populations living in Cox's Bazar.<BR><BR>&quot;As part of stepped up vaccination efforts, 43 fixed health facility sites, 56 outreach vaccination teams and vaccination teams at main border entry points will administer MR vaccine to population aged six months to 15 years,&quot; said WHO Representative to Bangladesh N Paranietharan.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past 10 days, dozens of makeshift rafts carrying more than a thousand people have floated into Bangladesh, proof that Rohingya refugees are resorting to increasingly desperate means to flee to Myanmar, the United Nations refugee agency said Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unable to pay for the crossing, refugees are building rafts from whatever material they can get their hands on - mostly bamboo poles and empty jerry cans tied together with rope and covered with plastic sheets,&quot; William Spindler, spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told reporters at the regular press briefing in Geneva.<BR><BR>&quot;Using paddles made of bamboo and plastic debris some of these rafts made it to Shahporir Dwip in Bangladesh, a journey of about four hours,&quot; he added, pointing out that the Naf river estuary between the two countries is about three kilometres wide at this point.<BR><BR>According to Mr. Spindler, more than 100 Rohingya refugees are known to have drowned in shipwrecks and boat incidents since the start of the crisis on 25 August, and recent arrivals said they had been waiting for more than a month in desperate conditions on Myanmar' shores with food and water running low.<BR><BR>&quot;An estimated 620,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh since 25 August,&quot; the UNHCR spokesperson explained. &quot;The Kutupalong Extension site alone, which was set up soon after the influx began, is now highly congested sheltering some 335,000 new arrivals - more than half of the influx so far.&quot;<BR><BR>Citing UN Habitat data that Dhaka's population density is 44,500 people per square kilometre, UNHCR said 13 out of 20 blocks in the Kutupalong Extension area are more densely populated than parts of the Bangladesh capital city, with an area known as Block CC sheltering more than 95,000 people per square kilometre.<BR><BR>&quot;Despite concerted efforts to deliver more aid and services, the overcrowding and difficult living conditions in the camps and makeshift sites increase health, sanitation and fire risks as well as violence and trafficking,&quot; stressed Mr. Spindler.<BR><BR>Additional land and more space for shelters and infrastructure are needed urgently to provide life-saving services and aid, including water points, latrines and spaces for women and girls.<BR><BR>As high population density also escalates risks, particularly for sexual and gender based violence (SGBV), UNHCR is engaging all segments of the refugee communities to raise awareness.<BR><BR>&quot;Together with our partners, we are working to put in place referral pathways for women, survivors of SGBV, as well as safe spaces for women and girls,&quot; said Mr. Spindler.<BR><BR>Solar-powered healthcare<BR><BR>Meanwhile, the UN International Organization for (IOM) is using solar energy to power its health posts in Kutupalong and Balukali makeshift settlements - now home to an estimated 440,000 Rohingya refugees.<BR><BR>&quot;As the demand for our healthcare services increases, solar-powered lighting means we can provide round the clock emergency consultations and medicine distributions,&quot; said Mariam Abdelkerim-Spijkerman, the IOM Emergency Health Officer in Cox's Bazar.<BR><BR>Prior to the latest refugee influx, in close collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Bangladeshi Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, IOM had been coordinating aid work in the health sector.<BR><BR>As people continue to flood into the settlements, pressure on the health sector has steadily risen.<BR><BR>&quot;The health needs of the refugees are immense - providing 24-hour lighting helps save lives,&quot; explained Ms. Abdelkerim-Spijkerman.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After various court challenges, the Supreme Court last week allowed the restrictive policy on refugees to remain temporarily. The justices will hear arguments on the bans October 10.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the four refugees invited to the home on Saturday, three were from countries listed on the travel ban - two from Somalia, one from Syria. The other is from Vietnam.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We wanted to send a strong message to Trump and world leaders that they must do more to welcome refugees,' said Shannon Scribner, acting director for the humanitarian department of Oxfam America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump lived in the house on a tree-lined street of single-family dwellings until he was about 4, when his family moved to another home his father had built nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an upstairs bedroom, Eiman Ali, 22, looked around at the dark wood floors and a copy of the book 'Trump: The Art of the Deal' on a nearby table and wondered about the home's previous resident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Knowing Donald Trump was here at the age of four makes me think about where I was at the age of four,' said Ali, her smiling face framed by a dark gray hijab. 'We're all kids who are raised to be productive citizens, who have all these dreams and hopes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali was three when she arrived in the United States from Yemen, where her parents had fled when war broke out in their native Somalia. Ali said she remembered Trump as an entertaining character on 'The Celebrity Apprentice,' but has since changed her opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'To have someone so outspoken against my community become the president of the United States was very eye-opening and hurtful because I have invested a lot in this country,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the hall, Ghassan al-Chahada, 41, a Syrian refugee who arrived in the United States with his wife and three children in 2012, sat in a room with bunk beds and a sign on the wall that said it likely was Trump's childhood bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Before the conflict began in Syria we had dreams of coming to America,' al-Chahada said. 'For us it was a dream come true.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Chahada said his life changed when Trump signed the ban that barred people from Syria and five other countries from entering the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I had hopes I would get my green card and be able to visit my country,' al-Chahada said. 'But since Trump was elected I don't dare, I don't dare leave this country and not be able to come back.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He looked out the window into the front yard and thought about what he would say to the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I would advise him to remember, to think about how he felt when he slept in this bedroom,' al-Chahada said. 'If he can stay in tune with who he was as a child, the compassion children have and the mercy, I would say he's a great person.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of refugees at a detention centre set up by Australia in Papua New Guinea were stockpiling rainwater and preparing for attacks by hostile local residents yesterday as soldiers cut off supplies and electricity in an effort to force them to leave.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remote Manus Island camp, set up to hold asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat, was ordered to close by a court in Papua New Guinea, with a deadline set for yesterday. However, the 600 male refugees, mostly from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, have refused to go, saying that they fear for their safety in the nearby town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has refused to admit them and Papua New Guinea insists that it cannot be held responsible for them even though several have been attacked and stabbed by local residents. In May drunken Papua New Guinean soldiers fired bullets into the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday residents, some armed with machetes, stormed the camp and stole air conditioners and furniture after the staff were evacuated and taken back to Australia in the final hours before the deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp is one of two in the Pacific where Australia detains refugees. It does not allow asylum seekers who flee their home nation by boat to set foot on Australian soil. In 2012 Papua New Guinea agreed to host the centre in return for additional Australian aid worth hundreds of millions of pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Papua New Guinean government has tried unsuccessfully to persuade the remaining refugees at the Manus Island camp to move to alternative accommodation on the island. Many have told Australian media that they have been targeted by violent local residents who resent their presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia remains adamant that despite the closure ruling, the 600 men within the centre will never be allowed on Australian soil, saying it has to take a stand to discourage people traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations refugee agency has urged Australia to avert a humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick McKim, an Australian Green senator who is visiting Manus Island, said the closure of the centre and departure of all staff had left the refugees at the mercy of the Papua New Guinean military, with no food or drinking water. He said that 100 local residents had taken to the streets yesterday morning demanding that the refugees be sent to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Lomai, a Papua New Guinean lawyer representing the refugees, was seeking an urgent court order yesterday to ensure that food, water and electricity continue to be provided to the camp while the stand-off continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia and Papua New Guinea both deny ultimate responsibility for the safety of the men who remain inside the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection said the centre's closure and the &quot;management&quot; of the men at the centre were matters for Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, on Monday Petrus Thomas, the Papua New Guinean immigration minister, insisted they were Australia's responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a separate resettlement deal that Australia struck with the Obama administration in 2016, the United States agreed to take some refugees from the Manus Island centre and another camp from the tiny island nation of Nauru. In September a group of about 50 people from the camps were accepted by the US.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A court decision on US president Donald Trump's travel ban has reopened a window for tens of thousands of refugees to enter the United States, and the government is looking to quickly close it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration appealed directly to the US Supreme Court after a federal judge in Hawaii ordered it to allow in refugees formally working with a resettlement agency in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US district judge Derrick Watson also vastly expanded the list of US family relationships that refugees and visitors from six Muslim-majority countries can use to get into the country, including grandparents and grandchildren.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling on Thursday was the latest twist in a long, tangled legal fight that will culminate with arguments before the nation's high court in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could help more than 24,000 refugees who had already been vetted and approved by the United States but would have been barred by the 120-day freeze on refugee admissions, said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, a resettlement agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of them had already sold all of their belongings to start their new lives in safety,&quot; she said. &quot;This decision gives back hope to so many who would otherwise be stranded indefinitely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing a need to review its vetting process to ensure national security, the administration capped refugee admissions at 50,000 for the 12-month period ending September 30, a ceiling it hit this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal budget can accommodate up to 75,000 refugees, but admissions have slowed under Mr Trump, and the government could hold them to a trickle, resettlement agencies say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absolutely this is good news for refugees, but there's a lot of uncertainty,&quot; said Melanie Nezer, spokeswoman for HIAS, a resettlement agency. &quot;It's really going to depend on how the administration reacts to this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney general Jeff Sessions said the administration will ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, bypassing the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which has ruled against it in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court allowed a scaled-back version of the travel ban to take effect last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again, we are faced with a situation in which a single federal district court has undertaken by a nationwide injunction to micromanage decisions of the co-equal executive branch related to our national security,&quot; Mr Sessions said. &quot;By this decision, the district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the executive branch in a time of grave threats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration took a first step by filing a notice of appeal to the 9th Circuit, allowing it to use a rule to petition the high court directly. There is no timetable for the Supreme Court to act, but the administration will be seeking quick action that clarifies the court's June opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justices now are scattered during their summer recess, so any short-term action would come in written filings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration has lost most legal challenges on the travel ban, which applies to citizens of Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court's ruling exempted a large swath of refugees and travellers with a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot; with a person or an entity in the US. The justices did not define those relationships but said they could include a close relative, a job offer or admission to a college or university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trump administration defined the relationships as people who had a parent, spouse, fiance, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling already in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Watson enlarged that group to include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingyas continue to cross over to Bangladesh from Myanmar's Rakhine state, with more than 2,000 having entered the country through different border points last week, according to sources. The International Organization of Migration (IOM) estimates that around 655,000 Rohingyas have crossed the border till 14 December .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khaled Mahmud, additional district magistrate (ADM) of Cox's Bazar district, said: &quot;As Rohingyas are feeling insecure in Rakhine, they are still fleeing to Bangladesh. They are being kept under surveillance and are sometimes even arrested by security forces.&quot; &quot;Some of the new entrants are coming here by following the suggestions of their relatives, who have already fled to Bangladesh,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, as many as 19 diplomats from 15 countries yesterday visited Rohingya refugee camps in Ukhiya upazila of Cox's Bazar district. They visited Balukhali and Kutuplaong Rohingya refugee camps and spoke to the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambassadors are from Austria, Ghana, New Zealand, Bosnia, Portugal, Hercegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Georgia, Egypt, Mauritius, Slovenia, Ukraine, Zambia, Nigeria, Kenya, Fiji and the Czech Republic. The envoys came from New Delhi, as there are no permanent missions of these countries in Bangladesh and they serve Bangladesh from India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've briefed them on the current situation of the Rohingyas. I told them in detail what exactly happened from August 25 till date,&quot; said Ali Hossain, deputy commissioner of the Cox's Bazar district administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They wanted to know about sanitation, drinking water and healthcare of the Rohingyas. I have told them about the steps our government has taken. The Austrian envoy said his government would provide medicines for the Rohingyas,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bangladesh high commissioner to India, Syed Moazzem Ali, and deputy high commissioner Rakib Uddin accompanied the envoys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press briefing on Friday in Geneva, United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesperson Babar Baloch had said they were increasingly worried about the deterioration in the overall situation and the protection of the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children, who account for 55 per cent of the Rohingya refugees, are particularly vulnerable. So are the women who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">represent more than half of the refugees. An estimated 10 per cent are either disabled or have serious medical conditions or older persons who are at risk,&quot; he had added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a report of Department of Health (DoH), it has provided treatment for over 122,519 who suffered cough and cold, 92,534, who had acute diarrhoea, 41,836, who had diarrhoea with blood, 158,989 with fever, and 66,223 children between six months to 59 months who suffered from malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR yesterday began the first phase of distributing almost 200,000 items of warm clothes among the refugees to give then protection against cold in the coming weeks, said the UNHCR statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by right-of-centre German newspaper Die Welt website on 12 October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Report by Robert Alexander: &quot;No diplomat, but expert for refugees&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[German Chancellor Angela] Merkel is getting a new chief foreign policy adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Merkel has filled a core vacancy in the Federal Chancellery. Jan Hecker will be the Leader of Department II, which is responsible for foreign- and security policy, making him chief adviser on foreign policy. The 50-year-old, who seems younger than he is - like many men in Merkel's professional environment - is not a trained diplomat. He was active as a lawyer for the Federal Interior Ministry and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, and then became a judge at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Altmaier, Chief of Staff at the Federal Chancellery, brought him back to the capital from there, to manage the chaos that had developed at the time of the open borders. As the leader of the newly established coordination team on refugee policy, Hecker organized the distribution of hundreds of thousands [of refugees] with a small group of civil servants, lawyers, and officers. This succeeded: No asylum seeker had to go hungry or freeze even in the refugee winter of 2015-2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hecker grew into Merkel's closest circle in spring of 2016. For her, he investigated on the scene in Greece to see how the build-up of the hot spots - the refugee camps run by the EU - was progressing. But above all, he helped prepare the deal with [Turkish President] Recep Tayyip Erdogan for Merkel. To Merkel, the EU-Turkey agreement, very unpopular with the public, is the model for refugee policy in the next few years. There should be deals like this with the North-African countries close to the Mediterranean sea in the future. The fact that Hecker now has all of Department II at his disposal shows how serious Merkel is about this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hecker already made refugee policy 10 years ago when he organised the entry of 2,500 Iraqi Christians in Germany toegther with Altmaier, who was Secretary of State in the Interior Ministry at the time. Hecker signed the order when Altmaier, as Secretary of State, agreed to the transfer of refugees from Malta in 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Hecker was involved in the preparation for the summit of EU heads of state and government about the EU-Turkey deal, he does not show much foreign policy experience in the narrower sense. As a result, his profile is very different from that of his predecessor: Christoph Heusgen, who influenced Merkel's foreign policy throughout the past 12 years, had completed the classic foreign service track. German foreign policy shifted more strongly towards the Federal Chancellery in the period of the euro-crisis and summit diplomacy. Heusgen became more influential than Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle and also represented a strong polar opposite to Westerwelle's successor and predecessor Frank-Walter Steinmeier. For years, Heusgen mostly worked to stabilise the Balkans, above all. In the Merkel era, the German-Polish relations were also better than ever before in German history - until the refugee crisis. Heusgen tried steadfastly to help the post-soviet state in the little country of Moldova onto the road to Europe. Merkel sometimes spoke mockingly of &quot;Heusgen's hobby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His masterpiece was the European reaction to the Russian annexation of the Crimea and the invasion of eastern Ukraine. From Berlin, Merkel tied the entire EU to a regime of sanctions that had been designed by Heusgen. This achieved to goals: The breach of international law was not accepted, and the reaction was clear without sliding into military escalation. Although the sanction policy is unpopular, Merkel has maintains it to this day. Heusgen is transferring to become Ambassador to the United Nations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Turnbull government has moved to water down secrecy provisions that threaten workers in Australia's offshore detention centres with two years prison if they speak out about abuse or neglect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has put forward amendments to the 2015 Australian Border Force Act that will make it easier for social workers, lawyers, nurses and security guards working in Australia's offshore detention centres to talk publicly about the shocking treatment of refugees without being jailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee advocates say it represents a stunning backdown on the government's controversial legislation, arguing the government is only doing so because it is in the middle of a high court challenge against the legislation that it knows it will lose.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Obama administration urged Australia to change offshore detention refugee policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dutton says his amendments simply aim to &quot;clarify&quot; the intent of the government's original legislation - to stop the unauthorised disclosure of information that could harm the national or public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It effectively waters down the bill,&quot; Dr Barri Phatarfod from Doctors 4 Refugees told Guardian Australia. &quot;Dutton and his office argue that it 'clarifies' the intention of the bill, which may well be the case... but it's taken over two years for him to clarify something that he wasn't unaware of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Heads of various peak medical and other professional bodies have been appealing to him since [the legislation was introduced in 2015].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers from the Fitzroy Legal Service, working on behalf of Doctors 4 Refugees, filed a case in the high court last year, challenging section 42 - the secrecy provision - of the Border Force Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Section 42 carries a two-year jail term for any &quot;entrusted person&quot; - anybody who works within the immigration detention system - who makes an &quot;unauthorised disclosure&quot; about conditions in the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They argued the controversial legislation had compromised, and potentially criminalised, the actions of doctors who were only seeking to advance their patients' interests by speaking out publicly on behalf of the refugees and asylum seekers they treated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Turnbull government subsequently removed &quot;health professionals&quot; from the definition of &quot;immigration and border protection workers&quot; but the groups have not dropped the high court challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phatarfod said doctors cannot treat refugees properly if non-health professionals - such as teachers, cleaners, and security guards - are unable to report or share information about refugees because they fear that they, too, could be jailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island asylum seeker death: family want inquest in Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton's amendments mean the secrecy provision will now be &quot;refined&quot; to only apply to information that may compromise Australia's security, defence or international relations, interfere with the investigation of offences, or affect sensitive personal and commercial matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendments will apply retrospectively, dating back to 1 July 2015 when the Border Force Act was enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The retrospective application of the bill will provide the necessary certainty that only information which could harm the national or public interest, if disclosed, is to be protected, and will be regarded as ever having been protected, under the ABF act,&quot; Dutton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will reassure individuals who may otherwise believe they have committed an offence, in circumstances which would not have amounted to an offence under these amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This bill will clarify the intent and refine the operation of the secrecy and disclosure provisions that govern the management of information in my portfolio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It illustrates the fine balance that must be struck in protecting sensitive information while upholding a commitment to open and accountable government.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BOLTON youth organisation is pioneering a way of helping young refugees and asylum seekers to integrate more easily into local life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since July this year, Bolton Lads and Girls Club has been successfully running the RISE project - Refugee, Integration, Support and Engagement - as an extension of its comprehensive services for young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during National Youth Work Week, Karen Edwards, the club's CEO, explained: &quot;Youth work needs to respond to the changing needs of our town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We identified that children and young people seeking refuge and asylum in Bolton are extremely vulnerable and need additional support to do what most of us take for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The RISE project was set up to work with some of the most vulnerable young people in Bolton. All children and young people need support and the opportunity to meet other young people in a safe place, especially those whose first language is not English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The RISE project is a fantastic addition to what we offer young people and we believe it will go from strength to strength.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee and asylum-seeking children in Britain are a very diverse group. Some may arrive in the UK with one or both parents or in the care of older siblings or relatives. Some arrive alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since BLGC employed Refugee Engagement Officer Steve Worden this summer, the club has established a &quot;robust referral system&quot; with key agencies working with refugees across Bolton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include local primary and secondary schools, BRASS (Befriending Refugees and Asylum Seekers), ACIS (Achievement, Cohesion and Integration Service) and The Destitution Centre. RISE also works with local community groups to break down fears that many families have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Worden works directly with the families, to help parents understand where their children can safely go in the evenings and at weekends to mix with other young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I don't see them as refugees. They are just young people. I've been working with refugees and asylum-seeking families in Bolton for a number of years. I recognised, though, that there seemed to be no support for them in the evenings, weekends and school holidays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, more than 70 young people aged from eight to 19 have been referred to RISE, which is funded by the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club helps them integrate by identifying barriers, creating supporting structures for health and wellbeing, helping them develop social skills and educating them in language and cultural norms. This is achieved via various activities, workshops and existing programmes including the National Citizens Programme, employability and football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New families can visit the club, with staff on hand to explain what is on offer. As Beth Maunder, the club's youth project manager, said: &quot;We want to break down barriers for them - and it's working. But we've only scratched the surface so far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the young people involved, the project is very positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eddy, aged 11, is a Year 7 pupil at St Catherine's Academy. He came to Bolton as a refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo four years ago and his first language is Swahili.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The help I have had through the RISE programme has made me very happy,&quot; he said. &quot;It has allowed me to make new friends in the club and the football camp has given me new skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mawazo, aged 18, and her sister Rosine, 17, also from Congo, stated: &quot;We have had help with writing our CVs and opening our first bank accounts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mawazo was also grateful for help getting her National Insurance number and filling in forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdul, aged 16, came to Bolton from Syria around three years ago. He said: &quot;I've received help from Steve with completing my CV and recently I started a motor vehicle course at NACRO, which is helping me gain my first engineering skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mekdes, a 16-year-old female asylum seeker, added: &quot;Going to Bolton Lads and Girls Club over the summer was really important to me as I had nothing else to do and didn't know anyone. It stopped me being lonely.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Cohen</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1006 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 2, 2017 Republican Senators Tom Cotton (AR) and David Perdue (GA) unveiled an immigration bill titled The Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy Act (RAISE Act). While the stated purpose of this bill is to increase skilled immigration to the U.S. and protect the American workforce, it would do neither of these things. Indeed, the effect of this bill would not be neutral - it would do great injury to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This bill purports to completely revise the U.S. immigration system by eliminating ALL family-based legal immigration categories except for spouses and minor children of citizens and permanent residents. Even within this limited category, it would change the cutoff in the definition of a child from 21 to 18 years of age. It includes an extremely limited grandfather provision for applications previously filed by visa applicants in categories which would no longer be included in the immigration law. It adds a new temporary visa category for parents of U.S. citizens, but even if the parents were issued temporary visas to come to the U.S. (for up to 5 years) they would not be authorized to work in the U.S. for that entire period.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The categories of family-based immigration that would be completely eliminated by this bill include parents of U.S. citizens, adult, unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens and their minor children, unmarried sons and daughters of permanent residents, married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, and siblings of U.S. citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill would also completely eliminate the Diversity Visa Program, which grants up to 55,000 immigrant visas each year to people from countries around the world whose countries have been underrepresented in our immigrant pool. The Diversity Visa Program is important because it underscores that we value diversity in our country. Through this program we have welcomed immigrants from around the world who add greatly to our culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill also cuts refugee admissions to 50,000 per year. This is less than half of the number of refugees the United States had agreed to accept in 2016. How we approach refugee admissions and the manner in which we treat those who have fled unspeakable horrors speaks volumes about who we are as a country. Our refugee program is extremely strict and refugees must pass extensive background checks before being approved to come to the U.S. The vetting process typically takes many years. The combination of the moral and policy imperative to welcome refugees along with the strict vetting process that already exists, is a reason to raise, not lower, the number of refugees admitted to the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the bill sets out a points-based system for immigrating to the U.S. that completely ignores the needs and input of U.S. employers. Individuals would have to submit applications claiming how many points they can prove, and only if they meet the threshold number of points to be &quot;selected&quot; by the government to apply for an immigrant visa, would they then submit a letter from a potential U.S. employer to verify that a job is waiting for them. The points that the applicant can prove will also be reduced if the applicant's spouse would not independently meet the threshold number of points to qualify on his or her own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a punitive system and it does not recognize the reality that U.S. employers typically employ foreign workers on temporary work visas, and once these employees have proved themselves in their jobs, the employers sponsor them for permanent status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower-skilled immigrants would have no chance to immigrate to the U.S. unless they had a qualifying family relationship to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Employers of both high-skilled and lower skilled workers care about the value that an employee can add to their organization and deserve a say in the employment-based immigration process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign students and those who have graduated from U.S. colleges and universities are ignored in this bill, as are artists, writers, musicians, entertainers and others who under existing law can immigrate if they can show they have risen to the top of their fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this bill, foreign investors would face a higher investment threshold than exists currently and they would be held to a stricter standard for day-to-day involvement in the companies in which they have invested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the sponsors of the bill have said that its points-based system is modeled on the immigration programs in Australia and Canada, in fact those countries' immigration programs are more generous and both Canada and Australia admit a much larger percentage of immigrants relative to the size of their populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We admit a tiny percentage of new immigrants to the U.S. relative to the size of our population. In 2013, new immigrants to Canada equaled .74 percent of Canada's population. In the same year, new immigrants to Australia equaled 1.1 percent of the population. Yet new immigrants admitted to the U.S. in 2013 accounted for just .31 percent of our population.*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the RAISE Act truly was intended to model Canada's or Australia's skills-based immigration systems, then it would need to increase the number of annual employment-based green cards by many hundreds of thousands of green cards per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This bill would not strengthen the U.S. It would weaken our country by separating families, reducing diversity, and turning away the types of immigrants that enhance our society and our economy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">'Thanks to Guardian readers, many children are now sleeping safely in warm beds'; <BR>Ishmael escaped Calais for security in the UK with the help of Safe Passage, one of three refugee charities supported by Guardian readers in 2016</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amelia Gentleman</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEMBERSHIP; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1276 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last October, Ishmael was one of many despairing migrants living in huts in Calais, risking his life regularly in an attempt to stow away in trucks to get to Britain, depressed to have fled violence in Syria only to find himself stuck in the squalor of the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 18, Ishmael is settled with a foster family in north London and his English - almost non-existent when he left Syria alone aged 15 - is rapidly becoming fluent. He will soon begin a foundation course in politics at Birkbeck, University of London, the recipient of one of the college's Compass scholarships, which provide financial support for asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an incredibly cheering experience to interview him at his new home and hear his optimism and excitement about his future. After reporting from the Calais camp, witnessing the misery of hundreds of teenage refugees who had no idea what was to become of their lives, it is lovely to find someone for whom things have turned out so well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It feels remarkable even to be able to have a conversation with Ishmael in such a normal, stable environment, over late breakfast around the kitchen table, the family dog running around - far from the hunger and cold of Calais.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without the support of Safe Passage, one of three refugee charities supported by the Guardian's readers as part of our 2016 charity appeal, it is unlikely things would have unfolded so positively for Ishmael. This is partly why he wants to talk about his experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spent almost 17 months travelling to Britain, an extraordinary undertaking for a 15-year-old. When it became obvious that his life would be at risk if he stayed in Syria, his mother sold her jewellery to fund his journey. Just two of the 30 children in his school class remain in Syria; the rest are scattered around the world, most in refugee camps in Turkey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not that I've come here in a search of a good life,&quot; Ishmael explains. &quot;I've not come for economic reasons. I had a fantastic life but I would have been killed if I stayed there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His parents, while worried for him, agreed it was the right decision. He tried not to upset them unnecessarily, shielding them from the difficulties of day-to-day life on the road, his fears and mounting unhappiness. Shortly after he arrived in Calais, Ishmael's mobile phone and computer were stolen, so he was unable to contact them for two months. He managed to get someone to send them a text saying: &quot;I've lost my phone; don't worry about me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 14 months he spent in France, Ishmael estimates that he tried to stow away in lorries more than 100 times. Once he even made it on to a boat before being discovered by British ferry workers and sent back to Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last October, as the camp was being demolished around him, the charity Safe Passage told Ishmael they had secured papers for him to be transferred legally to London under the Dubs scheme, created by a legal provision introduced by the Labour peer Alf Dubs to allow for vulnerable unaccompanied refugee children to be brought to Britain. He thought they were lying. &quot;It was such a shock. I thought I was dreaming. Suddenly I forgot all the pain,&quot; he recalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has landed on his feet with a friendly foster family, welcomed by their 14-year-old daughter and 23-year-old son. His perceptions of Britain were vague, formed mostly by watching Britain's Got Talent in Syria before his family were forced to flee from their home in Aleppo to the countryside. Despite knowing little about England, he had an idea that it was a country that respected democratic values and was welcoming towards refugees. He tried to teach himself English as a child, watching Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit in English with subtitles. He is an Arsenal supporter; by extra good fortune his foster family have an Arsenal season ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last December, Guardian readers raised &pound;1.75m, a sum split between three charities supporting refugees: Safe Passage, Help Refugees and the Children's Society. The money that went to Safe Passage has helped the organisation continue its work finding legal ways to bring refugee children to Britain. Only 200 arrived under the Dubs scheme - well short of the 3,000 campaigners had hoped for and 280 short of the government's latest commitment. However, Safe Passage's work has meant that about another 1,000 refugee children have been legally reunited with family in the UK using different legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Ishmael waits to start college, he has been doing work experience with Dubs, whose campaign forced the government to start taking some child refugees from Europe. He has spoken in parliament about his journey, and wants to campaign for the UK to be more open to taking refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having seen the risks of attempting to travel illegally, Ishmael makes a strong case for a legal route. &quot;It was always dangerous. Every attempt you make includes a risk, from the police, from the road, from the driver who may hit you if he sees you,&quot; he says. &quot;That I wasted more than a year trying to get here illegally is very hard to remember.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He worries about his 14-year-old nephew, currently attempting a similar journey, traveling alone through Europe in an attempt to find safety. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest of a Syrian refugee over the Parson's Green tube bombing last month has worsened attitudes towards refugees in Britain. Ishmael, surrounded by supportive new friends, says he has not experienced hostility, but feels a responsibility to fight prejudice: &quot;I want to make people feel positive about refugees,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His only frustration with his new country is focused on the Home Office and the delayed response to his application to stay, which almost jeopardised his course at Birkbeck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager would liketo return home eventually, but only if President Bashar al-Assad and Isis are defeated. He doesn't know if his home in Aleppo is still standing. In the meantime he wants to study and then work in the UK; he plans to go to King's College London next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Griffiths, who manages casework for Safe Passage, describes the enormous relief she felt that Ishmael managed to get to the UK legally. &quot;I first met Ishmael in Calais in October 2016. His was a particularly striking case as he had been travelling for so long, from such a young age,&quot; she says. &quot;Life in the Calais camp was always chaotic, but at that time it was particularly unstable; reports of the imminent demolition meant children were scared, and Safe Passage were trying to work on as many cases as possible to transfer children out of the camp.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has been impressed at Ishmael's readiness to campaign for others in a similar situation. &quot;Since he has been here, he has been involved in Safe Passage's advocacy programme, meeting MPs and raising awareness about the importance of establishing safe routes for child refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Clark, bishop of Croydon and chairman of Safe Passage, notes that the charity's work has been able to continue because of Guardian readers' support. &quot;We are enormously grateful to the readers of the Guardian, who have helped us transform the lives of hundreds of young people,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks to your generosity, we were able to respond to the growing number of unaccompanied children arriving in Italy earlier this year; we have started to establish inter-Europe family reunion, helping unaccompanied children to reunite with their families across Europe; and we have begun to extend our work beyond Europe.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donations allowed for an expansion of the team who support new arrivals in the UK, he says. &quot;Thanks to your readers, many children are now sleeping safely and securely in warm beds, and many more will not have to risk their lives trying to reach sanctuary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration urged Australia to change its policy of offshore detention of refugees while agreeing to accept up to 1,200 people to relieve their suffering, a former senior US official has said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former US deputy secretary of state Heather Higginbottom, who negotiated the deal designed to take refugees from offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru, makes the revelation in a Time magazine article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higginbottom penned the article to address the leak of the full transcript of the phone conversation between US president, Donald Trump, and the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, about the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Iraqi and Syrian refugees will be settled in Armidale from next year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the January phone call Turnbull persuaded Trump to honour the Obama-era agreement, despite protestations from the president it was a &quot;stupid&quot; deal that would &quot;kill&quot; him politically. Turnbull also falsely claimed that people held in Australia's offshore detention centres were &quot;economic refugees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higginbottom said the refugees were &quot;people who risked their lives on makeshift boats to flee conflict and the lack of access to basic means of survival but were turned back by an Australian government that refuses asylum seekers who arrive by sea&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the last administration strongly pressed the Australian government to change its policy toward asylum seekers, we also sought to immediately relieve the suffering of these refugees and agreed to resettle up to 1,200 after they went through the US government's rigorous refugee screening processes,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higginbottom, who is now the chief operating officer of the aid organisation Care, singled out the &quot;policy of detention&quot; as the aspect of Australia's policy rejected by the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higginbottom lamented that coverage of the Turnbull-Trump phone call had focused on personalities and not that &quot;the wellbeing of 2,000 actual human beings hangs in the balance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has called Australia's policy of offshore detention of asylum seekers unjustifiably punitive and unlawful, &quot;cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia is once again a frightened country. We need to reconstruct our values | Anne Summers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the leaked phone call, Turnbull told Trump that Australia had &quot;taken a very strong line on national security and border protection&quot; and said that he, Jared Kushner and a White House immigration adviser had &quot;reflected on how our policies have helped to inform your approach... We are very much of the same mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull noted that Trump, who has attempted to ban immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries, prioritised &quot;minorities&quot; in his executive order and linked it to the fact 90% of the 12,000 refugees Australia had accepted from Syria were Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull explained that Australia turned back boats at sea and sent asylum seekers to offshore detention &quot;not because they are bad people&quot; but rather to prevent people-smugglers of a &quot;product&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said people who came by boat would not be let in even if they were a Nobel prize-winning genius, which prompted Trump to say &quot;that is a good idea&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should do that too,&quot; he said. &quot;You are worse than I am.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull referred to a speech he gave to the UN in September claiming that Australia's harsh treatment of refugees was necessary to control its borders and maintain support for its regular migration intake.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOOTBALL master classes, organised by Notts County's charity arm to help young refugees integrate into society, have been held at Nottingham College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The free weekly sessions are designed to help people learn social skills and improve their English, as well as getting fit and meeting new friends.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of six sessions was held today at the college's Maid Marian Way campus, and Football in the Community's Tim Hatton said the classes gave a real boost to the youngsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;About two-and-a-half years ago, when there was a lot of coverage about refugees in the media and on the news, we thought that we could do something because we knew there were a few thousands refugees in Nottingham. We help people from all over the world, and even if they can't speak much English, they can all play football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The goal of our charity is to reach out to people - many of whom are vulnerable - who may feel isolated and not welcome in society. By doing what we can to show people that they have a place and value in society, it can greatly transform and have a positive impact on people's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our project helps refugees and asylum seekers feel at home in Nottingham and welcomed by their local football club. As it's a universal language, we use football as a magnet and have a wider impact, such as improving refugees' physical and mental health, as well as ensuring they feel less isolated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Thompson, Nottingham College's wellbeing co-ordinator for enrichment, said: &quot;It's so important for us to give students, who come from many countries from all around the world, as many opportunities as possible and to try to remove any barriers that might be in their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With our learners, it's sometimes a language barrier, a confidence issue, transport or other costs and a number of other issues. However, having these free sessions on site hopefully starts to remove a number of barriers. They can also feel comfortable being in a safe environment with students they may or may not already know. They laugh, get active and even meet new friends. They will even learn skills in sport they often don't even realise they're learning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special refugee project has been organised in partnership with the British Red Cross and Nottingham Refugee Forum and is enabling up to 25 students a session to learn a variety of professional skills from expert coaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senay Zelizhi, 16,  a refugee studying English as a secondary language at  the college, who has a passion for football and plays on the wing, said: &quot;The main challenge of living in Nottingham is the language barrier and making friends who don't speak the same language. My communication skills are improving, though, and making life easier. Sometimes I feel a bit sad and worried about my family back home but when playing football, I forget about it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When playing football, I feel free and happy and I love to score and win. The football group is helping me to become more confident. It's also very useful, as I don't have enough English or enough skills and I want to make friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than three quarters of child refugees trying to reach Europe are facing &quot;appalling&quot; levels of human rights abuses alongthe central Mediterranean route, a new study has revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of nearly 1,600 child refugees aged 14-17 who came to Italy through the Mediterranean during the second half of 2016,77 per cent reporteddirect experiences of abuse, exploitationandpracticeswhich may amount to human trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survey results from early 2017, based on the testimonies of some 22,000refugees, indicate that the situation might be worsening -withl per cent of children reportingsuch experiences.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Number of child refugees in Greek detention rises 'alarmingly'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns raised over Government's treatment of refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 child refugees missing in UK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, co-producedbyUnicef, the International Office for Migration (IOM) and the UN Migration Agency, shows that children and young people on the move are nearly twice as likely to experience exploitation and trafficking than adults aged 25 years and above on the eastern Mediterranean route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One 17-year-old Nigerian girl reported being raped and held prisoner in a house in Tripoli, before being threatened once she sought help. An Afghanboy, 16, reported being forced to work on a farm in Libya, where he was &quot;beaten with a cane&quot; if he stopped working, to pay hissmugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children and youths travelling alone or over longer periods, as well as those possessing lower levels of education, were also found to be highly vulnerable to exploitation at the hands of traffickers and criminal groups over the course of their journeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the reportthe central Mediterranean route is particularly dangerous, with most of the refugees passing through Libya, which remains riven with lawlessness, militias and criminality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes amid a surge in the number of youngsters pursuing routes to Europe in recent years, with at least 300,000 unaccompanied and separated children moving across borders having registered in 80 countries last year - a near fivefold increase from 66,000 in 2010-2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unaccompanied and separated children made up 92 per cent of all under-18sarriving in Italy viathe central Mediterranean Sea passage from North Africa in 2016, and the figure remained at this level through the first two months of 2017 -up from 75 per cent the year before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 child refugees missing in UK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of these children came from Eritrea, the Gambia, Nigeria, Egypt and Guinea. Ninety-two per cent of children who arrived in Italy in 2016 and the first two months of 2017 were unaccompanied -up from 75 per cent in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children indicated that they had been held against their will or forced to work - or had agreed to work for pay, and then were not paid. A smaller number told researchers they had been offered arranged marriage or cash for blood, organs or body parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smugglers may offer refugees, including children moving on their own, a &quot;pay as you go&quot; deal - asking for no money up front, but later demanding sums children may not be able to pay. Children may subsequently be forced to work off their &quot;debts&quot; under conditions akin to contemporary forms of slavery and under threats of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to researchers at a shelter in Italy, 16-year-old Aimamo, an unaccompanied child from the Gambia, described being forced into months of gruelling manual labour by traffickers following his arrival in Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you try to run, they shoot you. If you stop working, they beat you. We were just like slaves. At the end of the day, they just lock you inside,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another youngster, 17-year-old Mary* from Nigeria, told of how she left her country to escape a life with no prospects, but found herself being sexually exploited at the hands of a man who had promised to help her.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man threatened to hand her over to someone else and leave her in Libya, then raped her. She was then held prisoner in a house in Tripoli with several other girls and young women, deprived of food and with no one to contact for help. &quot;I wanted to get away, but I couldn't - I had no money, no phone. I didn't even know where I was to escape,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karim, 16, from Afghanistan, ran out of money while on his way to Europe, so to fund his journey he spent eight months making T-shirts and pants for a textile manufacturer in Istanbul, Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was &quot;backbreaking work&quot;, the report states, requiring him to lift crates weighing 40-50 kg. He worked 14- to 15-hour days six days a week until he earned the 3,000 euros he needed to move on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings reveal there are racial trends in the exploitation of unaccompanied minors, with those originating from sub-Saharan Africa being considerably more at risk.Racism is likely a major underlying factor behind this discrepancy, according to researchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children from sub-Saharan Africa were more than four times more likely to experience exploitation and trafficking than those from other parts of the world along the Eastern Mediterranean route -at 65 per cent compared withl per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discrepancy also exists along the central Mediterranean route, with 83 per cent of sub-Saharan African children subject to exploitation or trafficking, compared withl per cent of others.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child refugees in northern France 'facing exploitation on daily basis'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report has prompted renewed calls forall concerned parties - countries of origin, transit and destination, the African Union, the EU, international and national organisations with support from the donor community - to prioritise a series of actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include establishing safe and regular pathways for children on the move,strengthening services to protect refugee children, finding alternatives to the detention of children on the move,working across borders to combat trafficking and exploitation,and combating xenophobia, racism and discrimination against all refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the findings, Afshan Khan, Unicef Regional Director and Special Coordinator for the Refugee and Migrant Crisis in Europe, urged EU leaders to establish protections for child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stark reality is that it is now standard practice that children moving through the Mediterranean are abused, trafficked, beaten and discriminated against,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;EU leaders should put in place lasting solutions that include safe and legal migration pathways, establishing protection corridors and finding alternatives to the detention of migrant children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugenio Ambrosi, IOM's Regional Director for the EU, Norway and Switzerland, said: &quot;For people who leave their countries to escape violence, instability or poverty, the factors pushing them to migrate are severe and they make perilous journeys knowing that they may be forced to pay with their dignity, their wellbeing or even their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without the establishment of more regular migration pathways, other measures will be relatively ineffective. We must also re-invigorate a rights-based approach to migration, improving mechanisms to identify and protect the most vulnerable throughout the migration process, regardless of their legal status.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lily Caprani, Deputy Executive Director of Unicef UK, saidBritain has a &quot;crucial&quot; role to play, saying: &quot;This is a global problem but the UK has a crucial role to play in preventing such dangerous and traumatising journeys in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are serious about protecting these children, the UK must change its own family reunion rules so that children do not have to attempt to reach Europe to be reunited with loved ones. This simple move could save lives, and avoid children falling into the hand of traffickers and smugglers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvey Kaplan, director of the Scottish Jewish Archives Centre, has uncovered the stories of refugees who came to Scotland in the 1930s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a number of them made their way to Ayrshire to start new lives, leaving behind the unspeakable atrocities committed by Hitler's Third Reich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many came on the Kindertransport, an organised rescue effort that took place in the months leading up to the war, with 10,000 children helped out of Nazi-occupied countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an Ayrshire Post report from April 1939 - five months before the outbreak of war - Mrs D F Fulton of the Carrick Lodge said: &quot;Already five refugees had been accommodated through there efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayrshire Post photographer helps save 50 refugees from death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a young woman, a doctor and his wife, a young man who had been in a concentration camp and an eight-year-old girl and more were expected in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She made an appeal for offers of hospitality to the refugees and also for enquiries for domestics. Children's clothing was also urgently required.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lore Zimmermann was one of the refugees who came to Scotland, aged 8. She had fled from Thuringia in Germany to Prague because her parents were communists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was one of 669 Czech children from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia rescued by British stockbroke Nicholas Winton during the nine months before war broke out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lore was taken in by Colonel Claud Hamilton and his wife Veronica at Rozelle House in Ayr, who had already helped an Austrian Jewish doctor and his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susanne Schaeffer, a 12-year-old Jewish girl from Berlin, also came to Rozelle House and the Hamiltons found work for her mother Steffie who was then able to come and take up a housekeeping position with a family in Alloway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susanne wrote of her memories of Ayr: &quot;I stayed in Wellington School for one year, by which time I spoke good English and could managew the co-ed Ayr Academy, where I was very happy for four years or so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MP praises the Ayrshire community for reacting to international crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hamiltons were also involved in helping 12-year-old Martha Rosenzweig from the Rhineland find refuge in Minishant. Other refugees in Ayrshire included Herbert Koniec, who fled from Bratislava to Glasgow in 1939 aged just 10, and was evacuated to Kirkmichael where he attended Carrick Academy in Maybole, before going on to study medicine at Glasgow University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ayrshire Post cutting that revealed the part Ayr played in helping Jewish refugees was given to the Archives Centre by the family of Dorrith Sim, who came to Scotland in 1939 and made a new life for herself in Scotland, settling in Prestwick and speaking in schools about her experiences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">896 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GENEVA, Switzerland -- A study of mixed refugee and migrant flows by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has found that around half of those travelling to Libya do so believing they can find jobs there, but end up fleeing onwards to Europe to escape life-threatening insecurity, instability, difficult economic conditions plus widespread exploitation and abuse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign nationals going to Libya are part of mixed migration flows, meaning that people with different backgrounds and motivations travel together along the same routes, often with the help of ruthless people smugglers and criminal gangs. They include refugees, asylum seekers, economic migrants, unaccompanied minors, environmental migrants, victims of trafficking and stranded migrants, among others.<BR><BR>In recent years, the number of people crossing by sea from North Africa to southern Europe has increased. The indications are that this trend is likely to continue. Of the three main routes used by refugees and migrants to reach Europe -- the Western Mediterranean route, the Central Mediterranean route and the Eastern Mediterranean route-- Libya has become the most commonly used one, and also the deadliest.<BR><BR>The study commissioned by UNHCR found that the profiles and nationalities of people arriving in Libya have been evolving over the past few years, with a marked decrease in those originating in East Africa and an increase in those from West Africa, who now represent well over half of all arrivals to Europe through the Central Mediterranean route from Libya to Italy (over 100,000 arrivals in 2016).<BR><BR>According to the study, refugees and migrants in Libya are predominantly young men (80%), aged 22 on average and travelling alone (72%). Women tend to transit towards Europe over a short period of time and many of them, particularly those from West and Central Africa, are victims of trafficking. The number of unaccompanied and separated children travelling alone is rising, and now represents some 14% of all arrivals in Europe via the Central Mediterranean route. These children come mainly from Eritrea, The Gambia and Nigeria.<BR><BR>Refugees and migrants in Libya tend to have a low level of education, with 49% having little or no formal education and only 16% having received vocational training or higher education. They come from diverse backgrounds but can be grouped into four different categories:<BR><BR>Nationals of neighbouring countries (Niger, Chad, Sudan, Egypt and Tunisia). Most of them report travelling to Libya for economic reasons, and many engage in seasonal, circular or repetitive migrations.<BR><BR>Nationals of West and Central Africa countries : mainly from Nigeria, Guinea, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, The Gambia, Senegal, Ghana, Mali and Cameroon. They report having left largely for economic reasons. Some are victims of trafficking, in particular Nigerian and Cameroonian women, and some might be in need of international protection.<BR><BR>Nationals of Eastern Africa countries: from Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan. They reported making the journey for a range of reasons, including political persecution, conflict and poverty in their countries of origin.<BR><BR>Individuals from other regions: Syrians, Palestinians, Iraqis, Moroccans, Bangladeshis and others. Some flee conflict and violence while others are looking for livelihood opportunities.<BR><BR>The study examined the changing dynamics and protection challenges affecting mixed migration flows to and within Libya and the evolution of migration trends, smuggling networks and routes. It also mapped out refugee and migrant communities, focusing on the situation in the south of the country.<BR><BR>In addition to Libya's strategic location, the conflict and instability in the country have contributed to create an environment where human smuggling and criminal networks flourish. At the same time, the collapse of the justice system and reigning impunity have led many armed groups, criminal gangs and individuals to participate in the exploitation and abuse of refugees and migrants.<BR><BR>The study was commissioned by UNHCR and done by Altai Consulting, a specialised consulting firm that focuses on research, monitoring and evaluation in fragile states; together with IMPACT Initiatives, a Geneva-based think-tank that assesses, monitors and evaluates aid programmes. The report's findings are primarily based on qualitative data - including interviews with refugees and migrants - collected in Libya, Algeria, Chad, Italy, Niger and Tunisia, between October and December 2016.<BR><BR>UNHCR is seeking to expand its activities in Libya to meet the increased humanitarian and protection needs of refugees, asylum seekers and Libyans affected by the ongoing conflict. It recently issued a funding appeal for US$ 75.5 million to strengthen protection monitoring and interventions in Libya, as well as advocacy on issues related to respect for human rights, access to basic services, asylum procedures and freedom of movement. UNHCR is also multiplying efforts in Libya and the neighbouring countries to provide credible alternatives, find durable solutions and establish legal pathways for refugees and asylum seekers, as an alternative to dangerous trips to Libya or over the Central Mediterranean Sea to Europe.<BR><BR>Link to the report:www.UNHCR.org/595a02b44.<BR><BR>Distributed by APO on behalf of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stood defiant in the face of the police's powerful water cannons as they were cleared from a piazza near Termini station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees occupied Indipendenza square in Rome in defiance of an order to leave an adjacent office building where as many as 800 had been squatting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials defended the decision to evict them, saying they refused to move to accommodation provided for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV footage showed some of the refugees - many from Eritrea - screaming and trying to hit police who were armed with batons and shields.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The square, just one block from Rome's main train station, was strewn with mattresses, overturned rubbish bins and broken plastic chairs.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hung on the building they once occupied was a sheet with the words, 'we are refugees, not terrorists', in Italian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police began clearing the building at dawn Saturday in the latest of several such operations as the city struggles to find accommodation for new migrants.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) voiced 'grave concern' over the mass eviction - a sign of the country's growing frustration at Europe's migrant crisis.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said 200 of those expelled from the building were forced to sleep on the streets in a city already home to hundreds of homeless refugees who fled persecution and war, including many children.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentators interpreted the unexpected eviction - carried out when Rome was virtually deserted - as a sign of hardening attitudes in Italy towards asylum seekers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 600,000 migrants have landed in Italy since 2014 - with more than 14,000 perishing on the treacherous route across the Mediterranean - but the country has seen a sharp fall in those arriving this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 13,500 have arrived in Italy since July 1, compared to 30,500 over the same period in 2016, a year-on-year fall of more than 55 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy's reception facilities are still under massive strain and the centre-left government, facing elections next year, is under pressure on the issue.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June. Italy threatened to close its ports to aid groups rescuing migrants &nbsp;off Libya's coast with its representative to the EU, Maurizio Massari, saying the situation 'had become unsustainable'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 10,000 refugees tried to cross the Mediterranean in just four days that month, Italy's  former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said citizens were 'exasperated'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interior Minister Marco Minniti, who has ultimate responsibility for Saturday's eviction, has recently overseen a series of controversial moves aimed at ending the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include steps to curb the activity of charity and other privately-funded boats rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean and Italian naval support for Libyan coastguard efforts to intercept boats headed for Europe.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month,&nbsp;deputy foreign minister Mario Giro announced Italy is pushing for centres for refugees to be set up in Libya which could provide safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giro said: 'We are working on it, but it's difficult... We need funds, agreements with the authorities and access to the country.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is launching a supplementary appeal for an additional $ 9.5 million to scale up its activities in north-east Nigeria, as a result of an unexpected surge in self-organized returns of Nigerian refugees since the beginning of the year, mainly from Cameroon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a new emergency, which requires urgent attention. Many of these returnees are unable to go back to their homes due to security concerns and end up being displaced again, in dire humanitarian conditions. Even if UNHCR does not promote or facilitate these returns, we must do everything we can to assist these vulnerable people,&quot; said Volker T&uuml;rk, UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner for Protection.<BR><BR>Many returnees stay in camps and displacement sites in precarious and overcrowded conditions. The situation is particularly difficult in the town of Banki, in north-east Nigeria, where many are forced to live outdoors and have limited access to drinking water, food and medicine.<BR><BR>&quot;During my recent visit to the region, I was not only appalled by the scale of the humanitarian needs, but also deeply shocked at the level of trauma, social division and distrust,&quot; said T&uuml;rk, who visited both Nigeria and Cameroon over the past three weeks.<BR><BR>&quot;We urge the international community to pay more attention to this highly complex and challenging humanitarian and security situation,&quot; said the UNHCR official.<BR><BR>As vulnerabilities increase over time, funding is, unfortunately, lagging behind needs. So far, UNHCR has received $ 41.1 million from donors out of a total funding requirement of $ 179.5 million for 2017 for Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad.<BR><BR>&quot;The current funding for the relief effort does not do justice to the exceptional hospitality offered by host governments and communities,&quot; said Valentin Tapsoba, Director of UNHCR's Regional Bureau for Africa, during a donor briefing on the Nigeria situation on 24 July, 2017.<BR><BR>Additional funding would allow UNHCR to increase its presence in border locations and improve border and protection monitoring. The UN Refugee Agency also plans to expand reception facilities and launch mass information campaigns to ensure that Nigerian refugees in Cameroon's Far North have accurate and updated information on the situation prevailing in areas of return in Nigeria.<BR><BR>&quot;In my recent discussions with both Governments, I also stressed the need to set up a mechanism that can both address legitimate security concerns and the protection needs of refugees,&quot; he added. &quot;I received assurances that action had been taken to stop involuntary returns, an issue that has been of deep concern to UNHCR,&quot; said T&uuml;rk.<BR><BR>&quot;The first meeting of the Tripartite Commission which is expected to take place early August will be a positive step forward,&quot; he added. The Commission was set up after the signature, last March, of a tripartite agreement between UNHCR, Nigeria and Cameroon on voluntary repatriation of Nigerian refugees once conditions are conducive.<BR><BR>Between January and June 2017, nearly 135,000 refugees returned to Nigeria, mainly women and children. The majority left Minawao and Kolofata refugee settlements, in the Far North Region of Cameroon.<BR><BR>UNHCR is helping to respond to the needs of more than 2.5 million people who have become refugees, internally displaced or returnees across the Lake Chad region as a result of armed conflict.<BR><BR>Distributed by APO on behalf of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEREVER there's talk of the UK giving refugees shelter, there can be found many a person saying things along the line of &quot;why don't you take one in then?&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fran and Martin Wood did just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Darlington couple have long been vocal on the subject of the UK doing what it can - and should - to help mitigate the refugee crisis that has seen millions of people displaced in recent years as a result of war, persecution and conflict overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have played a key role in helping Syrian refugees settle into Darlington, helping to found Darlington Assistance for Refugees (DAR) and most recently, opening their door to 25-year-old refugee Mouhyedin Alkhelil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young Syrian came to Darlington after being selected to move to the UK by the UN as part of a resettlement programme. He sees himself as an anomaly - young, single men are rarely selected for such programmes and many of his friends were left to go it alone in war zones, to undertake perilous journeys in the hope of achieving a security few will find.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mouhyedin, it seems, has found some semblance of security with the Woods, in the embrace of their family and wider community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for a great many refugees, the lives they must live are bleaker than most of us could ever imagine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOUHYEDIN'S was a story I have wanted to tell for several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Woods, however - and I'm sure they won't mind me saying so - had reservations over working with me to build relationships between the Echo and Darlington's Syrian families, and by extension, bridges between those families and the wider community as represented by our readership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They feared - with good reason - that hostility and abuse towards vulnerable people would follow any article. They weren't wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days after we went to print, I watched with dismayed resignation as Mouhyedin took to the internet time and time again to defend himself. In turn, Fran and Martin faced a tirade of scorn and derision, repeatedly asked why they didn't help &quot;our homeless&quot;, a question that becomes redundant when you consider that the type of person willing to take in any stranger is almost certainly the kind of person already playing an active part in their community, as is the case with the Woods whose sympathy doesn't begin and end at Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fran, Martin and Mouhyedin faced exactly the kind of abuse that they were expecting, but in allowing me to tell their story, they put a human face to a crisis many feel distant from, and disrupted damaging stereotypes by introducing a new perspective from close to home. Stories like theirs will always be worth telling because they show the potential for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those at the extreme end of the political spectrum and those content to wallow in prejudice will remain unchanged, or strangely emboldened, by the story of the Woods and their new friend. But if by sharing Mouhyedin's experiences, just one person is inspired to reconsider their views by imagining their own loved ones forced to flee war, then that's one more step towards a community defined by understanding, rather than hate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of refugees are facing a severe lack of sanitation and police brutality on the border between Italy and France, in what experts say is a situation &quot;worse than the Jungle&quot;, The Independent can reveal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 700 displaced people, including scores of unaccompanied children, are currently sleeping rough in the Italian city of Ventimiglia, in conditions that are &quot;wholly inadequate&quot;, with an &quot;acute&quot; lack of clean drinking water or sanitation facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New research seen exclusively by The Independent reveals that intensified brutality from Italian and French police and a total lack of accessible healthcare means young refugees also face an &quot;alarming&quot; level of danger coupled with dwindling levels of physical and mental health, with the majority of people unable to access medical care.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers from the Refugee Rights Data Project (RRDP), who carried out the study, said Ventimiglia was one of the worst refugee locations they had been to, describing the situation as &quot;terrifying&quot; and urging that more must be done to improve the inhumane situation. The in-depth study surveyed 150 male refugees in the area, one-in-five respondents of whom was under the age of 18, and 90 per cent were there alone without friends or family members. The majority (73 per cent) had been in Ventimiglia for between one and three months at the time of the study, after arriving in Libya and travelling through Italy. The largest country group were from Sudan, followed by individuals from Chad, Ethiopia and Eritrea. The absence of women and girls reflects the very small number of female refugees, which researchers said could be attributed to the extent of sex trafficking in southern Italy and North Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes dubbed the &quot;Italian Calais&quot;, Ventimiglia is a well-known transit point for refugees and displaced people trying to enter France. A bottleneck has developed there in recent years since France declared a state of emergency and closed its borders in 2015, making passage more difficult. The closed border means displaced people are making fewer attempts to reach France by train, instead taking their chances with the so called &quot;Pass of Death&quot; through the mountains, or walking through motorway tunnels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While 400 to 500 displaced people were hosted in a refugee camp run by the Red Cross camp, a lack of capacity at the camp means an estimated 200 to 300 individuals were destitute at the time of the study, sleeping rough under bridges and by the riverbank, researchers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When questioned about the sanitation in Ventimiglia, the majority of respondents - 85 per cent - said they would use the water in the river, where many go to the toilet, to wash themselves, as well as to drink when desperate. Six-in-10 respondents said they had experienced health problems since arriving in Italy, with 44 per cent of those believing the health problem had started due to the unhealthy living conditions. Local health care professionals reported a large number of dermatological conditions, including scabies, were widespread due to the unhealthy living conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the scale of both physical and mental health problems among refugees in Venitimiglia, researchers found that only 15 per cent of those with health problems had been able to access medical care - despite efforts by groups such as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res. Nearly one-in-five (17 per cent) respondents described their health problem as a mental health issue rather than a physical ailment. The vast majority of sufferers had travelled through Libya, and many recounted highly alarming experiences, while others were left with physical injuries that they could not get treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Sudanese man explained that he had lost his brother at sea when their vessel sank, and that he witnessed an infant being shot by Libyans while in his mother's arms in the boat. Another man said he was feeling unwell because he had bad memories seeing hundreds of fellow refugees shot dead in Libya. There had been some 450 of them to begin with but only himself and 70 others managed to survive. While all of the Red Cross camp residents interviewed said they had access to food every day, just 41 per cent of the destitute refugees said they had food every day. Seventy per cent of those with access to food said they could only have one meal per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of safety, the study found that seven-in-10 respondents said they &quot;didn't feel safe at all&quot; in the region. Researchers put this sense of being in danger down to the absence of security measures, as well as &quot;detrimental&quot; living conditions on the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others said they feared being robbed or attacked by other displaced people due to the precarious context, while almost one in 10 cited the risk of violence or sexual abuse by police or Europeans. When asked about the biggest risks faced by people passing through Ventimiglia, the vast majority cited dangers related to border crossings (75 per cent), followed by the risk of not having access to sufficient food and water (63 per cent) or medical help (51 per cent). Alarmingly, 43 per cent of respondents knew of at least one refugee who had died in Italy or at the French border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers state that while it should be acknowledged that many of these respondents were referring to the same incidents, it is worrying that seven in 10 of these respondents said the persons in question had died by falling down a cliff or mountain when trying to cross the border. Thirty-seven per cent cited road accidents as the reason for death, while some 10 per cent of respondents cited health problems as the cause, eight per cent said the death had occurred as a result of violence by the police and three per cent said the death was caused by suicide. The report found that as well as the physical dangers of crossing the border, police brutality was a major danger to refugees, with more than half (53 per cent) of respondents having experienced violence by French police at the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of this was in the form of verbal abuse but 40 per cent of people had also been subjected to physical violence, 36 per cent tear gas, and eight individuals said they had been subject to some form of sexual abuse. Many respondents recalled being exposed to tear gas at the border. One 18-year-old from Sudan told researchers: &quot;When I was crossing the border they caught me and they beat me and they sprayed tear gas. It was the worst thing in the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Sudanese 18-year-old said: &quot;My right shoulder was broken and my neck was injured by French police at the border. There was the French army deporting people as well. In Ventimiglia my nose was broken by Italian police at the train station. I was sent back many times to Taranto, I don't feel safe in Italy at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many respondents also said they were subject to regular racial verbal abuse from local people, were facing discrimination for being black and were told they were not welcome. Several refugees reported, on separate occasions, that citizens had thrown buckets of water onto them from their balconies as they walked past on the pavement, while others recounted being denied drinking water in the city centre because they were refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report stated that French CRS riot police are present at Ventimiglia train station on a daily basis, searching trains and carrying out detentions. Recently imposed anti-terror protocols give French police the power to conduct searches up to 20km inside Italy, and to deport individuals across the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marta Welander, executive director of the RRDP, who has carried out a large number of refugee research projects, told The Independent the accumulation of issues facing refugees in Ventimiglia was &quot;terrifying&quot;, and said it was &quot;one of the worst&quot; research locations she had been to. &quot;Of course the Greek islands are also horrendous and at breaking point but what's so alarming about this situation is the lack of available services,&quot; she said. &quot;It's really trapping people in this bottleneck scenario but without any access to the services they need. There are charities there, and they are doing what they can, but there's such a lack of resources and they're being restrained by the authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Welander accused the authorities of &quot;resisting&quot; providing help for refugees, and said the French police had been acting illegally by sending children out of the country, despite it being a legal obligation for the state to care for them. &quot;The French authorities are breaking European directives and are sending kids back from French soil. Once they've already arrived, they should become the responsibility of the French state. This is illegal as far as all of us understand,&quot; she said. &quot;We overheard the French police giving children false information. They told them absolute nonsense. They asked if they were European and when they said no they said, 'Well then you can't stay in France, don't you know the rules'. The French are a huge part of this problem. They are abusing state-of-emergency powers laws by sending back these kids. No one wants to take responsibility for minors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said the Italian authorities had put many refugee families in danger by closing down a church in the city that could host women and children, which she said led to many women and children simply disappearing. &quot;This is infuriating. That was a safe space for women and children. The local authorities wanted to move them to the Red Cross camp, where there are about 400 men and no security and known for its precarity. So a lot of them fled and no one knows where they went. The authorities really don't have the best interests of these people at heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Welander went on to say that the dangers and health risks for refugees on the Italian border was more severe than they were in the Jungle camp before it was demolished by the authorities in October last year. &quot;It's worse than the Jungle. All the positive elements that people could draw from that camp, such as support networks, makeshift health services and a sense of community, simply aren't there. It's much like the way the French authorities are now dealing with the situation in Calais. They're constantly trying to make sure that people don't set up camp and stabilise themselves there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are arriving straight from Libya and a lot of them have experiences of horrendous things there, and then they find themselves in destitution. I got the sense that people are not entirely informed as to why the border is closed and why they can't choose where they apply for asylum. It seems quite clear that the current policies are not doing anything to address the situation in a meaningful or long-term way. They're just shifting people around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are people who are highly likely to be developing post-traumatic stress disorder because of what they lived through in Libya. It's in everyone's interest to provide support or medical care. Whether they're staying in Italy or not, there need to be better services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the findings, Livio Amigoni, of refugee charity Eufemia Infopoint Ventimiglia, said: &quot;After the French declaration of a state of emergency and the tightening of the border in 2015, passage to France has become more difficult but has not discouraged people to try to cross. Instead, it has driven individuals to try dangerous mountain passes and lethal motorways routes, and the situation also puts many people at the mercy of smugglers and traffickers. Moreover, France holds responsibility for the minors who arrive on French soil. Despite this, French police have been sending minors back on trains from France to Ventimiglia, denying them their right to protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian authorities have been contacted for comment but had not responded at the time of publication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUBAI, UAE, November 14, 2017 </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai has ordered the ninth airlift of much needed relief supplies aimed at helping Rohingya families fleeing violent persecution in Myanmar. The aid was dispatched today from Dubai's International Humanitarian City (IHC), the world's largest aid depot where UN, international agencies and other NGOs stock relief supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Photo:http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/604042/Rohingya_Support.jpg)<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya families, who are continuing to flee Myanmar in their thousands, have created&nbsp;the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world. To date, more than 600,000 refugees have arrived in Bangladesh with thousands more still stranded in Myanmar.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the crisis began, UN agencies and NGOs&nbsp;have ramped up their relief efforts, including food assistance and&nbsp;a massive immunisation campaign that has innoculated more than 700,000 people against cholera. However, more relief&nbsp;supplies are still needed. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid has extended an 'air bridge', which began on September 12th&nbsp;to ensure food and other relief items&nbsp;got through to the suffering refugees.&nbsp;To date, more than 350,000 Rohingya refugees have received aid supplies originating from Dubai's International Humanitarian City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 814 metric tons of UN, NGO&nbsp;and other international agencies' aid has been delivered to Bangladesh from IHC&nbsp;at a cost of over&nbsp;US$2.025 million. Further aid will be delivered in the coming weeks. HH Sheikh Mohammed has also sanctioned the use of his private Boeing&nbsp;747 for the aid effort with additional C130s and Boeing&nbsp;757s as needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Messenger of Peace and Chairperson of IHC HRH Princess Haya bint Al Hussein, wife of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, said: &quot;These refugees are facing an incredibly distressing time. The numbers keep rising&nbsp;and very quickly. As a result, many Rohingya&nbsp;families have little access to medicine, food, clean water, shelter, and clothing. I am thankful to His Highness Sheikh Mohammed for his swift and continuing support for all the member&nbsp;agencies of the IHC who have committed as much aid as they could supply at short notice. We will continue to send as much help as we possibly can for these people and pray that the persecution they face will end soon and they can return to their normal lives.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UAE government pledged US$7 million for the Rohingya refugees at the Pledging Conference for Refugee Crisis organised by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and co-hosted in Geneva on October 23 by the European Union and Kuwait. As part of the pledge, the UAE government will continue to operate relief airlifts and provide aid workers, in addition to the efforts of IHC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the airlifts began in September, agencies including UNHCR, WFP, WHO, IOM, IFRC and MSF have provided relief items and humanitarian materials including shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene kits, medical supplies and logistics equipment which have been transported to the region in a massive show of international cooperation to assist the Rohingya refugees. This has been made possible by the generosity of HH Sheikh Mohammed. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UAE spends more on foreign aid than any other nation on earth compared to its wealth, according to a report published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The report noted that the UAE spent Dh15.23 billion worth of development assistance in 2016 alone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Papua New Guinea's authorities are increasing pressure on asylum seekers on Manus Islandto abandon a former detention centre,while its occupantssaypolice havedestroyed their beds, shelters and other possessions, and beat some of them up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Chief Superintendent Dominic Kakas confirmed 50 police and immigration officials visited the Manuscamp on Thursday morning and persuaded 35 of the 378 men there to leave for alternative accommodation in the nearby town of Lorengau.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no raid. It's an ongoing negotiation with the refugees,&quot; MrKakas told The Associated Press. &quot;It's not an eviction exercise. We're telling them to move because there's water, food and proper shelter on the other side.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of asylum seekers have been living on Manus Island for years, after being put there as part of Australia's &quot;stop the boats&quot; policy, which involves bringing those who reach Australia to offshore detention facilities for &quot;processing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ruled thatAustralia's policy of housing asylum seekers in the Manus camp was unconstitutional. This resulted in its closure on 31October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, residents have refused to leave, saying they fear for their safety in Papua New Guinea because of threats and attacks by local residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past three weeks authorities have made conditions tougher in the camp by removing shelters and emptying drinking water tanks. Deadlines to abandon the camp have passed without authorities taking action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Twitter, journalist and Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani said he was handcuffed and held for two hours after tweeting about the latest police operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had previously posted saying &quot;something terrible is happening right now&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are taking the phones and are very aggressive and are taking out some refugees who still remain in the rooms,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are very aggressive and put our belongings in the rubbish bins. The refugees still are silent are watching them so scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani said two refugees were in urgent need of medical attention, including one who has epilepsy. He also said an Australian Federal Police officer was directing the operation and that some of the asylum seekers had been beaten up and forcibly removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Australian Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton confirmed the police operation in the camp during a radio interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's outrageous that people are still there and they've trashed the facility. They're living in squalor,&quot; MrDutton told Sydney Radio 2GB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is an operation involving police at the centre this morning. It's like the tenant that won't move out of the house when you've built a new house for them to move into,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, UNHCR issued a statement calling what is happening on Manus &quot;a man-made and entirely preventable humanitarian crisis. It is a damning indictment of a policy meant to avoid Australia's international obligations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR also reiterated itsposition that Australia remains responsible for the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia pays Papua New Guinea, its nearest neighbour, and the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru to hold thousands of asylum seekers from Africa, the Middle East and Asia who have attempted to reach Australian shores by boat since mid-2013.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia'sPrime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull,has dismissed asylum seekers' fears for their safety if they stay in Papua New Guinea, accusing them of trying to pressure Australia into resettling them by refusing to move from Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They think that ... in some way they can pressure the Australian government to let them come to Australia. Well, we will not be pressured. We will not outsource our migration policy to people smugglers,&quot; MrTurnbull told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People on Manus should go to the alternative places of safety with all the facilities they need, they should do so peacefully and they should do so in accordance with the legal directions of Papua New Guinea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners have lost a court battle to force the Government to take the number of child refugees it was expected would be brought to the UK under the Dubs Amendment. The amendment, passed in May 2016, required the Government to act &quot;as soon as possible&quot; to relocate and support unaccompanied refugee children in Europe. It was required to consult with local authorities to determine the number of children each council has the capacity to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees, the charity leading the case, accused the Home Office of adopting a &quot;seriously defective&quot; process to measure the capacity of local councils to take in child refugees, after it emerged many local authorities were not properly consulted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government announced in early February that it was to close the Dubs scheme after accepting just 350 minors. It later admitted that an &quot;administrative error&quot; led to 130 places for child refugees offered by local councils not being taken into consideration. Freedom of Information requests submitted by Vice later showed that under the National Transfer Scheme, councils had voluntarily offered to accept 1,572 more children than they were currently supporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, Help Refugees asked the court to order the Secretary of State to consult local authorities again, urging that the Government reopen the Dubs Scheme. Although the closure of the scheme has been described as &quot;shocking&quot; and &quot;shameful&quot; by MPs and campaigners, the High Court judgement confirmed the Dubs Amendment will remain closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruling on the case yesterday morning, the Divisional Court said there was nothing that could show that the consultation process or the consideration of the results was unlawful. &quot;We are not prepared to hold that arrangements have not been made as soon as possible for this is not something within the control of the UK Government,&quot; the judge said. The Court accepted the Home Office's argument that &quot;the process of deciding who should be transferred was not one to which normal considerations of procedural fairness could realistically apply&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Alf Dubs, who himself was a child refugee, told The Independent he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; by the verdict, warning that the closure of Dubs will only lead to more children in precarious situations, with many falling prey to child traffickers. &quot;We went into this with high hopes. Based on the evidence I'm really quite surprised. I've spoken to lots of local authorities who are willing to take in more child refugees,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm hoping the appeal will work. I've been in Calais and Greece recently and this only means more children will be living in the woods with their lives are on hold. More will turn to illegal routes and the traffickers will have field day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These youngsters don't escape that there's a pull factor, as argued by Theresa May. I don't think the people living in the horrors of Syria, and caught up in conflicts in countries like Ethiopia and Eritrea come here because of Dubs. I've met some of the children who have come across through Dubs and they're doing really well, one wants to do some work with me in Parliament, another one got top marks in school. I was given the warm welcome in Britain years ago and we should still be offering this to child refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the verdict, Josie Naughton, founder and chief executive of Help Refugees said they were &quot;bitterly disappointed&quot; by this result, and said the charity intends to appeal the court's decision. &quot;At the time our litigation was issued, not a single child had been transferred to the UK under the Dubs Amendment,&quot; she said. &quot;Transfers began under the pressure of this litigation and under the pressure from campaigners and parliamentarians. We've unearthed 130 extra places, which the Government eventually admitted it had overlooked. These places for children are needed now more than ever. There are young unaccompanied children sleeping rough in Europe completely unprepared for the coming winter. We intend to appeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;This judgement has confirmed that the consultation conducted last year on the Dubs Amendment and its implementation was lawful. We remain committed to transferring 480 children from Europe to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act. We have accepted further referrals this year and transfers are ongoing. We will continue to work closely with EU partners and local authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely. In addition, our wider focus remains helping those in need of international protection in the region, which is why we have committed to resettle up to 23,000 refugees from the region - almost 9,000 are already rebuilding their lives in the UK - and pledged &pound;2.46bn to the humanitarian response to the Syria conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He faces a potentially indefinite detention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dalir (not his real name) has been told by PNG immigration authorities he has not been formally recognised as a refugee and that a deportation order has been issued for his removal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a letter from PNG immigration to Dalir says a &quot;deportation risk assessment&quot; has found there is a &quot;real risk you will be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life ... the imposition of the death penalty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority - more than 70% - of the men on Manus have been recognised as refugees. But Dalir's case is potentially one of dozens where asylum seekers might fall outside the protection of the UN refugee convention but cannot be returned to their home countries because they face persecution or possibly death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forcibly moved from Australia to Manus in 2013, Dalir initially refused to engage with PNG's refugee status determination, arguing he never sought asylum in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has since sought to submit to PNG immigration's assessment process but he has been told he has been formally and finally denied refugee status, and under PNG law his claim for protection cannot be reassessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others from Iran who have claimed similar grounds for protection to Dalir's have been recognised as refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently held in Lorengau, where the Guardian met with him, Dalir has been told by PNG's immigration department the minister for foreign affairs and immigration &quot;has ordered that you be detained and removed from Papua New Guinea&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the deportation risk assessment has found a &quot;real risk&quot; of torture or arbitrary execution in Iran, &quot;and therefore the government of Papua New Guinea will not remove you&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dalir finds himself in a legal purgatory. He faces indefinite detention for as long as he remains in PNG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you are not a refugee, you do not have a right to remain in Papua New Guinea and your removal and detention orders remain in effect,&quot; he has been told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His only option out is to elect to voluntarily return to Iran, the country where, by PNG's own assessment, he faces a real risk of being tortured or killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG immigration has been contacted for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dalir's health has deteriorated precipitously while on Manus Island. Since February this year, he has collapsed three times, most recently on 5 November, when it took more than four hours for him to be taken from the now-closed Manus Island detention centre to Lorengau for medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he arrived at Lorengau hospital, there was no working ECG machine and no capacity to do a blood test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never seen nor heard of a hospital without capacity for blood tests nor access to ECG machine,&quot; Dr Paddy McLisky from Doctors for Refugees, who has been in regular contact with Dalir, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several doctors working in the immigration detention system, including a visiting cardiologist, have recommended various tests to elicit the cause of Dalir's recurrent symptoms of varying severity of chest pain, collapse and palpitations or tachycardia,&quot; McLisky said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McLisky said he was worried for Dalir's long-term health after he suffered a heart attack in February, and injured his heart muscle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my opinion the most important test for Dalir is electrophysiological study which will determine if he has a short circuit in his heart, and if it can be fixed by ablation treatment, both of which are not available in PNG.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon Bruck, a lawyer from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, and who represents Dalir, said he was being denied necessary, possibly life-saving, medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A cardiologist advised more than six months ago that my client needs tests overseas, as the tests he needs are not available in PNG. Because he is not getting medical tests he needs, my client is afraid the next heart attack could kill him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australian Border Force is denying appropriate medical care to a number of our clients. In our legal opinion, denial of medical treatment amounts to negligence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dalir's case manager, Natasha Blucher from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said his mental health had suffered significantly over four years of detention and the ongoing uncertainty over his future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A life-threatening illness is terrifying for anyone, even in a position where they receive proper medical care. For Dalir, knowing that he has a heart condition that is not diagnosed, and that he could have a heart attack at any time, is truly terrifying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blucher said Dalir's current legal status was an &quot;absurd limbo&quot; that placed his life at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While legally recognising that Dalir cannot return to his country of origin, authorities have denied him any clear pathway to protection. He has a document stating that he cannot be deported because he faces torture or death in his home country, but which also states that he has a deportation order current. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In effect, it appears that the only option for him is to remain detained indefinitely in Papua New Guinea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The piercing pain in Joinul Islam's right arm keeps him from sleeping. He can't bend it to eat properly (to eat with one's left is considered unclean), and there are precious few painkillers to allow him to rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four months ago, he was attacked by a gang in Lorengau, his elbow was sliced open with a machete and the surgery to repair it did not work. He was promised follow-up surgery, but it never happened. Now, he waits for more medical treatment that might never come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, he bears the pain - his right arm fused at an awkward angle - without assistance. He has been told by Papaua New Guinea authorities he can get more painkillers, but only in Lorengau, the place where he was attacked. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot go back there, I cannot go back. How can I go to Lorengau? I need a safe place,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seated in a quiet corner of the darkened Manus Island detention centre, he speaks barely above a whisper. The pain, at one point, kept him awake for two weeks, he says. &quot;I am so tired,&quot; he tells the Guardian, as tears well in his eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islam has been formally recognised as a refugee, having fled persecution in his homeland Bangladesh. &quot;My country, political is problem, is not safe. For safe place, I come to Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islam says he feels under intense pressure to quit the Manus Island detention centre, even to abandon his claim for protection altogether, and risk returning to Bangladesh. &quot;All the time is pressure. My life is very difficult. I have been running five years. Too long,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islam's case is barely remarkable inside the condemned the Manus Island detention centre - officially shuttered on 31 October, with all essential services withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hygiene conditions are worsening day by day. We are thirsty and have been waiting for rain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Behrouz Boochani    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are few uninjured or healthy people among the 400 who remain in the camp, surviving on rainwater and makeshift wells, smuggled food, and solar panels powering phones that give them a link to the outside world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the camp, the Guardian saw men who, while walking through the wreckage of the site, had stepped on nails that had pierced their feet. Their infected wounds wept pus as they walked. Others revealed open and infected sores on their legs - cognisant that Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei died after a small infection that, even with medical intervention, spiralled rapidly out of control in the detention centre and ultimately killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly three weeks after the camp was formally closed, the medical situation in the condemned Manus Island detention centre has reached a new, even more dangerous stage. Even men who appear healthy are battling diarrhoea and vomiting brought on by drinking salty, contaminated water pulled from makeshift wells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday Australian Medical Association members voted unanimously to call on the Australian government to grant access for doctors to be allowed into the detention centre to intervene in what the association describes as &quot;a worsening and dangerous situation emerging on Manus&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our responsibility as a nation with a strong human rights record to ensure that we look after the health and wellbeing of these men, and provide them with safe and hygienic living conditions,&quot; the AMA president, Michael Gannon, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Decay, despair, defiance: inside the Manus Island refugee camp | Ben Doherty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Periodically, Papua New Guinean police and immigration officials - on Australian orders, the Guardian was told - enter and poison the wells, befouling them with dirt and rubbish and making the water undrinkable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men have some purification tablets and boil what they can, but their situation is unsustainable. &quot;We have a new hard problem these days,&quot; Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani  says. &quot;The toilets are full and there's a bad smell spreading in the prison camp. Hygiene conditions are worsening day by day. Hope we have some rain today to wash away the bad smell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation in Manus is critical. We are thirsty and have been waiting for rain in the past few days. We have some water we're rationing but it's not enough in tropical heat. Immigration destroyed the water we'd collected from tropical rain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Yapu, the police commander on Manus, has said fear of a widespread outbreak of potentially fatal illness was very real. &quot;The centre is unhygienic, it is subject to illness such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cholera, most often spread by unsafe water, is easily treatable with the correct medication, but without it, the infection can kill in hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a meagre and dwindling cache of medical supplies inside the camp - and a fraught supply chain bringing more in - but refugees fear what will happen when these run out. Several refugees have become the unofficial medical officers of the camp, dispensing what medications they have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even when IHMS [International Health and Medical Services] were here,&quot; one refugee says, &quot;this all we got. Panadol and water. Whatever was wrong with you: panadol and water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the men, after four years in indefinite detention, have been on antidepressant medication or reliant on an ever-increasing regimen of sleeping pills. These are almost extinguished now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said in a television interview last week the refugees still inside the Manus Island detention centre should leave it immediately, spruiking the alternative healthcare available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are squatting illegally on this maritime base and we want them to move peacefully. There are buses available; people can move to a new $10m facility where they have accommodation, they've got kitchens, they have running water, all of the services that you could imagine, including health services, security, etc; but people are trying to make a political statement by staying at the regional processing centre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is greater access to healthcare for the refugees and asylum seekers who have moved to the alternative accommodation elsewhere in Lorengau province, this remains limited. The proposed accommodation centres are still being built, with limited running water and unreliable electricity. Refugees confirmed on Monday there is still no running water in the new West Lorengau centre. Seriously ill refugees are moved to Lorengau hospital, but that is in a state of disrepair and decay. The hospital is already far beyond its capacity, it has few working diagnostic machines, and regularly runs out of medicine itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a refugee was transported to Lorengau hospital from the detention centre two weeks ago suffering from what was believed to be a heart attack, the hospital's only ECG machine was broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurses were able only to take the man's blood pressure before discharging him and sending him to alternative accommodation in Lorengau. The Guardian met the man in Lorengau; he has not had any follow-up treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those refugees and asylum seekers who are sicker still are sent to Pacific International hospital in Port Moresby for treatment, but even here, there is often little treatment offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  US once locked up white Australian immigrants in 'horror' camps akin to Manus and Nauru</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are more than 120 refugees and asylum seekers housed - at Australian expense - in hotels around Port Moresby. One hotel has been booked in its entirety for several months with refugees and asylum seekers from Manus. Australian Border Force officials are housed nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the capital, the Guardian met more than a dozen refugees and asylum seekers awaiting treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have been in Moresby two months and have had a single appointment, with no follow-up scheduled. There are also several women who have been sent from Nauru with serious illnesses and injuries, but they have not yet been treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody here is sick, they say we are sent here for treatment but nothing happens, we just get worse,&quot; one refugee from Myanmar tells the Guardian. &quot;We just wait, for what, we don't know. Who knows what our future will be.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By BBC Monitoring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A five-day protest by a group of Syrian refugees who said they wanted to leave Chile has captured the attention of the media and sparked debate online. Reports say five out of the 14 families who arrived in Chile on 12 October as part of a government-backed resettlement programme felt unsafe after an incident in Santiago on 18 November in which a Syrian woman was attacked by an unidentified man. However, a 28 November article in newspaper El Mercurio reported that &quot;the government and refugees will begin dialogue&quot; after the protests came to an end on 25 November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the Syrians' arrival in October, much of the media coverage had praised preparations by the authorities, though some had expressed concern that the refugees may struggle to integrate in Chile. Although government spokeswoman Paula Narvaez assured the media that the incident on 18 November was an &quot;isolated event&quot;, the subsequent protests caused a stir on social media, with Chileans divided over whether the refugees' actions were justified.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian community: &quot;painful situation&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article published on Radio Cooperativa's website on 24 November described the refugees' situation: &quot;They arrived 44 days ago to escape the war in their country, but are unhappy due to a feeling of discrimination. This worsened after the aggression suffered by Mariam, one of the refugees, who while four months pregnant was attacked in Macul last Saturday by an unidentified man, who tried to remove her hijab and then pushed her to the floor.&quot; The article added that the woman later suffered a miscarriage, though whether the two events are linked is unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperativa's report quoted Hernan Maluk, who as president of the Syrian Charitable Society is often referred to by the media as a representative of the Syrian diaspora in Chile. Maluk called it a &quot;painful situation&quot;, adding that while not all the refugees wanted to leave, those that did were &quot;frightened of new attacks&quot;, and highlighted the sense of &quot;fragility&quot; that they felt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chile &quot;safe&quot; for foreigners</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking with news website Emol on 24 November, Alfredo del Rio, co-ordinator for the Syrian resettlement programme, called the protests &quot;inexplicable&quot;, adding that &quot;Chile is a safe country&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;no one is forced to be in the country&quot;, but confirmed that the state was not responsible for &quot;paying for any ticket&quot; out of Chile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 26 November, Jose Sabat, mayor of Villa Alemana, where seven of the families have been resettled, told Radio Bio Bio he believed the incident involving the pregnant woman was an &quot;isolated event&quot;. He went on to say that it should not &quot;tarnish the marvellous work we are carrying out together with the Chilean government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social media split</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On social media there was a sharp divide between those who felt sympathetic to the refugees' situation and those who thought they were being &quot;ungrateful&quot;. One Facebook user remarked that &quot;a big effort has been made to give them housing, healthcare and a safe country. If they don't want to be here ... they should leave&quot;. Another said that &quot;it would be better to give the same opportunities to other foreigners&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 24 November report by the 24 Horas TV news programme garnered attention online after one of the protesters told an interviewer, &quot;we want to go to Canada, Switzerland or Belgium&quot;, leading several Facebook users to accuse the refugees of using Chile as a &quot;springboard&quot;. Some users said the Syrians were likely suffering from &quot;culture shock&quot;, but another warned that &quot;there is also discrimination against Muslims in Europe&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who sympathised with the Syrians were quick to remind their fellow users of what the refugees had been through, however. One Facebook comment said people &quot;are forgetting that [the Syrians] are in Chile because they are not safe in their own country! It's embarrassing to read how Chilean people talk about foreigners&quot;. Another said, &quot;it is obvious that if someone attacks one of them they will feel unsafe, I would feel the same if I went to country where they told me I would be safe&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman who claims her husband was shot dead by pro-government supporters in Nigeria some years ago has won her appeal over being refused refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-judge Court of Appeal unanimously ruled the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) breached the woman's right to fair procedures in how it reached adverse findings about her personal credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She came here some months after her husband's death more than 10 years ago, but did not apply for asylum for another four years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being arrested by garda&iacute; over failure to produce identification documents, she sought asylum on grounds of a &quot;well-founded&quot; fear of persecution, as the widow of a leader of an anti-government militia, if returned to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner refused refugee status and, because of her four-year delay seeking refugee status, she was entitled to a &quot;papers-only&quot; appeal before the RAT, not an oral hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She argued the tribunal was obliged to take particular care as she had no opportunity to respond to concerns in the mind of the tribunal member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the High Court dismissed her judicial review proceedings over the RAT's adverse credibility findings, she appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allowing the appeal, Mr Justice Michael Peart said a number of reasons for the adverse credibility finding were &quot;flawed&quot; because they were based on matters of concern to the tribunal, which the woman was given no opportunity to address and which were &quot;material&quot; to her case and her credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These included the tribunal's failure to consider a newspaper article which, if authentic, provided &quot;powerful evidence&quot; of the correctness of her claim her husband was a leader of an anti-government group who was murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge was also concerned the tribunal raised issues about the woman not having produced a marriage certificate when she had not been asked to do so and it had never been suggested she was not married to the murdered man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also concerned questions about the authenticity of a death certificate for the husband were never put to her before the tribunal, in its decision, expressed concerns about that certificate, including it being dated the same date as the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That issue should have been put to the woman before the tribunal decided her account was not credible, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was &quot;curious&quot; that, until the hearing of this appeal, neither the woman, the ORAC, the RAT, nor any of the lawyers involved in the case appeared to have noticed the death certificate, shown to the court, described the primary cause of death as &quot;haemorrhage/gun shot&quot;, he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the RAT indicated a concern the certificate did not indicate the cause of the haemorrhage and therefore did not corrorobrate the woman's claim he had been shot, solicitors for the woman replied it was asserted the haemorrhage and heart failure stemmed from the shooting and the certificate did not indicate the reasons why those conditions occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reference to &quot;gun shot&quot; on the certificate was &quot;clearly relevant&quot; to the credibility of the woman's case as it was corroborative of her claim her husband was shot, giving rise to her own well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Nigeria, the judge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because this matter was not referred to in the RAT decision or by the High Court, and was only referred to in submissions in the appeal, the Court of Appeal could not have regard to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all the circumstances, the court would quash the RAT decision due to breach of fair procedures, he ruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comedian and writer Jo Brand is on her way to Swansea to help raise money to help the plight of refugees - after answering a cry for help from an old friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The veteran stand-up headlines a show at the city's Grand Theatre on October 13, which will provide funds for organisation Help Refugees, which supports refugees worldwide wityh food, shelter and funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening, which will also feature fellow comedian Andy Robinson, has been organised by Bafta Cymru winner Helen Griffin, who first met Jo when the pair were on a nurse training and degree course at Brunel University in 1979.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jo said: &quot;Helen is one of my oldest and bestest friends. I was one year ahead of her on the nurse training course, but I could tell immediately we had the same sense of humour and interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have done big laughing over the years to the point on occasions that we were either almost incontinent or sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have always really admired her and what a good person she is. She genuinely does the best she can for everyone and over the years has not only expressed her desire to actively support refugees, but she puts her money where her mouth is and has befriended and supported a refugee family besides doing fundraising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would do anything she asked because I always know it will be a fantastic cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helen, whose credits include Twin Town, Gavin &amp;amp; Stacey, Under Milk Wood, as well as Little White Lies, said she had been moved to stage the fundraiser, adding: &quot;Jo was a year ahead of me at university, and much more confident and streetwise - and she still is!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I arrived a hippy with long dresses and long hair and she took me to her mate, a hairdresser, who chopped it all off and my transformation to punk was begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was also the funniest person I'd ever met and seemed to find my impressions of my grandad funny so I just repeated them endlessly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope to sell out this show, and after minimal expenses such as for insurance and travel expenses for the performers, all the money will go to Help Refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will use it to provide shelter, food, clothing for people in desperate need - at Calais, Syria, Greece, Iraq, Serbia and Italy to name a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's great to think that we will be helping to provide warmth and shelter for refugees as winter approaches. No matter what your politics, these are human beings just like us, suffering the most appalling conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No-one leaves their homes with their possessions on the backs, carrying young children, unless they are desperate. It is inhumane to turn our faces away. Our heartless government does, but we don't need to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also think Jo wants to come down because she hasn't heard me do any impressions of my grandad for a while - and she loves to have a walk on the beach when she does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said they chose The Grand because she had lived and worked at the Grand many times - most recently reprising her one-woman show, 'Caitlin', for the Dylan Thomas centenary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So it seemed the best place to approach and they've been fantastic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are so grateful to Jo for coming to do this gig, she supports many charities already and her generosity will make such a difference to so many refugees' lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees will be represented at the event with a stall manned by members, providing information about their work.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A heartbreaking photo has emerged of a Rohingya Muslim mother desperately clutching her dead baby after the boat they were travelling to escape from Myanmar capsized as the family was fleeing to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The image bears a tragic resemblance to the lifeless body of Aylan Kurdi, a young Syrian refugee who washed up dead on a Turkish beach in September 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The desperately sad photo of the dead Rohingya baby boy, only 40 days old, was taken in south-eastern Bangladesh by photographer Dar Yasin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He describes walking on the beach near the town of Cox's Bazar when he noticed 'some sort of commotion'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;'A boat had capsized. Some women were unconscious. One woman was crying, as a family member had drowned; three more were in precarious condition and I was unsure if they would make it. Another woman was consoling her,' Yasin told&nbsp; Time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And then suddenly, the woman who was consoling the crying woman started wailing herself. Her husband had come over with Abdul Masood, one of their twin sons, who was dead. She held one child who was alive and one who wasn't breathing. It was heartbreaking.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yasin said the boat the refugees were travelling in - containing 45 members of the same family - capsized only a few meters from the shore. But it was too far away to save&nbsp;Hanida Begum's child.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are among hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who have fled Burma to escape persecution at the hands of the predominately Buddhist government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar leader and Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has received criticism from across the world &nbsp;for her failure strongly to speak out about their plight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The refugees - who have been described as some of the most persecuted people in the world &nbsp;- are living in pitiable conditions in squalid camps in south-eastern Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their misery has been compounded recently by strong monsoon rains which have flooded their flimsy shelters made only out of bamboo and plastic sheets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People in the camps were left in a mudbath on Wednesday as they desperately packed their meagre belongings into plastic sacks in a desperate quest to find drier shelters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their numbers have soared to more than 420,000 in a matter of weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees also have to contend with enforced relocations at the hands of the Bangladesh authorities and extortion demands if they try to remain where they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of three-year-old Syrian boy Alyan Kurdi made global headlines in September 2015 when he drowned while he and his family were trying to reach Europe along with thousands of other refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photographs of his body quickly spread around the world and became the defining image of the horror of the Middle East refugee crisis.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian refugees are being abused and humiliated by Turkish military as they try to cross the border, with the most recent incident showing men being made to wear lingerie.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Images published on social media shows three men, reportedly Syrian refugees, all wearing brightly coloured women's underwear with visible bruising and lacerations on their arms and backs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident is said to have taken place at the border, just days after several Turkish soldiers were arrested for abusing Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are all dressed in boots, trousers and yellow, pink and red lingerie sets, standing next to a tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pictures, posted on Twitter by Syrian journalist Ahmad Alkhatib show three men all dressed in boots, trousers - and yellow, pink and red lingerie sets.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Again and again #Turkish soldiers insulting some of the #Syrians who tried to went to #Turkey. Syrians still insulted,' Mr Alkhatib wrote alongside the images.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The images are said to have originally been posted online by the soldiers themselves, emerge just days after three Turkish soldiers were arrested for abusing Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trio filmed themselves beating up and verbally abusing four young Syrians who had attempted to cross the border illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video, widely shared on social media but which could not be independently verified, appears to shows four Turkish soldiers kicking and beating the Syrians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video was apparently filmed by one soldier, whose shadow appears in the footage. It was not immediately clear how the footage had been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One soldier asks the Syrians: 'Will you come to Turkey again? Be quiet man! Don't shout.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One soldier is also seen repeatedly kicking a Syrian and then again once he is on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrians are seen groaning in pain in the video. And the soldier asks another man: 'Why did you bring the refugees in? Are you a smuggler?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A court in the southern Turkish province of Hatay ruled three of the soldiers would be remanded in custody but released a fourth soldier, state-run news agency Anadolu reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the arrests, the army said in a statement late Sunday that 'the personnel in question were taken into custody and all administrative and judicial procedures have been immediately started against them'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;It said the Syrians who attempted to cross illegally were deported back after passing medical checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey is home to 2.9 million Syrian refugees, according to government figures, but the vast majority are scattered throughout the country rather than in camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ankara's allies have applauded the generosity shown by Turkey to its Syrian neighbours throughout the conflict although there have been signs of growing tensions recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, Syrian refugee in Turkey was raped and bludgeoned to death by rock-wielding attackers just days before she was due to give birth, and her 10-month-old baby strangled, sparking outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early stages of the conflict, Turkey had an 'open-door' policy for Syrians seeking to flee to the country but in reality the border has tightened considerably since then.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SouriyaNasser al Ahmad, 39, lives in one of the settlements affected just outside the town of Qom Elias, where it is thought the blaze was started by someone using a gas canister to cook in one of the camp's 94 tents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her memory of what happened on Sunday afternoon isn't clear because everything happened so quickly, but she recalls scooping up her younger children and running for the camp's only entrance as towers of black smoke rose into the air.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While cooking fires are common in the haphazardly built settlements in which many Syrians in Lebanon are forced to live, they are normally quickly contained, affecting a tent or two before residents manage to put them out. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Refugee Day passed almost unnoticed this week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to the searing 40 degree summer heat wave and wheat crop surrounding the camp, however, it spread very quickly. Several residents said that the fire extinguishers they used to try to put it out had expired and didn't work properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ninety-one of the camp's 94 homes were completely destroyed, leaving around 700 homeless. Almost everyone's identification papers and the few souvenirs and trinkets from home that survived the dangerous journey across the border were destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've never seen anything as severe as this. Usually fires are under control much quicker,&quot; said Antoine Ghazaly, the UN Refugee Agency's child protection officer for the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identification papers and the few trinkets from home that survived the dangerous journey across the border were also destroyed(WorldVision)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Souriya-named for her country, an old fashioned moniker which Syrians do not often give their babies these days -came to Lebanon with her husband Hamoud and their children in 2013. Natives of Raqqa, when Isis began to gain a foothold in the area they decided to get out while they still could.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now they have a family of six. Hamoud does odd jobs around the camp for cash in accordance with the strict rules set for Syrian work permits, but the family are desperately poor. He often suffers from migraines which leave him too unwell to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The usual image associated with refugees is one of camps filled with row upon row of white tents -but after taking in so many Palestinians after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and fearful of encouraging people to stay, the Lebanese authorities havenot set up official government-runcamps for those displaced by Syria's civil war, complicating the work of aid organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Syrian families often make their own homes out of the materials to hand -with limited UN and NGO assistance -or move into derelict or abandoned buildings, often in already overcrowded Palestinian areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to a summer heat wave and wheat fields surrounding the camp, the fire was able to spread quickly(WorldVision)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hope that kept Souriya going for the last few months was the promise of a new home her father was helping build for the family: a four by four metre semi-permanent house made from timberframe, breezeblocks and tarpaulin, which would have its own latrine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like everything else at Qob Elias camp, it went up in flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While rebuilding work has already begun in earnest -every family reconstructing their own shelter with help from the local Lebanese community -it does not mitigate the sense of loss for many. Souriya'sfamily's case is complicated by the fact they were missing the right permits and papers in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking about the house she had dreamed about, Souriya began to cry. &quot;I don't understand,&quot; she said, her children sitting around her. &quot;They're telling me I'm not able to have my own tent [or the new one her father was building]. It makes my life so complicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Ara, who saw her parents and one son die from hunger as she made the arduous journey to safety in Bangladesh, said she also witnessed soldiers attacking the elderly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An asylum seeker who had been suffering acute mental health crises for more than a year - and whose friends had pleaded with Australian authorities for him to be treated - has been found dead on Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of Hamed Shamshiripour, an Iranian national, was found in the forest near the Australian-run East Lorengau refugee transit centre. Manus province police chief, Inspector David Yapu, confirmed the death and said a crime scene had been established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian has seen photographs, purporting to show Shamshiripour as he was found in the forest. The body has visible wounds, but the circumstances of his death are unclear.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'There'll be a big tragedy': Manus deadlock could reach breaking point</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial reported cause of his death, suicide, has been contested by refugees and asylum seekers on the island. There are reports from Manus island that Shamshiripour had been missing since Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamshiripour, 31, had initially been rejected for refugee status, but that status was being reviewed. Several refugees said Shamshiripour had recently made attempts to commit suicide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamshiripour had spent some time in Australia for medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The Guardian reported in June last year that Shamshiripour was found, naked in the Mike compound, yelling in an incoherent and distressed state, and was arrested and taken to Lorengau prison, before being taken to the &quot;managed accommodation area&quot; within the detention centre for people suffering mental health problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a formal complaint made by 14 fellow refugees and asylum seekers, Shamshiripour was beaten by guards instead of being cared for. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We, the signatories to this complaint form want to know why you are not providing mental health support to Hamed ... and instead you have subjected him to ill-treatment and corporal punishment because he is not behaving normally due to his mental ailment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January this year, Shamshiripour was jailed again following an acute mental breakdown. He was released from prison, only to be found wandering the streets of Lorengau half-naked, &quot;hungry and homeless&quot; according to refugees, police and politicians on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaked psychological support files from within the Manus Island detention centre refer consistently to Shamshiripour's &quot;chaotic presentation&quot; and report he was &quot;agitated, aggressive, verbally abusive, pushing boundaries constantly, and has required police presence on numerous occasions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another report says: &quot;Hamed is currently acting erratic, raising serious mental health concerns, and not engaging in linear discussions with case managers or others. Hamed's behaviour prevents a cooperative, meaningful engagement and report based on observations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hamed informed case manager he has not made a decision about returning to Iran (while he was singing he said I want to go to Iran, wants to go to Persia). He has become a danger to stakeholders and residents alike with his erratic and unpredictable behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other reports, Shamshiripour was seen by staff drinking local home-brew alcohol and was warned of its dangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamshiripour was jailed several times after suffering severe mental episodes and behaving unpredictably or aggressively. Detention centre staff told Guardian Australia he was &quot;a very sick man. He needs serious help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January Manus MP Ron Knight, who arranged for Shamshiripour to be released from prison so he could access mental healthcare, said he was receiving none.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be blunt, the guy is dangerous to all around him and he needs psychiatric help. There is none for him here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight said he approached the Australian high commission in Port Moresby about Shamshiripour being committed to a psychiatric facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The response to me was basically that our authorities should handle it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection, which runs the detention centre and the refugee transit centre on Monday confirmed it was &quot;aware of a death in Lorengau township&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;PNG authorities are investigating the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Further questions should be directed to the government of PNG.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamshiripour's family has been informed of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five refugees and asylum seekers have died on Manus Island under Australian government control since offshore processing was restarted in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said while suicide was supected in Shamshiripour's death, refugees on Manus were convinced his death was suspicious as he had been targeted for violence in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rintoul said Shamshiripour's death confirmed the worst fears of refugees who are currently being coerced to leave the detention centre for the transit centre where Shamshiripour was held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manus is not safe. East Lorengau is not safe. They have already told border force that they will not move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International's Graham Thom said Shamshiripour's death was &quot;yet another bleak tragedy to arise out of the ongoing suffering and tensions on Manus Island&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'You are worse than I am': Trump told Turnbull he admired offshore detention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not yet clear if his death was a result of self-harm or violence. Irrespective of the cause, Australia must accept liability for the damage its cruel policies are causing refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a man who came seeking Australia's protection, Amnesty International is gravely concerned that he was provided inadequate healthcare and that his safety was not the paramount consideration.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the gap between Camilla Thurlow and Jamie Jewitt widened into a veritable gulf on Thursday night, as they differed - quite drastically - over their choice of holiday once they leave the villa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Jamie suggested the pair party it up in Ibiza, Camilla left viewers 'howling' as she insisted they visit a refugee camp, during a La La Land-themed dinner date.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussing their holiday plans, Jamie said: 'So I'm going to Ibiza are you in?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camilla countered: 'I've&nbsp;never been to Ibiza so that's good. It's a good trade off that we then do work in a refugee camp.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie nodded noncommittally at her suggestion, murmuring: 'There's so much to do, so many places to go. We're gonna warm up in London, then go to Ibiza.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers flocked to Twitter to express their amusement at the chat, suggesting the two might be a tad 'incompatible'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Where should we go after this? Camilla: I'm going 2 take u 2 a refugee camp so we can help people Jamie: Yea.. We can go Ibiza,' another added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, during the date, Camilla cast aside her previously reserved nature and opened up about her true feelings for Jamie.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Right now is the happiest I've been in a very long time. The next step will be going back to reality and doing things our way,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie replied: 'I feel so good - we have done things our way. I can't wait to get outside and see more sides of you which I know are in there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You show me a little bit more each day and that's exciting.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camilla added: 'l know when you meet my friends and my family, you'll see what I mean about being happy. That fun mischievous side of me was the biggest side of me, but I went and saw some of these things and that part of me went away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I don't feel that overwhelming feeling of guilt anymore. I feel like I'm allowed to be happy now, it's feeling you're not quite as strange as you were.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie replied: 'I know exactly what you mean. There's nothing you need to hide - unless you're a part-time dominatrix. We've learnt a hell of a lot about each other.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added about the date: 'It's converted me from a hopeless romantic into a hopeful one.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And perhaps making a reference to the 'different sides' to Camilla, the Scottish beauty dropped a very racy hint about the couple's sexual antics earlier in the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a candid chat with Gabby, Camilla whispered: 'I've been a bit naughty, if you know what I mean.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suggesting that she may have performed a steamy act, she then pointed grinning to her lips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabby whooped with laughter and stared open-mouthed at the sky in shock over the confession.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camilla - who had sex with Jamie several nights before - later admitted: 'Jamie&nbsp;and I had a little bit of fun last night. I literally cannot resist him, it's a real problem in my life right now.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of a UK aid charity has said the Rohingya people are victims of &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslim minority refugees fleeing violence in their home state of Rakhine in Burma describe soldiers and Buddhist leaders carrying out a systematic campaign of murder and burning villages, accusations which military leaders have denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alistair Dutton, director of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (Sciaf) which has raised more than &pound;160,000 to help the refugees, said: &quot;I don't know who's guilty of what but what has happened are crimes against humanity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chopping people up, shooting them, burning bodies, torching villages, stealing belongings and driving people out their country - these are crimes against humanity whoever perpetrated them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on a visit to the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, Mr Dutton said: &quot;There are an overwhelming number of reports. Everyone spoken to has seen or knew of someone who had family killed. I think if these reports were verified they would quite clearly be crimes against humanity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a recent agreement by the Bangladesh and Burmese government for repatriation, refugees continue to arrive, joining some 646,000 who have braved the dangerous border crossing since the surge in violence after Rohingya militants reportedly attacked border posts in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Dutton warned the crisis could last for years, stressing that Sciaf and charity partner Caritas Bangladesh were planning for the long term as the average length of time a person spends as a refugee is 17 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;We're here to help the Rohingya. No one should be under any illusion that the recent Memorandum of Understanding between Myanmar and Bangladesh signals the end of this massive humanitarian disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The exile of the Rohingya refugees will almost certainly last for years and we will be here for as long as it takes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early December around 30 refugees were arriving daily by boat from Burma to Shabrang Harbour at the Bangladesh border before being taken to the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Rohingya people are victims of 'crimes against humanity', Sciaf director says twitter 1                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One mother who made the crossing earlier this month said she saw children burned to death by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Razia Begum, 30, said: &quot;I saw some little children who were killed by being burned by fire. I felt very horrible because I did not know how I could protect my children and so I left for another place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she had no food, money or way to survive in Bangladesh without help and aid donations but said she added &quot;here I have shelter and I have peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another new arrival, seven-year-old Noor Karima, saw her mother and father killed in front of her and escaped to cross the border with her aunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samara Besam, 25, who travelled with her three-year-old son, spent a month in hiding near the Burma border before the day-long crossing to arrive at Shabrang and said she would not return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;The military and Buddhist leaders tortured us. Why would we go back to Myanmar when there is no peace? They killed us and burned our houses. Why would we go back when there is no shelter?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senowara Begum, 18, now living at the Kutupalong camp, said Buddhists and the military burnt their homes, killed the young men and tortured women and girls but said she would return if the Bangladesh government &quot;can ensure the peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;I want to have peace in Myanmar so we can go back. The Myanmar government has to give the Rohingya rights. They have to give us compensation - to return our cows, goats and chickens and give us back our livelihood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another resident of the camp, Muhamed Ali, told of his father sacrificing himself to save his family and being &quot;chopped into pieces&quot; by soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 28-year-old said he would prefer to die in Bangladesh than be sent back to his homeland without the creation of Rohingya state with rights and citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;The whole world should pressure Myanmar to agree these terms. If this doesn't happen we will go anywhere where we can find peace. If the Bangladesh government sends us back without any proper settlement, I would say that they should just kill us right here. We would be happier to die here than back in Myanmar.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest estimate of the number of Rohingya who have arrived in Bangladesh since violence erupted in Myanmar has crossed the half million mark, at 501,000 as of Thursday,&quot; Andrej Mahecic, spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told reporters at today's regular press briefing in Geneva.<BR><BR>&quot;Giving the newly arrived refugees the ability to construct their own shelter, begin cooking for themselves and taking care of their families is an important first step on the road to healing,&quot; he added.<BR><BR>The 2,000-acre (809 hectare) extension site on the outskirts of Kutupalong Camp in southeast Bangladesh is becoming more organized, turning into a series of communities as UNHCR and its partners supporting the Bangladesh Government deliver more emergency relief items.<BR><BR>From its $ 4.2 million budget, UNHCR is contributing $ 2 million to support Bangladesh in constructing a road for easier aid delivery into Kutupalong extension site and shipping in 23 vehicles to assist aid efforts.<BR><BR>UNHCR nutrition experts estimate that approximately 18 per cent of new arrivals suffer from acute malnutrition.<BR><BR>&quot;This is due to more than lack of food,&quot; said Mr. Mahecic. &quot;We witness dire need for psycho-social support and counselling among refugees,&quot; he said adding that many breastfeeding mothers are &quot;severely traumatised, sick and malnourished.&quot;<BR><BR>UNHCR is working with its partner Action Against Hunger to provide warm meals as private donors conduct ad hoc food distributions, which is also becoming more structured.<BR><BR>&quot;As Bangladesh shoulders the full extent of this refugee crisis, UNHCR calls on all countries in the region to show solidarity and do their part in keeping their borders open and protecting refugees who are fleeing discrimination, persecution and violence in Myanmar,&quot; concluded Mr. Mahecic.<BR><BR>UN Migration agency reports at least 23 dead in Bay of Bengal boat tragedy More tragic details have emerged about yesterdays' reports that Rohingya refugees died when the boat they were using to reach safety in Bangladesh capsized in the Bay of Bengal's rough seas.<BR><BR>An International Organization for Migration (IOM) local field team travelled to the scene to assist survivors and assess any further response needed. Today, they report that, having checked with police and the owner of a grocery shop located close to where the incident occurred, the total confirmed dead is now 23.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any return of the Rohingya refugees who took shelter in Bangladesh must be voluntary, safe and dignified, the UNHCR assistant high commissioner for protection said yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volker Turk, the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees] official, also appreciated the role of Bangladesh in tackling the Rohingya issue and assured the country of full support from his agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Bangladesh and its authority have our full appreciation and admiration. You have literally saved over 6,00,000 lives by opening the border and allowing the Rohingyas to enter,&quot; he told a press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) organised the conference at a hotel in the capital after Turk concluded his five-day visit to the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your initiative was extremely noble and honourable, and you deserve full support from the international communities and the UN,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Replying to a question, the commissioner said, &quot;It is clear that we need to fight for the return of the refugees who fled from Rakhine State. It is obvious that the people who fled are in a very vulnerable and extremely dire situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About Myanmar government's delay in solving the crisis, he recommended having patience and be persistent to ensure Rohingyas' right to return to their country. He said, &quot;We also need to ensure the return is sustainable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner said, &quot;We also have to listen carefully to the needs of the host community in Cox's Bazar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to work with the government of Myanmar and its people to help them implement the Rakhine commission report. Of course, it won't be easy, but we need to start the process,&quot; he also said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a UNHCR press release issued last night, Turk said, &quot;For return to happen, it's clear there has to be safety and guarantees of protection. There has to be a very serious commitment to immediately implementing the recommendations of the commission's report&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR family countdown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One-third of the Rohingya families, who took shelter at Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, are in a vulnerable situation because of serious health problems and harsh condition of the camp, UNHCR found after conducting a recent family countdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of them, about 14 percent are single mothers holding their families together with little support in harsh camp conditions, while others are struggling with serious health problems or disabilities, it found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN refugee agency revealed the findings yesterday after finishing the first phase of the Rohingya refugee family counting, where 120,284 families comprising 517,643 refugees from Myanmar have so far been counted, said a statement of UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to UNHCR, around 6,07,000 Rohingyas estimated to have fled to Bangladesh following the torture by the Myanmar authorities on the Muslim minority in Myanmar's Rakhine since 25 August.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the shadow of what was once the notorious Calais Jungle thousands of refugees have become living targets for smugglers and human traffickers as their plight becomes increasingly perilous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year on from the demolition of the shantytown, dozens of displaced families are sleeping rough in woodland in the region waiting for their chance to be smuggled into Britain by criminals - often after paying extortionate amounts to guarantee their passage across the Channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of lone teenagers who don't have the means to pay are meanwhile increasingly prone to exploitation at the hands of these gangs, who are promising them a free crossing in return for &quot;work&quot; upon arrival in the UK.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calais: 'Dogs are allowed in cars here, but refugees not'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees' desperation is exacerbated by the looming winter coupled with the dearth of any form of state or official aid. Since the UK Home Office ended funding for an anti-trafficking service in the region in April 2017, there has been no state agency tackling the problem, leaving the market &quot;open&quot; to criminals who wish to exploit refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official figures indicate the number of gangs targeting the refugees in the area since the Jungle was demolished has increased, with 20 smuggling networks having been dismantled by French police since the start of the year - matching the figure for the whole of 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were just over 8,000 refugees living in the Jungle before it was destroyed, and more than 10,000 at its peak. Following its closure people were transported away from the region to reception centres across France, but in the last 12 months the numbers have been slowly rising again. Between 1,500 and 2,000 refugees are currently sleeping rough in Calais and Dunkirk, according to charities on the ground.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he carries his phone at all times in case the smuggler calls, having identified a sleeping driver in a lorry, at which point Ari will take his family immediately to the location and make the dangerous attempt to board the vehicle without being heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He says, 'come, come now', and I get my family up and we all get in,&quot; Ari explained. &quot;We've tried many times but no luck. After one or two hours the driver wakes up. I'm hoping it will work eventually, because we have no other choice. Of course this is dangerous for my children, but I don't have any solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several miles east in Calais, hundreds of teenagers and young people meander in a small field close to the now inaccessible land where the Jungle used to be. Late at night, they go to nearby parking lots to try to board lorries. But with smuggling gangs &quot;controlling&quot; many of these areas, they are exposed to increasing danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of young refugees still sleep rough in Calais in the hope of one day reaching the UK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rishal, 28 and one of the eldest of around 20 women and girls in the area, saidher family has paid &pound;10,000 to smugglers so far for her crossing from Eritrea to join her younger brother in Cardiff. She explainedthat now the money has run out, and she is trying to cross to the UK unassisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I try often in the night, sometimes early in the morning. We try to get into lorries. Spending six hours in a truck is hard, and then you get out and you aren't in England,&quot; she said,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rubbingthe back of her neck. She explainedthat it is painful from the last attempt she made four days ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eritrean woman doesn'texplicitly state the risk of traffickers, but she expressesher fear of Kurdish and Afghan men who often guard the lorry parking areas. &quot;They are dangerous,&quot; she said. &quot;They have knives. I don't like go near them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael McHugh, of the Refugee Youth Service, a Calais-based charity that keeps records of children in the region, saidrefugees, particularly the younger ones, are being exploited by people smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're becoming increasingly aware of is that young people are being exploited while on the move. They are being moved for the purpose of exploitation. The opportunities to cross the border have become more limited, and there's been an increase in prices - so smugglers by default are becoming traffickers. The market has opened up for it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They'll say: 'I'll get you across and you don't have to pay now but I do have a friend that you could work for in the UK'. Children are becoming more desperate and susceptible. We've had many young people who we've believed are in the UK but who we now can't find.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Refugee Youth Service refers any young person they suspect to have crossed to the Britain to a UK-based anti-trafficking agency. The charity has sent 22 referrals for minors since the beginning of August this year, of whom just seven have been located safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shrubland where hundreds of young refugees reside day to day in Calais as they attempt to board lorries to the UK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McHugh said a lack of a joined-up approach between British and French authorities to track the youngsters, particularly since the Home Office cut funding for an anti-trafficking service in the region, means he and other volunteers feel increasingly helpless in their efforts to protect them from trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have young people who we are trying to engage with, and we can feel the presence of adult interference. This is what gets the alarm bells ringing, but we are powerless to do much about it,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hannah Stott, programme manager of the Barnardo'schild trafficking advocacy, said her agency is working with dozens of young people in the UK who were brought from northern France to the UK by traffickers, who then use &quot;sophisticated grooming techniques&quot; to lure them into forced labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They use coercion through threats of violence or whatever it might be to then lead onto that exploitation in France, on route and then when they arrive in the UK. They offer to get them to the UK for free, but then on arrival they have to pay back X amount of money - we're talking thousands or sometimes tens of thousands of dollars,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in Calais suffering trench foot from squalid conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many are experiencing labour exploitation, such as working in car washes, the construction industry and agriculture, with others victims to criminal exploitation, including being forced into petty crime and running drugs for highly organised criminal gangs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Stott said that along with high numbers of Vietnamese and Albanian child trafficking victims, whose plight is fairly well-documented, there has been a notable rise in the past year of young people from Sudan and Afghanistan - two of the most common nationalities sleeping rough in northern France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked what the UK was doing to prevent child trafficking from northern France to the UK, a Home Office spokesman said: &quot;We provided funding to [French organisation] France Terre d'Asile to help identify and protect victims of trafficking in the Calais camp, which was cleared in autumn 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UK and France worked extremely closely to coordinate the clearance and ensure those in need of protection were moved to suitable facilities. We transferred over 900 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children to the UK from other European countries last year, including more than 750 from France as part of the UK's support for the Calais camp clearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We continue to work closely with our French counterparts to target people traffickers and enhance security at the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local authority in Calais said border police in the region, supported by the Ocriest, the French agency responsible for tackling illegal immigration, were &quot;fighting every day against the smuggling channels across coast&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the beginning of 2017, the police have already dismantled 20 clandestine immigration networks, as much as throughout 2016. In addition, 15 investigations are currently under way, nine of which are related to the Calais region,&quot; a spokesperson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judicial authority imposes heavy penalties on smugglers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Animated conversations in a range of accents fill the air in the plain central London office. Smells of cumin and coconut mingle while Prosecco corks pop. Between the desks, among gym bags and notepads and computers, bright African headwraps nod in unison with demure Syrian hijabs, while young children draw contentedly sitting on the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the office's small kitchen, guests heap paper plates with flaky samosas, light falafel, chicken curry infused with coriander, and kidney beans steeped in coconut milk and tomatoes - all muddling together with dots of yoghurt and hot sauce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees Welcome to Dinner is a project set up by Unicef and Purpose, a charitable organisation that mobilises people to create more fairness and equality. It started as a two-week series of supper clubs based in New York, to help refugees meet business leaders. It has spread across the world from America to Canada, Norway and Germany.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight's event is the seventh so far in London. The food is from Spice Caravan, a caterer set up by seven refugee women from five different countries. And the pudding, a coconut sugar syrup semolina called Muhallabia, is from Aleppo Supper Club. Gissou Nia is a strategy director at Purpose. She worked for the campaign group that sent a refugee team to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The dining programme evolved from that and she launched it on Valentine's Day this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was about reappropriating the holiday so it's not just about romantic love but neighbourly love, and it's now July so it went on a lot longer,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm Iranian and in our community we do this with new arrivals from Iran, and I saw Syrian expats do the same thing. But when I talked to my friends [in the US], they had never been to these dinners and their first reaction was: 'How do we get involved?' &quot; In the US, dinners have been held by tech companies such as Facebook; talent agencies and Airbnb have done the same in the UK. The point of the gatherings, says Purpose, is &quot;to break bread and break barriers&quot; - to ensure that refugees are made to feel welcome rather than being treated with suspicion. Camilla Lewis and Rob Carey are chief executives of Curve Media, a TV production company and host of tonight's event. &quot;We wanted to make the point that, like London, we are open,&quot; says Lewis as we stand by an office pillar. &quot;My grandparents are refugees?? we shouldn't feel threatened, because these are people who can enrich our society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carey nods. &quot;There are people here who are writers, producers, and they are of interest to our company as well. To think we don't want this pool of brilliant talent to join us is crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the best stories to come out of the clubs so far is of the Venezuelan refugee who met a marketing executive at a dinner in New York. They have gone into business together making Venezuelan vegan food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Change can be local,&quot; says Nia. &quot;Our view is that if you are a company, you have power - and we can connect folk to that power. I didn't want it to be a group of people listening to one refugee or asylum seeker telling their story - where they are almost on display. This is meant to be a social gathering and it was really important that the numbers be evenly split.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am introduced to Teem Koheratee, who wears thick-framed hipster glasses and a baseball cap and speaks with a London accent. He is an asylum seeker who has lived in London for 14 years, arriving on a student visa when he was 20, then working as an operations manager in the retail industry. He overstayed his visa and then claimed asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is gay and from Mauritius, where his sexuality is an issue. &quot;My parents don't accept it, they can't accept it at all - they still do religious ceremonies to save me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been waiting for a year for his application to be reviewed and has spent the past month in a hostel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lifestyle I lead in the hostel is very different from what normal people would have,&quot; he says. &quot;So getting away from that environment and having food that actually tastes like food, it makes a massive change for us -it's a luxury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koheratee suffers from depression and he tried to commit suicide when he was 11 and again when he was 13. His suicidal thoughts have just begun to return, but he says events such as the dinner are helping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's crazy that, after 22 years, I started having [those] thoughts again... and it's all due to the depression and the situation I'm in. I told the Home Office about it but it's like shouting into a black hole. They tell you to write a letter and you write, but you never hear anything back. But seeing people here and sharing our experiences is great because a lot of people don't really know what goes on in the background. So this is kind of like therapy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheghaf Abosaleh moved to London from Syria in January, shortly after her husband made the journey. &quot;We tried not to leave Syria,&quot; she says. &quot;We stayed for about five years during the war. Even now we want to go back as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a difficult decision, especially when you leave parents and family. You feel guilty that you went and they are still there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is an architect and has just been accepted on to a masters programme in urban design. Her threeyear-old daughter sits nearby, quietly colouring. They came to the first Refugees Welcome dinner and have been to every one since. They have made friends with other Syrian refugees through the supper clubs and they now visit each other regularly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My goal was to come here to study... and be prepared to rebuild Syria. My husband got a job here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Syria, it's just time is stopping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's better you go out and do something useful because then you can help others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also meet Ahmad (who doesn't want to give his full name), who runs the Aleppo Supper Club and helps with translating the invitations that go out to the refugee dinner guests. He tells me about his life in Aleppo as soon as I say hello.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was tortured by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They cut my thumb, they bit me on my head, they use a lot of electricity. My family paid a lot of money to release me.&quot; He shows me his thumb, which is severed halfway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got private treatment for eight months because it was too dangerous to go to the hospital - because if they find me, they could also kill me. They killed some of my relatives. My cousin was cycling with his child and now his child has mental health problems because he saw his father shot by a sniper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New arrivals in the UK such as Ahmad can't work until they have accommodation and their paperwork is in order. So he began volunteering with organisations such as Safe Passage, which helps find routes to asylum, as well as a charity that gives free bikes to refugees. He also volunteered as a caseworker for refugees who don't speak English. The Aleppo Supper Club employs refugees, and caters for charitable events across London. &quot;I present the culture of my city - the oldest inhabited city in the world - and give people a chance to know the story of every dish... I also do singing,&quot; he smiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellie Zeitlin, who works for Purpose in America, says: &quot;A lot of refugees have a hard time finding work and a lot of them become entrepreneurs. Many of them... are making businesses that could potentially hire people and create more jobs in this country - whereas a lot of the narratives we hear are that refugees are taking away jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the American dream to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and be self-determining and independent, and a lot of people we work with are living that story.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first group of refugees to be resettled under the Australia-United States resettlement deal flew out of Port Moresby on Tuesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group of 25 men from the Manus Island detention centre will be joined within days by a second group of refugees currently housed on Nauru. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beverly Thacker, public affairs officer for the US embassy in Papua New Guinea, said a total of 54 refugees from Manus and Nauru had been approved for resettlement &quot;at this time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  PNG tells Australia it can't leave Manus Island asylum seekers behind - report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other refugee cases are under review,&quot; Thacker told Guardian Australia. &quot;They all have different time frames and we will expect that others will be advanced in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US agreed to take a number of refugees from Australia's offshore detention facilities in a deal negotiated between the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the former US president Barack Obama - and begrudgingly upheld by Donald Trump, who dubbed it &quot;the worst deal ever. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original deal concerned the resettlement of up to 1,250 refugees from Manus and Nauru but the US is not obligated to take a certain number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thacker said the US would not comment on how many refugees might be approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also would not say where they would be placed but said they would &quot;go through the standard settlement process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first group approved for resettlement were informed just under a week ago, after an extensive screening and interview process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of 20 September, there were 928 men at the Manus Island centre and 1,135 people on Nauru, including 169 children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Law Centre's director of legal advocacy, Daniel Webb, said the first transfer flight was good news &quot;for a handful of people&quot; but left the bulk of the 2,000 people on Manus and Nauru behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After four years of fear, violence and limbo, safety for a handful isn't good enough,&quot; Webb said. &quot;It is our government's responsibility to make sure not a single person is left behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'You are worse than I am': Trump told Turnbull he admired offshore detention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone who can't go to America must immediately be bought to safety in Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens immigration spokesman, Nick McKim, said refugees on Manus and Nauru &quot;remain Australia's responsibility and must be brought to Australia so they can be looked after properly&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wish the people heading to the United States the very best,&quot; McKim said. &quot;We hope they can start to rebuild their lives after being treated so appallingly at Australia's hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus Island centre was scheduled to close on 31 October but the new PNG government is reportedly refusing to allow Australia to close the centre without a clear plan for the remaining detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planned closure was prompted by the PNG supreme court ruling that the men inside the centre had been illegally detained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contacted for comment, the Australian immigration department referred to a previous statement the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, made acknowledging the refugees' expected departure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AKM Iqbal Hossain, a police superintendent, said: &quot;As many private and social organisations are coming and distributing relief, sometimes chaos breaks out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unofficial method of delivering aid has also been criticised by relief agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some people jump up onto the relief trucks, they are beaten down by men with sticks, and children can often be missed by truck drivers, according to Corinne Ambler, spokeswoman for the International Federation of the Red Cross, who spoke to CNN.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslims flee violence in Burma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as relief agencies are prioritising aid for pregnant women and children, which is just enough to keep people alive, others can become desperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outpouring of Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority in Burma, was sparked after Rohingya militants killed 12 security officials at a government border post and the military reacted with strong violence, reportedly attacking civilians and burning villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burmese officials have even been accused of genocide and &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;, while the Government denied these claims and said it has been targeting terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burma government also said 176 out of 471 Rohingya villages have been abandoned, and has accused Muslims of &quot;destroying their own homes&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The border camps and the Rakhine state in western Burma are heavily restricted for journalists, who are left unable to verify reports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government maintains that Rohingya have never been an ethnic group in Burma - despite generations of families in the country - and has denied them citizenship. Many communitieswere living off food packages from charities until deliveries were suspended after 25August.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excerpt from report by German Deutschlandfunk radio on 14 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the point of view of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany should continue to play an active role in resolving global problems: the Federal Republic was currently much more committed than a few years ago, and that would have to be maintained, she said on DLF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I think of the refugee issue or of the partnership with Africa, I believe we have done a lot,&quot; Merkel said. &quot;But I also have to tell the people in Germany that we will continue to be engaged.&quot; Meanwhile, the link between, for example, bad conditions for people in Africa and migration streams has been well understood.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee issue not yet resolved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee crisis of 2015 must not repeat itself, the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] chairwoman stressed. However, it was regrettable that still no agreement existed in Europe about the distribution of the refugees. She intended to continue campaigning for a spirit of solidarity in sharing the burden, yet she knew that was a &quot;huge challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel also said that the refugee issue had not yet been resolved. However, a lot had been &quot;put in order and brought under control.&quot; That also included the agreement between the EU and Turkey. She continued to reject an upper limit for refugees, as demanded by the CSU [Christian social Union], as &quot;still not appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US position encouragement for Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With reference to the United States, Merkel said that US President Donald Trump's position to put America's economic interests first could be an &quot;encouragement to strengthen Europe.&quot; That also required Europe to take a common stand on foreign policy issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chancellor also commented on the conflict between the United States and North Korea. She urged to resolve it through peaceful means. The sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council were to be welcomed. What mattered now was to make sure that things were not decided by the &quot;frequency of rhetoric,&quot; but by finding new communication channels. It would be good in that context if a regular format was set up again to find a solution to the conflict. Especially the United States and China needed to cooperate on the issue again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to domestic policy, the CDU leader intends to maintain a good relationship with sister party CSU and its chairman Horst Seehofer. &quot;There is no need to dodge the issue: we do have major differences of opinion,&quot; she admitted. Meanwhile, however, &quot;many steps were taken&quot; in that regard. And the commonalities predominated, after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about a potential government coalition after the Bundestag election on 24 September, Merkel said that the CDU/CSU did not fight &quot;coalition campaigns,&quot; but wanted to make sure to be &quot;strong on our own.&quot; The CDU and the CSU would not enter into a coalition with the Left Party or the AfD [Alternative for Germany]. &quot;Everything else remains to be seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summit just &quot;first step&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the emissions scandal, the chancellor defended herself against criticism that she had been on vacation rather than take part in the recent diesel summit. A situation like that was always a matter of consideration, she said. The summit had been &quot;a first step,&quot; but &quot;others must follow.&quot; The next thing to do in the fall was to summarize all the measures taken so far. &quot;I will certainly be there then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel stressed that the automobile industry had made &quot;grave mistakes&quot; in the diesel scandal&quot; and had especially &quot;gambled away trust.&quot; Companies were now called upon to accept responsibility by providing software updates and replacement bonuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Improving infrastructure for electric cars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another need was to observe the guidelines on clean air in cities and conurbations. She would discuss appropriate measures with the communities affected in the near future. That also included the improvement of the charging infrastructure for electric cars. &quot;After all, it is of no use if people are willing to buy electric cars but have no chance to charge them either at their workplace or at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1540 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in Calais are suffering from trench foot as they are forced to live in squalid conditions without shelter or basic sanitation, The Independent has learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medics volunteering in northern France have warned that growing numbers of children and adults are being diagnosed with the condition, with new cases emerging every day and the severity reaching levels worse than they have ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 700 refugees, including more than 120 unaccompanied children, are currently sleeping rough in Calais and Dunkirk. Following the demolition of the Jungle camp last year, any makeshift shelters or settlements have been destroyed by police, leading to a situation where refugees are sleeping in bare woodland and often exposed to damp, insanitary and cold conditions for long periods of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Turvey, a medical student volunteering with charity Help Refugees in northern France, told The Independent he is seeing multiple cases of trench foot everyday, and estimates that at least half of refugees in the region are suffering from the condition or severe fungal infections on their feet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of feet problems, especially as this summer has been very wet. I've seen trench foot in a few of the places I've worked in, but the cases of it here are the worst I've ever seen,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is often combined with athletes' foot, and people are also suffering from really bad feet fungal infections. It's like when you go to the swimming pool and get soggy fingers, but on another level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The term &quot;trench foot&quot; originally stems from the condition suffered by soldiers in trenches during the First World War, which were coincidentally quite prominent around Calais and Dunkirk. It occurs when feet are exposed to water for weeks on end and unable to dry out, leading them to become numb, change colour and swell, and, if left untreated, can cause gangrene and possible foot amputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seeing trench foot on a soldier in a war is one thing, but seeing it on a 15-year-old boy or a six-year-old girl with it is completely unacceptable in the modern world, let alone in a developed country like France,&quot; Mr Turvey continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The potential for complications of gangrene and surgical debridement as the cases become more severe is highly likely, and it's likely to happen at some point, especially with winter and colder wetter nights in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've known of cases of trench foot cropping up here and there in the recent decades, often among homeless populations, but nowhere near on the scale that is being seeing among refugees in northern France, particularly with the torrential rain this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turvey, who worked in the Jungle last year before the site was demolished, said spending prolonged periods of time outside also means refugees were suffering from scabies and pressure sores from sleeping on hard ground, as well as wounds caused by attempts to mount lorries in the desperate pursuit to reach the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of refugees, including kids, have got pressure sores around their groin area and on their bottoms from where they've been sleeping on hard ground and bushes. Some of them have got really serious from where they've become infected,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's also a lot of Leishmaniasis, a tropical skin infection that gives them angry-looking ulcers that will leave life-long scars. And we do a lot of wound management, from grazes from falling over on the motorway to getting caught on barbed wire, to getting hit by trucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Jungle, there were several medical caravans, where volunteers were able to give people relevant medication where they could and write medical referral letters to push people onto clinics. But the absence of a fixed point and a lack of resources has meant medical volunteers are now limited to working from the back of car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no means of cleaning their clothes except in dirty water, and not enough socks to go around in the charity donations, refugees are routinely wearing damp clothing, causing trench foot and other conditions to worsen. Any attempts to provide treatment for skin infestations such as scabies are not working, because, on returning to the squalor, people are re-infected within days or weeks, volunteers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French state medical services generally refuse to treat refugees with conditions that are not immediately life-threatening, and people are reportedly often ignored or escorted out by police when they go to local hospitals suffering from trench foot and other conditions, which in turn makes many unwilling or afraid to go back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, I saw a group of boys who had been refused treatment in A&amp;E the night before. They had quite serious conditions, but the doctors and medical staff wouldn't see them,&quot; Mr Turvey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It happens a lot. They get kicked out and the police might get called. They're then scared they will be arrested or hurt by the police, so a lot of them won't take our instructions to go to hospital. We're then stuck in this situation where we're diagnosing conditions that are going to progress, but aren't able to get them treated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with their rapidly declining physical health, the mental wellbeing of refugees in the Calais region is said to be at an all-time low, with self-harm becoming increasingly common among both adults and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical professionals and voluntary child protection officers told The Independent people frequently have self-inflicted razor blade cuts and cigarette burns on their skin. Unaccompanied minors are a particular concern, with the number displaying destructive behaviours rising at an alarming rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandy O'Brien, who's been volunteering with the Refugee Youth Service for more than a year, said: &quot;Self harm is really, really common. The majority of kids display destructive behaviours towards themselves, whether it's smoking, drinking, or the more serious cases of serious self harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're seeing kids who very obviously have signs of depression, very low moods, and the longer that kids are here, the more these behaviours become predominant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She explained that when young people first arrive in Calais, they are often unaware of the challenges it will entail, but begin to show a &quot;slow deterioration of spirit and positivity&quot; as they become increasingly tired and worn down, leading them to turn to escapist behaviours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking for control often leads to the self harm. They're in control of nothing here. They're moved on by the police and pepper sprayed by them. They're constantly on the move,&quot; she continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Jungle camp there were spaces they could go to relax and spaces they could be around other children, but now that there's no camp there's just this big blurriness. There's no outside and inside, they're just constantly in motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Refugee Youth Service currently has around 130 under-18s on their database, including between 40 and 50 15-year-olds and around a dozen who are aged 13, while the rest are either 16 or 17. There is also an eight-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl on the database who are sleeping rough accompanied by their mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even just tracking the kids is so much harder than it was before. Before, you had a shelter number, you had groups of friends that would always come,&quot; Ms O'Brien said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now simply trying to keep hold of how many kids we have takes up so much of our time, taking away from the more important stuff. They should all really be having daily check-ins with someone, but it's just not a service we're able to provide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of July, the French government said it would provide water and sanitation to displaced people in Calais and open two reception centres away from the port after a court ordered it to end the inhuman treatment of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the authorities announced that they had delivered on these pledges, but while a number of sanitation facilities have been put in place, volunteers said it is still the &quot;bare minimum&quot; and is not sufficient for more than 700 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mobile water tank with 10 taps was installed, which is open for five hours a day, and 10 portable toilets were placed at the distribution point, but with no hygiene items provided. Two showers have also been installed at the hospital, but are limited for the use of women, children and those with recognised health conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annie Gavrilescu, regional manager for Help Refugees, said: &quot;The Calais authorities seem to be making efforts to improve living conditions for 750 refugees in Calais, but the provisions so far are absolutely minimal and tokenistic. The court order has not been meaningfully implemented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the Prefecture of the Nord-pas-de-Calais region said: &quot;Mobile facilities have been provided to improve conditions for migrants, while maintaining the objective reaffirmed by the public authorities and validated by the administrative judge not to reconstruct a camp in the Calais region and to avoid an uncontrolled influx of migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In addition, a shower facility already exists for the most vulnerable people (sick, women, children, the elderly, disabled people), which will be expanded before the end of August and will be accessed on the guidance of social workers or public health actors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These installations are not fixed; they can evolve according to realities and needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second year students Charlotte Allen, Scarlett Chetwin, Aoife O' Doherty, Ollie George and Lydia Barba devised Lemonaid in response to a project set by Amnesty International to encourage the public to welcome refugees arriving into the UK. As an aid for seasickness and a key cooking ingredient in a variety of dishes from different cultures, the lemon is a universal object used by people from all around the world - the ideal symbol to convey the group's message of unity and togetherness.<BR><BR>The young designers distributed the lemons to pedestrians on a busy Central London street, exchanging the fruit for signatures in support of Amnesty International, having originally designed a stand with accompanying artwork and graphics. 'We talked to members of the public about the work Amnesty International are doing to help refugees,' said award-winning group member Ollie George. 'If the commuters took their lemon away, used it as part of their supper that evening and stopped to think about how they can help refugees, our campaign achieved its goal,' the 21 year old from Hampshire said.<BR><BR>The success of the campaign prompted the group to submit their work to the Creative Conscience Awards, which encourages designers and artists to produce work with a positive social message.<BR><BR>Graphic design student Lydia Barba invites members of the public to support refugees.<BR><BR>Graphic design student Lydia Barba invites members of the public to support refugees.<BR><BR>The project had begun with a group discussion on recent world events and issues, prompting a passionate response from the student designers. 'As a group of designers, we discussed what mattered to us. The plight of refugees is something that has affected all of us through its depiction in the media.' Ollie explained. 'We're delighted to have won a Gold Award - it's a special feeling knowing that distinguished industry professionals rated our work and ideas.'<BR><BR>Senior lecturer of the BA (Hons) Graphic Design course Dr Cathy Gale praised the group's ability to convey their message to the public. 'Our students produced a campaign based on a simple object which emphasised the importance of humanity and truth,' she said. 'At Kingston University, we encourage our students to explore the socio-political context in which their work is carried out. The project set in collaboration with Amnesty International epitomises this.'<BR><BR>Ollie hopes the success of the award will provide a platform for creativity to motivate others. 'We are becoming more and more aware of our role as designers to ignite change and make people think differently about the world around them. The Creative Conscience Awards are an excellent organisation that actively encourages us as artists and designers to showcase these elements of our work,' he said.<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanese authorities have reportedly evacuated a Syrian refugee camp in the Bekaa Valley region, leaving dozens of families in the area without shelter on 25 December, a Lebanese relief agency has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On its Facebook page, the Beirut-based Sawa for Development and Aid reported on the same day that around 60 families were evacuated from the Delhamiyeh camp in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley without being given any alternative shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They became homeless on Christmas Eve,&quot; the organisation said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in barns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian opposition Journalist Mohammad Hasan also posted a video which he said was filmed from the Delhamiyeh area, where the refugees who were evacuated from the camp had been staying for the past few days. He noted that the families were warned two weeks ago that they would be evacuated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hasan noted on his Facebook page that the evacuations from the camp began three days ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The families are now staying in a barn used to raise cows, according to Hasan, who noted that the owner of the barn offered them the space after seeing their &quot;catastrophic&quot; situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hasan added that Delhamiyeh camp included around 62 tents housing over 70 families. &quot;Around 9 to 10 tents are left in the camp, and the people in the rest of the tents are now staying here. In two barns there are at least 250 people,&quot; the reporter said, adding that people do not have access to any of the basic necessities, including a proper shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video showed the area around the barns, with streets covered in mud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camera entered one of the barns, showing children and people walking around the area. People's belongings were seen piled around, without any proper facilities or shelter. The reporter noted that one curtained-off corner had around four or five families staying in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dire conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reporter asked one of the refugees to send a message to the international organisations that &quot;knew that the evacuations were going to happen, for the past two weeks, but they are still following [the events]&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wherever we go, wherever we move, they are evicting us,&quot; the woman said, noting that there is nowhere for them to go in this cold. She added: &quot;We are sitting in cow farms. Look at the rubbish, the smell. We have become ill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reporter then posted another video to highlight the current conditions in the camp, showing the remaining few tents, with children taking some of them down.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst the filming, people start calling for help to aid a child who fell as he tried to dismantle a tent. Hasan explained that this was not the first medical emergency, as a woman was injured by a metal pole that fell on her while a tent was being taken down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister calls for action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Lebanese minister of state for refugee affairs, Mouin Miraabi, called on the Ministry of Social Affairs to carry out all that is necessary to provide alternative camps for refugees in the eastern Bekaa Valley, the website of Lebanese privately-owned LBC TV reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said that the Lebanese army had warned the residents of several camps, including Delhamiyeh, to evacuate eight months ago. &quot;The teams of the Ministry of Social Affairs should have followed this issue up and redistributed the refugees among other camps in the Bekaa area,&quot; Miraabi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lebanese army and Hezbollah have recently cleared areas under the control of the jihadist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and so-called Islamic State (IS) on the border between Syria and Lebanon. Since then, people have voiced fears that Syrian refugees would be pushed to return to Syria from Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some commentators on Facebook questioned whether these evictions were an effort to force people to go back to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14 December, Syrian authorities announced that the Joussy crossing between areas in the Bekaa Valley and the Syrian city of Homs was reopened after four years of closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move could be a step towards pushing Syrian refugees and displaced people in the Lebanese border towns to return to Syria. &quot;There are currently no obstacles in front of any resident wishing to come back to Syria,&quot; Iranian Arabic-language Al-Alam TV quoted the Syrian interior minister as saying on 14 December.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Donald Trump told Australia's prime minister that a deal his predecessor struck up with the foreign government to accept&nbsp;1,250 refugees was going to get him 'killed' and that he would be 'seen as a weak and ineffective leader' if he honored it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump voiced his concerns to Turnbull in a phone call that took place eight days after he was inaugurated.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tone and tenor of the conversation were already known - The Washington Post  revealed snippets of the terse conversation several days later.&nbsp;The publication put out a full transcript of the conversation this morning, though, that reveals just how angry Trump was about the refugee deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous,' Trump tells Turnbull near the end of the January call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump took the Oath of Office on Jan. 20. He spoke to Turnbull over the phone on Jan. 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the call the new president repeatedly misstated the number of refugees the U.S. had agreed to take on and opined that the deal put him in a 'bad position' his first week on the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Trump's first acts in office had been to sign a refugee ban prohibiting arrivals from citizens of seven countries on a temporary basis.&nbsp;The group included Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's administration had previously agreed to accept 1,250 refugees of those nationalities who were being held in detention centers of Australia's coast in Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions at the detention centers had prompted United Nations condemnation. The U.S. said it would take in half of the population, so long as they passed security screening tests that other refugees have also been submitted to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 1 the US embassy in Canberra said President Trump would honor the deal with Australia, despite his signing of the executive order barring other refugees from those countries from setting foot on US soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not too long after Trump tweeted: 'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His tweet cast the United States' commitment to the deal into doubt, as well as its relationship with Australia, a key ally that it shares intelligence with as part of the 'Five Eyes' agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Mike Pence assured Australians in April during a visit to Sydney that the U.S. would honor the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But it doesn't mean we admire the agreement,' Pence said during a news conference. 'Frankly looking back at the last administration, the President has never been shy about expressing frustration with other international agreements, most notably the so-called nuclear agreement with Iran.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Trump sat down with Turnbull in May for a conversation aboard the Intrepid in New York, he told reporters that earlier characterizations of their call were off base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We had a great telephone call. You guys exaggerated that call. That was a big exaggeration. We're not babies. That was a little bit of fake news,' he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post had put out portions of the call to that point, but not the full transcript. An unedited copy of the conversation that it posted to its website this morning backs up its previous assertions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump suggested during the talk with Turnbull that he could reneg on the deal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I do not know what he got out of it. We never get anything out of it - START Treaty, the Iran deal. I do not know where they find these people to make these stupid deals. I am going to get killed on this thing,' on this thing.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull assures him, 'You will not.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump pushes back and tells him, 'Yes, I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his counterpart says: 'You can certainly say that it was not a deal that you would have done, but you are going to stick with it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am going to say that I have no choice but to honor my predecessor's deal. I think it is a horrible deal, a disgusting deal that I would have never made. It is an embarrassment to the United States of America and you can say it just the way I said it. I will say it just that way,' Trump tells him. 'As far as I am concerned that is enough Malcom.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Trump fumes, 'I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, 'This is crazy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull attempted to end the call on a high note, telling Trump, 'Thank you for your commitment. It is very important to us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is important to you and it is embarrassing to me. It is an embarrassment to me, but at least I got you off the hook. So you put me back on the hook,' Trump replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian leader stressed to Trump that he wouldn't regret it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You can count on me. I will be there again and again,' Turnbull asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calming down, Trump told him, 'I hope so. Okay, thank you Malcolm.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Okay, thank you,' Turnbull said before they disconnected.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Donald Trump has proposed admitting no more than 45,000 refugees to the United States, continuing his streak of stringent immigration measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That cap would impose the toughest limit in decades despite what humanitarian groups have called a global refugee crisis, with the United Nations reporting that 65.6 million people - the most on record - were displaced in 2016. By contrast, former president Barack Obama had moved to allow 110,000 refugees into the country in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump has made limiting immigration, both legal and illegal, a centrepiece of his policy agenda. He has sought to augment deportations of immigrants in the country illegally and to block more illegal entries by erecting a border wall between the US and Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrests of undocumented immigrants rose this year compared to 2016 andborder apprehensions surged by 60 per cent this summer, according to federal data,though Mr Trump has yet to convince Congress to fund his wall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also taken aim at legal migration, embracing a bill that would have slashed admittances and enacting a ban on travellers from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such measures have been popular with Trump supporters who gravitated toward his nativist message. Republican lawmakers praised Mr Trump's refugee limit, saying it would help safeguard national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Trump Administration's refugee ceiling for the coming year maintains our nation's generosity toward those in need, and importantly, ensures limited resources are used wisely and our citizens are protected in light of ongoing terrorist threats,&quot;RepresentativeBob Goodlatte - a Virginia Republican who heads the committee that oversees immigration - said in a statement, arguing that the new level would help reduce a backlog caused by a flood of asylum-seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democrats and humanitarian groups reacted with dismay to Mr Trump's announcement, saying it forfeited America's moral authority and ceded the country's role as a shelter for the persecuted.</SPAN></P>

Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois called the move &quot;unconscionable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since our nation's tragic failure to help Jewish refugees fleeing Hitler, we have set an example for the world by providing safe haven to the world's most vulnerable people&quot;, MrDurbin said in a statement, calling Mr Trump's proposal &quot;an abdication&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year on from the demolition of the notorious Calais Jungle, as the number of displaced people in the area creeps up to an estimated 2,000,a body of new evidence seen exclusively by </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indicates that officers are threatening to split up families, tearing up refugees' tents and in some cases beating people with batons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other testimonies reveal refugees have been held for long periods of time in the local police station, with one family telling how they were detained for an entire day, during which time they were given no food or clean nappies for their young baby.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calais: 'Dogs are allowed in cars here, but refugees not'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have also been seen confiscating and sometimes destroying refugees' belongings, such as their phones or shoes. One video shows a male refugee on the ground with three police officers standing around him, one of whom appears to kick his mobile phone onto the road and knock it down a drain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes in the same week the French government condemned the &quot;abuse&quot; of tear gas and the &quot;destruction of migrants' personal belongings&quot; by police in the region after state investigators confirmed in a government-commissioned report that abuses were taking police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation, requested by the interior ministry in response to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) in July, found that police routinely use chemical sprays on refugees, including children, while they were sleeping and in other circumstances where they posed no threat. Officers also regularly spray or confiscate sleeping bags, blankets, and clothing, apparently to press people to leave the area, investigators found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new evidence of police abuses, gathered by Humans for Rights Network, confirms these abuses, and also highlights cases where police have forced sleeping children out of their tents and threatened to split up families, as well as in one case reportedly beating a male refugee to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Iraqi Kurdish woman told how one morning police came and opened the zip of the tent where her two- and four-year-old children were sleeping, ordering them toleave as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were a lot of police around, maybe 50 or 60. Some of them told me and my children to go by the lake where there were many other refugees,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of refugees become targets for smugglers in northern France</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We went there and we were all sat down in the middle of a circle of police with linked hands to trap us inside. An interpreter with the police said there was a decision from the government that if we don't go with them, they will separate families and send the husband to prison for two years. They said they would remove the children from their families. The families were very scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another case, three adults and an eight-month-old baby were hiding in the back of a lorry near Dunkirk overnight, before they were reported by the driver to police. Two officers opened the lorry doors and took the family to the police station, where they remained in a cell until around 5pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this time, the report states that the father of the baby requested a glass of water for his wife, which arrived three hours later. When the baby soiled her clothes the family asked the police to allow them to change her and put the dirty nappy outside the room. The police laughed and allowed them out over an hour later, and they did not provide the baby any clean nappies or clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adults received a small portion of rice each and one bottle of water between them but there was no food or milk provided for the baby for the whole day. Once all family members had been interviewed individually, they were released with no resources to help them travel back to the informal camp where they had been sleeping in Dunkirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, a 25-year-old woman in Calais told researchers she witnessed another woman of her age being sprayed with tear gas by police. &quot;There were two policemen surrounding her. She turned away from the one in front and the one behind sprayed her in the face,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They sprayed for a long time and then when she turned away the one in front of her sprayed her in the face also. After the second spray she fell over, when she got up they sprayed again. She ran for about 15 minutes but couldn't see anything. She fell into a some water with all her clothes on and her phone in her pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee explains what it's like sleeping rough in Calais</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police followed her and when they saw her in the lake they got in the car and drove away. She shouted for help and some Eritrean men helped her to get out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 17-year-old girl, also living in Calais, said she had been sprayed with CS gas multiple times by police when discovered in lorries. She said she &quot;became blind&quot; the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When describing the last time she was sprayed, she said: &quot;My eyes, my throat and my nose were irritated. Still now my throat is a problem, the gas entered my stomach and I have problems with my stomach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One 35-year-old man, who wore a cast on his arm, told researchers that as he was walking to the food distribution point he was approached by police who beat him on the ground, leading to him breaking his arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fell down and they hit me on my arm. They then pushed my head into the ground. I was just coming to get food. They hit me two times on the arm. There were three police. They hit me with the big baton,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Maddie Harris)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After they told me to go, my head was in pain and I had no strength. Three of my friends came and helped me to go to hospital. I had an x-ray and they said my arm was broken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddie Harris, who led the research, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the violence was &quot;constant&quot;, with many refugees having been victim to &quot;unprovoked extreme&quot; violence by police multiple times during their time in Calais or Dunkirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officers, particularly the riot police (Compagnies r&eacute;publicaines de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, CRS) appear to have no issue subjecting vulnerable migrants and asylum seekers, including unaccompanied children, to repeated exposure to tear gas, beatings and repeated destruction and confiscation of possessions such as sleeping bags, blankets, phones and shoes,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When giving testimony, most migrant and asylum seekers talk of multiple incidents where they have been the victim of unprovoked extreme violence at the hands of the police. One particular unaccompanied minor, when talking of an incident where he was beaten by the police, told me he had been gassed on three separate occasions in one day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have personally witnessed numerous evictions and confiscations of possessions, unprovoked beatings, violent arrests and use of tear gas. I have also seen the physical results of these actions, from young boys walking in the rain with no shoes, to the physical scars on the faces of unaccompanied minors. The officers in question act with complete impunity and show no signs of adhering to their code of conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the French government's condemnation of the police abuses, Michael Bochenek, senior counsel to the Children's Rights Division of HRW, said it was &quot;welcome&quot; that the state had acknowledged and condemned the issue, but warned that as winter approaches the &quot;pervasive policing&quot; must urgently stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The investigators received pretty consistent accounts the same as we and others documented, including things like tear-gassing kids in the face while they sleep, taking their sleeping bags,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's welcome to get that official acknowledgement that this problem is going on, and that they looked at the full range of concerns that we had. Now, particularly as the days grow shorter and the temperatures drop, people will have serious humanitarian needs and this kind of pervasive policing we've been seeing that gives rise to abusive practices must stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When confronted with the new allegations, the local authority for the Calais region did not respond to them directly, butreferred to a previous statement stating that following the state-commissioned report the Minister of the Interior had orderedpolice chiefs in the regionto remind officers of the regulations they must comply to, especially during dismantling operations of the unofficial camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wishes to renew his confidence in the police forces whose intervention is carried out in Calais and Dunkirk in a particularly difficult context,&quot; the local authority said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">888 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a bleeding-heart - but busy - liberal, it's tough trying to remember what you were last outraged about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You remember signing a lot of petitions, carefully choosing which kind of emoji face to use on Facebook (&quot;wows&quot; are never OK) and furiously tweeting. You may have even made a witty banner and gone on a wee march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then the news cycle moves on, and you get on with your busy life - and before you know it, there's a new hashtag movement in town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the issues remain as difficult as they ever were. Like the child refugees who are still alone in the woods near Calais and Dunkirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee camp at Calais known as the Jungle was demolished a year ago but children are still there alone and the conditions are even worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday I attended a demonstration outside Parliament organised by the charities Help Refugees and Safe Passage to thank politicians for what has been done but to remind them that Britain promised to take 480 child refugees and yet only 200 of them are here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was an eclectic gathering of people of all ages, from all backgrounds and faiths, and there were a number of young refugees who had been brought over from Calais as a result of the Dubs Amendment. I am not a great one for protests but this was genuinely moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in attendance was the architect of the campaign, Lord Dubs, who came to this country as a child refugee on Kindertransport, actress Juliet Stevenson and Camilla Thurlow from the reality TV hit Love Island. I know... that's mainly why I went, to be honest. Thankfully, I managed to restrain myself from asking deeply inappropriate questions about who got off with whom in the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, Camilla had just returned from France and she told me how adults and children now sleep outside in the open with no tents, and sometimes have their sleeping bags and blanket confiscated by the French police. And how mothers live with their toddlers among open sewage with nowhere to wash properly. When your eyes are open to this, it's hard to close them. And all of this is happening just over an hour away from us. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Dubs is practical about the challenge. We can't take everyone but we can at least fill the 480 places promised by the Government before the temperature drops and rescue more children by Christmas. Many already have family here and under a European Union agreement they can be reunited with them, although there are fears that Brexit will jeopardise that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we prepare to leave the EU it is all the more important to send a message about Britain's place in the world and that we take our moral international obligations seriously - even the most ardent Brexiteer can see that is a proud part of our heritage and brand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the heat of the domestic row over immigration, freedom of labour and targets, it's easy to forget about the 280 children we promised safe passage to and still haven't. MPs must work with local authorities to make it happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How we honour our obligation on child refugees is a test of our national conscience, character and humanity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How we honour our obligation on child refugees is a test of our national conscience, character and humanity. I spoke to young people from Syria and Sudan. Their gratitude was simple and their message overwhelming: we lost our country and you gave us a home. Thank you for bringing us to safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot save every child but we can save some, and surely, we must.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillian gets my royal approval</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Netflix struck TV gold with The Crown, which has attracted critical acclaim and is also incredibly popular with the punters - a bit like Her Majesty herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be six series in total spanning Queen Elizabeth's life and three actresses will share the role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Series two is about to start starring Claire Foy, who has already won awards for her portrayal of the young Queen finding her feet, but this will be her last - and Netflix is casting for who to play the Queen for her middle years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are sizeable royal slippers to fill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillian Anderson (Getty Images)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many names are in the frame but I would like to see Gillian Anderson get the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although best known for Agent Scully in the The X-Files, I loved her in the gritty police drama The Fall, where she played DSI Stella Gibson with elegance and steel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson is a fabulous actress who is able to portray strong, complex female characters with a sense of regal restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a no-brainer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone else and one will not be amused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laughing all the way to a political punch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Death Of Stalin - Trailer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian Revolution started 100 years ago today. It changed the course of Western history and had a profound impact on politics. Its themes still loom large: anger, discontent, class struggle and a thirst for revolution. But that's enough about the Labour Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armando Iannucci's new film, The Death of Stalin, is a sharp satire about what came next. It focuses on the death of Joseph Stalin and all the craven plotting and scheming about who should succeed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dark humour oozes from this film like the urine from Stalin's corpse and because of that, its timely lessons are all the more powerful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It depicts the horror of Stalin's blood-soaked dictatorship and the dangers of creating populist demagogues. As a stand-up, I know humour can deliver a political punch better than something dull and earnest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make people laugh and you have their attention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S been two years since the harrowing image of Syrian three-year-old Alan Kurdi lying dead on a Turkish beach shocked the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's horrifying that since then the UN estimate a further 8500 people have died while attempting to make the hazardous journey across the Mediterranean Sea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the UK Government was slow to respond, Scotland has been able to provide safety and sanctuary to around 1850 Syrian refugees, under the Syrian Resettlement Programme, since October 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">READ MORE:&nbsp;In the two years since Alan Kurdi died, at least 8500 more refugees have perished</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we stand ready to help more people as and when required. Our New Scots refugee integration strategy provided a strong base for Scotland's response to the humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And over the last two years we have worked closely with Cosla and local authorities, as well as the third sector and community organisations, to get the right support in place to help refugees settle into safe new homes and be able to begin to rebuild their lives in our communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been fantastic to see people extend the hand of friendship to their new neighbours. However, adjusting to a new and very different country takes time, and we must recognise the difficulties people face and learn from them. People have had their lives turned upside down and often lost everything, through no fault of their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some also face significant challenges from disability and ill health and, of course, a language barrier. We continue to work to overcome any barriers to education and opportunities to work, and will tackle health and housing inequalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One issue raised regularly by the refugees is family reunion. Many of them have had to leave members of their families in Syria or other neighbouring countries and are extremely anxious for their safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have sought improvements to the family reunion process from the UK Government - for all refugees in Scotland, not just those who have arrived through the Syrian Programme, and we are working to simplify access to crisis funds for those who need initial support when they arrive through the family reunion programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will always prioritise the rights of the child. Most children in Scotland will have the love and protection of a family. For lone and lonely child refugees with no family, no emotional or practical support, to have lost loved ones and homes is unimaginable and unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland has provided a place of safety for 35 children through the Dubs amendment but we are ready to offer refuge to more vulnerable, unaccompanied children who have found themselves displaced and separated from their families and homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am therefore appalled the UK Government ended the Dubs amendment early and have written to the UK Government urging them to listen to the people of Scotland and around the world, who have stated time and again we must prioritise these children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland stands willing, ready and able to provide a safe haven for more children as and when the UK Government acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papua New Guinean defence forces will take no &quot;arbitrary action&quot; against the men who refuse to leave the detention centre inside Lombrum naval base, its commanding officer has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the CO, Begsy Karaki, said the group would be forcefully removed if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The Australian-run detention centre closed on Tuesday evening. Refugees and asylum seekers were ordered to move to alternative accommodation units built in the nearby town of Lorengau but they refused, citing fears for their safety outside the compound.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karaki told the Post Courier and confirmed to the Guardian the men were still under the care of the PNG immigration office and Australia, and his officers would not take action against them unless instructed to by headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The refugees are in a state of terror on Manus | Behrouz Boochani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was &quot;no threat&quot; or panic. &quot;This is Australia's problem now being brought in here, and we are getting blamed for issues we did not create,&quot; Karaki said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot get involved, we have no say in this, but because they are placed here at our military camp, we hope there are some solutions quickly, so we carry on with our duties and tasks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting chief migration officer, Solomon Kantha, said the men were free to leave the centre but anyone who did would not be allowed to return. Buses for people who volunteered to leave had been on standby since Wednesday morning, he told the Post Courier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent move to address the detainees' main concerns about safety in the new accommodation, Kantha said he was speaking with contractors about installing fences and security at the new sites, and was exploring curfew options. &quot;Manus is a peaceful place but we have to have these measures in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 600 men remain in the detention centre after two nights without electricity, food or water. They collected some rainwater and, overnight on Wednesday, some of them dug a well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were digging for hours and finally found water,&quot; reported the Kurdish Iranian journalist and refugee Behrouz Boochani. &quot;I don't know if this water is clean enough to drink or not, but the refugees are drinking from it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani said the men were supporting each other but the health of many was deteriorating, including an epileptic man who experienced a medical incident, one man who self-harmed, and two others who had infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are asking international organisations like Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders to take action and help us,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a hunger strike. It is a situation that the Australian government has created, forcing people into starvation and these harsh conditions by refusing to offer a safe place for resettlement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PNG and Australian governments are also in a standoff, as Australia refers all queries and responsibilities to PNG, but PNG maintains it has fulfilled its processing and resettlement obligations. The remaining refugees and unsuccessful asylum seekers are for Australia to deal with, it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kantha said he had urgently requested a meeting with Australian government officials to discuss &quot;a clear way forward&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A longstanding offer by New Zealand to take 150 refugees from Australia's offshore processing centres has resurfaced, after the country's newly elected prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, revealed she would raise the issue when she meets Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think anyone would look at a situation like that and see the human face of what is an issue that New Zealand is in the lucky position of not having to struggle with, [as] Australia has,&quot; Ardern said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am looking forward, though, to having a conversation directly with the prime minister on Sunday about some of those issues - and New Zealand's role and view on Manus Island in particular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees and asylum seekers have repeatedly said they are not safe in the Lorengau community. Attacks by locals have been detailed by Human Rights Watch, including violent robberies by groups of men wielding knives and other weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the detainees also have support among Manusians. Hundreds attended a protest and signed a petition calling on the Australian government to respect human rights and resettle the refugees rather than leave them in PNG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani said he appreciated the locals' protest. &quot;Local fear is logical because their small community has not this capacity to accept 600 foreign men and if the government sends the refugees into the communities, it will be dangerous and we will see conflict between locals and refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ron Knight, a former MP for Manus province, said local people's main grievance was with the Australian government, not the refugees and asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The perceptions is they're quite disappointed with Australia for creating the mess in the first place,&quot; Knight told the Guardian. &quot;They can't understand how a country can abandon people like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Knight added that Manusians were &quot;adamant&quot; they didn't want the refugees living in their community, citing criminal allegations ranging from minor offences to sexual assault, and sexual relationships with local women resulting in pregnancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said most of the men now holed up in the centre rarely came to town but locals were fearful of what would happen when 600 more men joined the Lorengau community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the other side we have the asylum seekers - I've heard horror stories,&quot; Knight said. &quot;Some have been chopped up by idiots, attacked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know the cause, some are spontaneous, some have reasons. They don't want to come here either, they want to live somewhere safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Behrouz Boochani wins Amnesty International award for writing from Manus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight suggested that an expanded and &quot;beefed up&quot; East Lorengau transit centre, which is fenced in and next door to a medical clinic but now only has capacity for about 300 people, could provide a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said fears the 600 would be attacked were unnecessary. &quot;The issue is with the authorities, not with the asylum seekers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, accused refugee advocates of encouraging the men to stand their ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to close Manus Island as quickly as possible,&quot; he told Channel Nine. &quot;It doesn't help when you have got the Greens telling people not to engage and move. It makes a difficult situation even worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani denied Dutton's claims. &quot;Peter Dutton can't blame advocates who support innocent people in Manus. Refugees themselves are fighting for their rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton's office has been contacted for comment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU could scrap a divisive scheme that compels member states to accept quotas of refugees, one of the bloc's most senior leaders will say this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, will tell EU leaders at a summit on Thursday that mandatory quotas have been &quot;divisive and ineffective&quot;, in a clear sign that he is ready to abandon the policy that has created bitter splits across the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tusk will set a six-month deadline for EU leaders to reach unanimous agreement on reforms to the European asylum system, but will propose alternatives if there is no consensus. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is no solution by [June 2018], including on the issue of mandatory quotas, the president of the European council will present a way forward,&quot; states a draft letter from Tusk to national capitals, seen by the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect, this means scrapping mandatory quotas, as Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic are fiercely opposed to the idea of dispersing refugees around the bloc based on a formula drawn up in Brussels. Tusk is likely to face opposition, however, from other EU bodies, including the European commission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU leaders introduced compulsory quotas in 2015 at the height of the migration crisis, as thousands of people arrived daily on Europe's shores, many of whom were refugees from Syria, Iraq and Eritrea. Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and the Czech Republic voted against the move, but the policy was forced through by a majority vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary and Poland have defied the rest of the EU by not taking a single refugee under the scheme, which aimed to relocate about 120,000, mainly Syrian, refugees, while the Czech republic has taken in only 12. All three countries were referred to the European court of justice last week for failing to implement the policy, the usual procedure for flouting EU rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the backlash against the emergency scheme, the European commission proposed in 2016 to make quotas a permanent feature of EU law. Under the commission proposal, countries that refuse to take part in a &quot;corrective allocation mechanism&quot; to take the pressure off member states bearing the brunt would have to pay a &quot;solidarity contribution&quot; of (EURO)250,000 (&pound;220,000) per asylum seeker. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea has been stalled for months, as home affairs ministers who make the law have been unable to agree on it. Any move to drop the plan is likely to upset Italy and Greece, countries that have urged the rest of the EU to help them cope with large numbers of refugees and migrants in recent years. Germany and Sweden, backed by the European commission, are also likely to contest any plan deemed to reduce the help offered by other member states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One EU diplomat said some member states were surprised by Tusk's letter &quot;because it doesn't seem to be in sync&quot; with work undertaken by home affairs ministers working on the file. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, thinks mandatory quotas have been a gift to hardliners, such as the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb&aacute;n, who has seized on migration as part of his wider &quot;Stop Brussels&quot; campaign. Eurosceptics in Poland, such as the Law and Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski - whose party won an election victory over Tusk's centre-right group in October 2015 - have also criticised the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tusk's scepticism about the prospect of consensus has been evident for months: in October, he said mandatory quotas had put members states in almost &quot;permanent conflict&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tusk will call on EU governments to take charge, rather than allowing Brussels setting the pace in managing refugee policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only member states are able to tackle the migration crisis effectively,&quot; states Tusk's letter. &quot;The EU's role is to offer its full support in all possible ways to help member states handle the migration crisis. But the EU has neither the capacity nor legal possibilities to replace member states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European president will also urge EU leaders to spend more on schemes aimed at keeping refugees and would-be migrants outside Europe, such as (EURO)3bn for Syrian refugees in Turkey and the (EURO)1.9bn EU Africa trust fund. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spring 2018, the EU will confront an earlier promise to give Turkey's government a further (EURO)3bn to help Syrian refugees, which could lead to a repeat of EU institutions asking governments to find more cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU has improvised such schemes in response to crises, but Tusk wants more funds available from the new seven-year budget covering the period from 2021, which will come up for discussion next year. He is calling for &quot;stable and long-term financing mechanisms, in place of the existing ad hoc pledging on a much larger scale&quot;, but has stopped short of putting a price tag on future migration policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Huge crowds gather as food is distributed by a local NGO near the Balukali refugee camp[/caption]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of additional Rohingya Muslims are said to be making the perilous journey on foot towards the border, or paying smugglers to take them across by water in wooden boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivors arrive with horrifying accounts of rape, murder and villages being burned down in the &quot;clearance operations&quot; by army and Buddhist mobs in Burma, which is also known as Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killings were sparked by militant attacks on security posts in Rakhine state in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the Rohingya refugees flee to is a different kind of suffering in sprawling makeshift camps in Bangladesh rife with fears of malnutrition, cholera, and other diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than half a million Rohingya refugees have flooded into Bangladesh to flee an offensive by Myanmar's military[/caption]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since August 25 about 536,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning a seemingly never-ending flow entered Bangladesh near the village of Palongkhali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many were injured, with the elderly carried on makeshift stretchers, while women balanced household items, such as pots, rice sacks and clothing, on their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We couldn't step out of the house for the last month because the military were looting people,&quot; said Mohammad Shoaib, 29, who wore a yellow vest and balanced jute bags of food and aluminium pots on a bamboo pole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They started firing on the village. So we escaped into another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Day by day, things kept getting worse, so we started moving towards Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we left, I went back near my village to see my house, and the entire village was burnt down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the Red Cross opened a field hospital as big as two football fields, with 60 beds, three wards, an operating theatre, a delivery suite with maternity ward and a psychosocial support unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We fled from our home because we had nothing to eat in my village,&quot; said Jarhni Ahlong, a 28-year-old Rohingya man from the southern region of Buthidaung.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detainees on Manus Island have been told they face &quot;removal from an active PNG military base&quot; if they refuse to leave the detention centre, and locals report police squads have armed themselves &quot;like they are going to war&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detainees have also alleged local men started looting the centre once staff departed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian-run immigration detention centre was scheduled to close by 5pm on Tuesday but no immediate action was taken against the 600 remaining refugees. The situation threatens to devolve as about 600 refugees and asylum seekers refuse to leave the centre and local Manusian people protest about the cohort's resettlement in their community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For several months refugees and asylum seekers have been told they must move into alternative accommodation in nearby communities, as the centre was shut down around them. In recent days food packs were distributed with a warning there would be no more provided.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island detainees launch legal action over Australian centre's closure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late on Monday night a notice was put up inside the centre telling detainees the centre would be closed at 5pm Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All power and water will cease,&quot; it said. &quot;There will be no food supplied and no dinner service this evening. All ICSA personnel will depart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From tomorrow, arrangements will be underway for the return of the site to the PNG [defence force]. Anyone choosing to remain here will be liable for removal from an active PNG military base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By midday on Tuesday, Australian Border Force, Broadspectrum and Wilson Security staff members had reportedly left the island. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PNG security provider, Palladian, is believed to have at least 40 security officers fewer than it expected, after two groups of foreign-hired employees were prevented from entering the country by the immigration department, which said Palladian had to hire locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several detainees separately alleged locals carrying machetes had arrived at the centre and taken away fans, furniture and other items. The Guardian has seen footage and photos purported to show this but has not been able to confirm it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aziz Adam told the Guardian local Manusians had arrived on foot and with cars &quot;to steal things&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdul Mohammad told Australian Associated Press: &quot;Some of the locals have come inside and are stealing boxes, fire alarms, the fans. Some of them are taking the air conditioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My boys advise that there is serious looting by locals and disgruntled workers not paid their entitlements. What a waste of money.- Ron Knight (@pontuna2run) October 31, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a translated message one refugee said they had attempted to shut the centre gates with wire in fear of attacks. Refugees have been catching rainwater using bins and containers for drinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish Iranian journalist inside the centre, said detainees had been awake most of Monday night and were afraid to leave. He told the Guardian the situation was &quot;critical&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time I have to say SOS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its time I have to say SOS. The refugees are extremely scared. The situation is critical. Any time we are expecting attack by Navy.- Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) October 31, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday night he reported power had been cut in one of the compounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The power already cut in Oscar compound. The refugees are moving to Foxtrot right now. Its so dark and scary.- Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) October 31, 2017</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International investigators are in the area, monitoring the situation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Asia-Pacific researcher Kate Schuetze said fear, confusion and tension were high among both the detainees and local people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A local community group we spoke to [on Monday] said there were three mobile squads and PNGDF squads, and their comment was PNG forces are arming themselves like it's a war,&quot; Schuetze told the Guardian. &quot;It begs the question: who are they expecting a fight from? Refugees? Locals?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian Greens senator Nick McKim was in Lorengau on Tuesday and told the Guardian he had seen large numbers of police and defence personnel on the street but could not make an assessment about how equipped they were, noting he had mostly seen vehicle convoys driving through town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKim said he had &quot;grave fears&quot; for the safety of detainees and was heading to the detention centre, which he had permission to visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Diary of disaster: the last days inside Manus Island detention centre | Behrouz Boochani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last staff have now been withdrawn from the centre - there's nobody else in the centre except detainees,&quot; he said. &quot;They are at the mercy of the PNG navy, who stormed the centre earlier this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKim said he was speaking with detainees who had &quot;barricaded&quot; themselves inside the base, where there was no food or drinking water, and &quot;major hygiene issues&quot; with essential services cut off and most toilets blocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an humanitarian emergency driven by Pete Dutton and Malcolm Turnbull and acquiesced to by the Australian Labor party,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKim said he was at a rally where about 100 locals were presenting a petition calling for Australia to take the refugees and asylum seekers. The Manus Alliance Against Human Rights Abuses has previously spoken about a lack of consultation with the Manus community sparking fear of detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch last week detailed numerous attacks on refugees and asylum seekers by groups of locals who were often armed and drunk, with at least three victims requiring medical transfer to Port Moresby or Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locals have also protested against the building of refugee accommodation units on private land in communities, saying it was done without consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Schuetze and McKim said the alternative accommodation units were not yet ready for residents. Footage taken by Amnesty International purported to show the Hillside Haus centre unfinished and full of shipping containers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Papua New Guinea tells Australia it must resettle refugees unwilling to stay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers were expected to launch legal action over the closure in the PNG supreme court, alleging the detainees' human rights were being breached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a developing stoush between the Australian and PNG governments over who is responsible for refugees and asylum seekers who won't settle in PNG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IHMS clinic inside the centre has also closed. Staff have left and all medication and equipment has been removed, however it is not clear whether the new clinic - to be housed at the East Lorengau transit centre - is operational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the Guardian reported IHMS had been contracted to stay on beyond Tuesday and continue to provide medical care to detainees. The length of the Manus Island services has not been defined but a statement from IHMS said the Port Moresby health liaison services - for detainees transferred from Manus - would continue until 28 February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions to IHMS were referred to the Australian immigration department, which did not answer questions but said alternative accommodation was ready, with appropriate services and conditions similar to those at the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manner of the centre's closure has sparked renewed protests in Australia and among advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You have to get those poor bastards on Manus to safety TODAY @TurnbullMalcolm Like to Australia.Do your humanitarian duty man.- Sam Neill (@TwoPaddocks) October 30, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labor immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, said: &quot;Peter Dutton's failure to answer basic questions about arrangements in PNG after the closure of the regional processing centre has fuelled refugees' uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Transferring refugees from one centre to another is not a long term solution. These people urgently need viable third-country resettlement options.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent MP Andrew Wilkie supported the calls for detainees to be brought to Australia for processing and resettlement if their refugees claims were accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Make no mistakes - today's botched closure of the Manus Island detention centre is not good news for the nearly 750 men imprisoned there,&quot; Wilkie said. &quot;If the Australian government is going to lock people up in these camps they at least have a duty of care to ensure that they are treated humanely and have access to basic medical facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking on refugees could be the key to addressing Scotland's chronic skills shortages, business leaders are to be told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2,000 Syrians, many of them professionals, have settled across the country over the past two years. They, and others who have been granted refugee status, have national insurance numbers and are permitted to work at any skill level.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Sabir Zazai, the new chief executive of the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC), claims that businesses are failing to take advantage of this much-needed pool of fresh talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He plans to meet business leaders to urge them to consider launching employment placements for new arrivals. Mr Zazai, a former asylum seeker, is convinced that improving employability is the key to securing community cohesion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;When I arrived in the UK from Afghanistan the community welcomed me and invested in me. I will always be grateful for that. I volunteered and then worked and now I'm here today as the chief executive of the SRC. I'm not special or unique in any way and I know that every one of the people arriving here has got something to offer, if they are given a chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I want to send out the message that these people are not a burden, quite the opposite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new arrivals from Syria and else-where include engineers, doctors, accountants, architects, translators and IT professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zazai plans to lobby on their behalf and said: &quot;I'll be personally reaching out to businesses, Scottish Power, KPMG, Arnold Clark, Starbucks and many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The message I'll take to them is that they have a lot to benefit from giving a chance to refugees. Scotland has got skills shortages in a number of areas and we have got people who can be put to work straightaway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like everyone else, these people want to be able to provide for their families and feel that sense of pride in playing an active and productive role in their community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he stressed that he did not want refugees to get preferential treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want the jobs to be fairly available to all the members of the community, but if there is scope for these businesses to give people work experience they will benefit enormously,&quot; he said. &quot;They will be their future employees and customers. These are really challenging times, economically, politically and socially. We need to be smart enough in Scotland to harness migration for our economic and social benefit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zazai took up his SRC role at the beginning of September after working with refugee organisations in Coventry to where he was dispersed when he arrived in Britain in 1999. He also plans to make English lessons and additional support for refugees a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;People need to be able to speak the language so they can engage with the local community, make a contribution and avoid isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't want them to be a parallel community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said: &quot;There are sectors in the Scottish economy, for example digital and engineering, which have a worrying skills shortage that needs to be quickly addressed. We see no downside in this idea, and ask members to consider the benefits of engaging with refugees who were skilled professionals in their home countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;They have escaped slaughter, rape and starvation. But for the vulnerable Rohingya refugees who have fled persecution at the hands of the Myanmar army there is no guarantee of safety.&amp;#160;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women and vulnerable young girls are being stalked inside refugee camps by gangs of pimps who need women to supply Bangladesh's notorious sex trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They look for widows because they are alone or orphans who have nobody to protect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">::</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rohingya crisis: Myanmar army chief fired</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kasim&quot; is one of these sex traffickers preying on these women. He has agreed to be interviewed but only if we guarantee to hide his identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We pick him up at a pre-arranged meeting point on a dark street outside Kutupalong refugee camp in southern Bangladesh's Ukhia district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He looks like he is in his late twenties, is clean shaven and dressed in jeans and a half sleeve shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">::</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Babies dumped and left to die in Rohingya crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a Rohingya refugee himself and lives inside the camp, but his appearance suggests he was born in Bangladesh and his parents were one of the first wave of refugees who fled Myanmar in the past few decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this latest exodus has been good for his evil trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">:: Why is the Rohingya crisis not classed as genocide?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are more and more people coming and they have lost everything. They don't have money, so more and more girls are coming into the business,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the old refugees are not coming into the business. The new ones are more desperate and have nothing, they are the ones turning to prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who end up alone, maybe who have had family members killed or who are in a very bad condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They come into the business because the aid from the Government doesn't last for a long time. The rice, sugar, oil etc doesn't last for long so they end up with nothing and to earn money they go into prostitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threat is not restricted to women and girls. Kasim says there is also a demand for younger children, both boys and girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies have warned for some time that vulnerable refugees are open to exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police checkpoints are in place around the site to stop Rohingya refugees being taken to nearby cities like Cox's Bazar and Chittagong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">:: The Rohingya crisis explained</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But pimps like Kasim are ruthless people and have found ways of smuggling their victims out of the camps undetected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the chances are fewer than before as there's lots of security forces and check points,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier, anyone could come and go easily but now they have to go through check points. Earlier they could have come easily but now it's a problem for the women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they come they are asked where they are going and they lie about going to the market or Cox's Bazar or to visit relatives, and they cross the check points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once they reach Cox's Bazar they move freely. The girls come for 15 or 30 days and then they go back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They stay here, 10 to 15 girls in one room and there are pimps like me also there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">:: Inside the Rohingya </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">refugee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> camps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we look for these type of girls in the camps. Many women come to me from Kutuapalong or other places, but they are all Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some come here who don't have money or some come here whose husband has been killed or whose husband is in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For women who have two or three children they need money for their children's medicine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traffickers know exactly who to target. From the most desperate, they hunt the most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people who are poor and have four or five girls in the house, maybe they may have got one girl married and couldn't afford to get the other girls married because they need a large dowry.&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These sort of girls come to the business more. The single mothers and also the unmarried girls who are still at home, they are the ones who need the money the most.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasim said the trafficking of girls is not limited to Bangladeshi cities. He claimed to know of Rohingya women who have been sent to India and Pakistan.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya people who have fled Myanmar were labelled a 'serious security threat' by the Indian government as it tried to justify moves to deport up to 40,000 of the refugees&nbsp;on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials claimed in the Supreme Court that there was evidence that there are potentially-dangerous extremists living among the Muslim-faith community that have settled in many Indian cities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home ministry said it would confidentially share intelligence information with the court showing Rohingya links with Pakistan-based militants, in a bid to get clearance for the mass deportation plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a lawyer representing the Rohingya people said the decision to deport the ethnic group was discriminatory, as the court heard a petition filed on behalf of two Rohingya refugees challenging the government plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mukesh Mittal, a senior home ministry official, said the Supreme Court must let the government take a decision in Indian interests because of Rohingya links to extremist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The court has no business to interfere in such matters of what they call illegal immigrants or illegal migrants,' the government said in an affidavit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case is being heard as Bangladesh struggles with more than 410,000 Rohingya who have flooded across the border since August 25 when the military in Buddhist-dominated Myanmar launched a crackdown on the minority Muslim group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries across the region fear they will feel the fallout from the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition was filed after India's junior home minister, Kiren Rijiju, said last month that state governments had been ordered to identify and deport illegal immigrants, including Rohingya Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rijiju said India would even deport all Rohingya refugees, including some 16,500 who have been registered by the UN refugee agency as refugees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Some of the Rohingyas with militant background are also found to be very active in Jammu, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mewat and have been identified as having a very serious and potential threat to the national security of India,' Mittal said in a written submission to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement highlighted the 'serious potential' for an 'eruption of violence against the Buddhists who are Indian citizens who stay on Indian soil'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also said the government had intelligence indicating links between Rohingya refugees and Islamic State and other extremist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya community leaders have denied any link with Islamist extremism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement came in response to a petition filed at the Supreme Court challenging a government decision to deport the Rohingya, many of whom have been in India for the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many experts have questioned where India could send the Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch urged India, the world's biggest democracy, to follow the international principle of non-refoulement which prohibits sending back refugees to a place where their lives are in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'India should not be behaving like the abusive Myanmar government,' said HRW's South Asia director Meenakshi Ganguly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There should be no collective punishment. If there is credible evidence of militancy against individuals, that should be brought before the court,' she told news agency AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations says there are 16,000 registered Rohingya in India, but many more are undocumented. The government puts the figure at 40,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 7,000 of them live in shanties in India's Jammu region in the Himalayas where they say they have faced hostility from the majority Hindu community there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last month it had asked state authorities to identify and deport Rohingya living in their territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says the Rohingya cannot use the 1951 Refugee Convention or the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees since India was not a signatory to either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, representing the Rohingya at the Supreme Court hearing, said the Indian constitution 'provides equal rights and liberty to every person' including non-citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar claims the community are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stateless Rohingya have been fleeing Myanmar for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Bangladesh has been the main destination for Rohingya over the years, some have ended up in India and Nepal. There are also some in Pakistan.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest exodus began after Rohingya militants attacked police posts in Rakhine state on August 25 triggering a military backlash. The UN has said the army action could amount to ethnic cleansing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammad Salimullah, one of the two Rohingya petitioners, said the authorities in New Delhi had always been helpful so he was hopeful the court would support the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In the five or six years that we have been here, we have never felt that we are foreigners here nor have we ever felt any kind of fear,' Salimullah told AFP ahead of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We feel helpless and hopeless,' said Rohingya youth leader Ali Johar, who came to India in 2012 and lives with his family in a Delhi settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The world's largest democracy has given us shelter but they should handle this situation more empathetically.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modi's government has been criticised by activists for not speaking out against Myanmar's recent military offensive against Rohingya insurgents, and right-wing groups in India have begun vilifying Rohingya living there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing will continue next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intel agencies claim Rohingyas using Syria-like tactics to get to India </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the security tightened along the India-Myanmar border, intelligence agencies have warned that the Rohingyas may use sea routes to sneak into the country with the help of professional traffickers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Rohingiyas are desperate to sneak into Indian areas such as Bengal. And organised traffickers are likely to use sea routes from Myanmar and Bangladesh to push them into India,' senior intelligence officials told Mail Today.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'All security agencies concerned have to remain guarded against any such attempt.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the traffickers involved with the Rohingiyas may use their experience in the Mediterranean where they used large boats and high-speed rafts to send refugees fleeing Syria into Europe in large numbers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These routes were also used by a chunk of Islamic State supporters also, they pointed out.&nbsp;There have been sporadic incidents where some Rohingiya famlies tried to sneak into Indian territory using the sea route but such attempts have been few and at a much smaller scale.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The story could be different this time, and much organised,' the intelligence official said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies are also keeping an eye on the movement from the southern part of Myanmar from where the Rohingiyas may try to enter the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and occupy the various uninhabited islands there.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the Border Security Force and Assam Rifles have increased their vigil on the border with Myanmar to prevent the influx of the Rohingiyas and most of them are diverted to Bangladesh, which has also imposed harsh restrictions on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intelligence sources also said that the traffickers and Rohingiyas are keen to reach the state of Bengal as the government is more sympathetic to the displaced and has already announced that it would provide shelter to the refugees from Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Centre has raised a red flag on the security threat from Rohingiyas and the government is developing a mechanism to deport around 40,000 Rohingyas allegedly living in the country illegally.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju stated the government's resolve in this regard more than once.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials point out that after the war broke out in Syria and Iraq, more than two million refugees sneaked into Europe with most of them packed up in boats provided to them by human traffickers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the refugees touched shores in Europe, they spread out across the continent with the help of human traffickers, officials said. They also attributed the influx to an increase in terrorist incident on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports suggest that outfits like Al Qaeda, ISIS and Jamaat-ud Dawa (a front of the Lashkar-e&nbsp; Taiba) of Hafiz Saeed sent their workers to Rohingya camps in Indonesia, Bangladesh and, possibly, India.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These groups entered Rohingya camps on the pretext of providing humanitarian help, but their intention, intelligence agencies suspect, is to identify gullible youths and recruit them as jihadi operators for their outfits.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Myanmar, Rohingiyas have their terrorists groups such as the Aqa Mul Mujahideen (AMM), which is believed to be an offshoot of the Harkat-ul Jihad Islami- Arakan (HuJI-A) and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India has also extended humanitarian assistance for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh by flying down food and other essential items to the neighbour to help it deal with the huge influx of Rohingiyas.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India has also dispatched relief material to Bangaldesh be delivered in multiple consignments under 'Operation Insaniyat' using its C-17 heavy lift aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Italians have marched through Rome in support of the rights of refugees after clashes between migrants and police exposed rising hostility towards recent arrivals in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy is bearing the brunt of the European migration crisis, having seen almost 100,000 people arrive between January and June. Authorities are struggling to cope and efforts to promote integration have become strained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, is due to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and counterparts from Spain and Germany, as well as leaders from Chad, Niger and Libya, on Monday for talks aimed at cutting illegal migration from Africa to Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing influx is deeply dividing Italy's ruling centre-left Democratic party, while rightwing parties have seized on the issue as Italy prepares for a general election expected to be held before May 2018. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In scenes that were widely condemned last week, police armed with batons fired water cannon at a group of around 100 refugees, mostly from Eritrea, who for several days had been camped out in a square in protest against their forced eviction from a nearby office building where they had been squatting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some refugees hurled bottles, rocks and gas canisters as officers tried to clear the camp from the square near Rome's central Termini station. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, these things happen ahead of elections,&quot; C&eacute;cile Kyenge, an MEP and Italy's former integration minister, told the Guardian. &quot;In my opinion, good migrant reception needs to be a priority [in the campaign] - if reception and integration are done well, it would prevent conflicts like the one in Rome and benefit everyone. There are many examples of good integration in Italy, mostly in small towns, but there are also many examples of bad practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees, many of whom had been granted asylum and who have jobs in Rome and children enrolled in schools there, were among a community of 800 who had been squatting in the six-storey building for five years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities said they were evicted after refusing to accept alternative accommodation, and justified clearing the camp by pointing to the risks posed by the gas canisters the squatters had been using for stoves, in an area surrounded by residential buildings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights advocates and the UN refugee agency protested that the eviction had been conducted without warning. Many asylum seekers sleep on the streets of Rome for lack of housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, thousands of asylum seekers, other migrants and supporters marched through the Italian capital carrying banners saying &quot;refugees not terrorists&quot; ,  calling for evictions to be halted and for refugees to be properly housed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As images of last week's clashes spread across the world, Rome's city council, which is led by the populist Five Star Movement, relented on Friday and allowed a group of 40 elderly, sick and young refugees to return to the building for six months after brokering a deal with SEA, the company that owns the block. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interior ministry is now reportedly drafting new guidelines stipulating that any future evictions must include relocation proposals for the most vulnerable. But the incident has highlighted the fact that 200,000 people are currently housed in state-run shelters as they await asylum applications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disillusioned by their government's inability to manage the situation, some Italians are also beginning to revolt. &quot;If you look at the comments on news sites or on Facebook in response to what happened in Rome, you see that people are very passionate about migration and were mostly in favour of the police,&quot; said Giovanni Orsina, a professor of political science at Rome's Luiss University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the numbers of people arriving in Italy by sea fell in July - stymied by a crackdown on NGO search and rescue ships operating off the coast of Libya in the Mediterranean - around 140,000 migrants are projected to reach the country by the end of the year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what was seen as a final political litmus test ahead of next year's general elections, centre-right parties scored victories in local elections in June. The centre-right triumphed in mayoral votes in 15 of the largest cities, including Verona, Monza, Piacenza and the border town of Como, where migrants prevented from entering Switzerland have been sleeping rough in parks and outside the train station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week in the Tuscan town of Pistoia, which in June elected its first rightwing mayor since the second world war, a priest sparked controversy merely by taking a group of migrants to a local swimming pool. Members of the far-right Forza Nuova party said on Friday that they would &quot;control&quot; this week's Sunday mass in retaliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest surprise of the June elections was in Lampedusa, the Sicilian island that has been at the centre of the migration crisis. The Unesco peace prize-winning former mayor Giusi Nicolini resoundingly lost to Salvatore Martello, a hotel owner who ran independently from Italy's main parties and who said he &quot;cannot stand seeing migrants swarming everywhere&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniela DeBono, a research fellow and senior lecturer at the European University Institute and Malm&ouml; University, said Italians were mostly frustrated at &quot;the outcome of the gross mismanagement of the secondary reception system&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Asylum processes can take up to three years, integration programmes are poor and then, of course, migrants are frustrated and are not allowed to be autonomous ...that is quite rightly bothering Italians, especially bearing in mind the high rates of unemployment and precariousness at work,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orsina said: &quot;People can't stand this situation any longer, they don't perceive it as something that is being well-governed. It's beyond racism and fear - Italians might even allow half a million more migrants in, but they want to be able to decide rather than have it imposed on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE of Oxfam's most experienced water engineers, Zulfiquar Ali Haider, was recently approached by a man in his 60s who was living in the Rohingya camps in Bangladesh. Extraordinarily, the refugee recognized Haider as the man who helped to save his life by providing emergency water two decades earlier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reunion was tinged with sadness. For the third time in 40 years, the world watches Rohingya people fleeing after being attacked and driven from their homes. Aid workers like Haider are deployed yet again. The international community watches, again, having collectively failed to find a lasting solution to the decades-long oppression of Rohingya in their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 620,000 refugees have arrived in Bangladesh in the last few months. It's the fastest-growing refugee emergency in the world today.Conditions in the overcrowded camps are woefully inadequate and refugees, especially women and children, are at risk of disease and exploitation. Water is contaminated, latrines are overflowing and there are reports of vulnerable people being trafficked and abused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I said to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon when we met recently, the world continues to fail far too many refugees. The Scottish Government's decision to help fund the relief effort was welcome but the international community urgently needs to plug the $280 million gap in funding for emergency food, water and other essentials and to keep people safe. It also needs to work with the Bangladesh government to develop a longer-term plan to support both the refugees and the local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet emergency aid can only be a sticking plaster. To end the suffering of the Rohingya, it is necessary to tackle the ongoing violence and discrimination that have boiled over into this crisis, sending hundreds of thousands fleeing for their lives.There is mounting evidence that crimes against humanity have taken place with impunity, including massacres, systematic rape and burning of Rohingya villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya are the world's largest stateless group of people. Oxfam spoke to refugees in Bangladesh who had fled Myanmar three times since the 1970s. Although conditions in the refugee camps are totally insufficient and many people said they felt unsafe, they were clear they would like to return but only when guaranteed protection and equal rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many women, traumatised by their experiences, said they would prefer suicide to being forcibly returned. &quot;If we are forced to go back we will set ourselves on fire,&quot; said Sanjida Sajjad. I am angry that the international community has failed to find a permanent solution to the plight of the Rohingya. I am ashamed that, in not speaking out loudly enough, we humanitarians have been complicit. International leaders are failing to put the human rights of all, especially the Rohingya, at the heart of their diplomatic efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, a commission led by Kofi Annan urged the government to reform laws that deny full citizenship to the Rohingya. It called for action to address the underlying causes of chronic under-development, poverty and landlessness for all people in Rakhine State. It called for integration, not segregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was backed by Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the democratic leader of Myanmar. It must be implemented. Democracy in Myanmar cannot be achieved with discrimination and gross violations of human rights. Despite everything, the Rohingya refugees repeated a dignified, clear request to us: equal rights for all, as full citizens. Their call must now be answered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pregnant refugees who have fled across the Mediterranean to Greece are at risk of harm to themselves and their babies because they are not routinely given the care they need before, during and after the birth, say doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report from the charitable organisation Doctors of the World calls for pre- and post-natal care for refugee women across the whole of Europe as well as safe delivery, arguing that it is not only humanitarian but also cost-effective. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Europe does not care for the refugee women and their babies, &quot;we will face new problems that cost a lot&quot;, said Dr Nikitas Kanakis, president of Doctors of the World Greece. &quot;A lot of people talk about the cost of medical care in Europe,&quot; he added. &quot;They forget that not giving care has a cost. Antenatal care costs much less than a handicapped child.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their report, drawing on the experiences of 14,000 refugee women who were cared for by a Mother and Child programme put in place by Doctors of the World in Greece, shows that medical care was inadequate or non-existent for 72% of their health problems. Less than 47% of the women had access to any reproductive healthcare before they arrived at one of the project's eight polyclinics or 15 mobile units across Greece. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the beginning we were surprised that the number was so big,&quot; said Kanakis. We realised access to the hospital was not easy: there were no translators[and] the hostels were crowded. Also behind this was the feeling of safety that they have with us. They know us from the camps when they come. They know us from the boats. They know that someone will deal with their problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also have a lot of women staff. It is easier for women from a Muslim country. Also we see the women alone without a husband. They feel safe to talk, because behind the pregnancy always there is a history - a woman in difficulties or violated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the women they see are living in Greek cities in what they call &quot;Afghan hotels&quot;, paying (EURO)1 a night to sleep 10 to a room, he said. &quot;They live in very difficult conditions.&quot; They may not seek help from government health services because they fear arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of them are traumatised by their experiences. &quot;Pregnant women and single mothers describe incidents of sexual violence in Turkish coast by smugglers,&quot; says the report. Some are pregnant as a result. They suffer serious trauma and mental health problems. The charity gives them support and counselling and help if they want to terminate the pregnancy in hospital in Athens, which is difficult because they don't have documents or insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report describes the case of a woman refugee from Syria, who crossed to Greece from Turkey by boat in January last year with two children and eight months pregnant. She gave birth in a refugee camp but two months later was homeless, sleeping on a bench with her children with hundreds of other refugees in Athens' Victoria Square. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The baby suffered from skin allergies and severe allergic asthma while RM[the mother] had neglected gynaecological problems and panic attacks episodes,&quot; says the report. Doctors of the World intervened, got the family the medical care they needed and they have now been reunited with the father, who had been given refugee status in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second woman it calls EA travelled alone from Togo to Greece in the spring of 2016. She was six months pregnant, sharing a room with 12 others in the centre of Athens &quot;in a very bad psychological condition because the pregnancy was unwanted and she was alone without supportive environment&quot;. She was given psychological as well as gynaecological help by the charity, which has secured her independent accommodation and gives medical support to her and the baby girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report talks of the continuing needs of the refugees, male and female, who are still arriving in Greece. Between January and June this year more than 17,000 patients visited some of their mobile and fixed clinics, it says. Approximately 55% were male and 45% were female. A quarter were children. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgian Minister for Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees Sozar Subari has said that the Turkish side gave Georgia guarantees that Demirel School manager Mustafa Emre Cabuk, who was arrested in Georgia at Turkey's request, will be kept in a high-standard prison. He also spoke of the reasons why Georgia denied Cabuk the status of refugee and the procedures to be followed. The following is the text of Rusudan Shelia's interview with Sozar Subari in the Georgian high circulation weekly newspaper Kviris Palitra on 24 July headlined &quot;'The Turkish side gives us a 100-per-cent guarantee that Cabuk will be kept in a modern-standard prison'&quot;; subheadings inserted editorially:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of the Turkish side, [Turkish national] Mustafa Emre Cabuk, who was arrested in Georgia on 24 May, and his family were not granted the status of refugees. At present, he is held in pre-extradition custody, waiting for the decision. Will the authorities hand the manager of Demirel School [in Tbilisi] over to the Turkish side, while representatives of NGOs and members of the European Parliament urge them to defend his rights? Minister for Internally Displaced Persons [from the Occupied Territories], Accommodation [and Refugees], Sozar Subari, spoke with Kvirit Palitra:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denial of status of refugee not equal to extradition</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Subari] The Mustafa Cabuk case will most probably be considered in the court. This is a purely legal procedure, which has nothing to do with politics. It is clear that the defence has the right to make advantageous statements, including those on political factors. However, I do not understand why so-called third forces are trying to put pressure on the ministry?! This is not going to happen! There is all the more reason for this, as the status of refugee is not connected to extradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Shelia] The status of refugee would halt the process of extradition. Apart from this, according to assessments by members of the European Parliament, what you call pressure is observance of the supremacy of law. They say that in this regard, Turkish nationals are experiencing problems in Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Subari] It is clear that the status of refugee would halt extradition. However, denying him the status does not imply immediate extradition. The decision has to be made by other agencies - the Justice Ministry and the Prosecutor's Office. Before giving the status of refugee to anyone, one has to determine whether the person meets the requirements established by the UN Refugee Convention, for example, whether he/she is subject to political, religious and racial persecution. If no such facts are established, the person will not be granted the status of refugee. Materials needed for extradition are a different matter. To seek Cabuk's extradition, there should be evidence, which would be sufficient to impute guilt on him... After he was denied the status, the issue will be considered by the court. After the [court] consideration is completed, the [process of] extradition will begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk about pressure from Turkey out of question</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Shelia] I am under the impression that the Georgian side is trying to absolve itself of the responsibility, procrastinating the process. Have the authorities reached a deadlock between the pressure being put by the Turkish side and the warnings coming from European parliament members?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Subari] Turkey is our friendly country. Therefore, talk about pressure is out of the question. When one side requests to arrest a person, who has found shelter in another country, there should be cooperation. According to the Turkish side, Mustafa Cabuk is implicated in a crime. It is a fact that a major crime was committed, taking lives of about 300 people, isn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Shelia] It is also a fact that the coup attempt in Turkey was followed by series of arrests of [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan's opponents... How can one determine possible guilt of the manager working in Georgia in the coup, when the materials can be provided by the Turkish side alone and you have no levers to double-check them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Subari] Georgia will study the documents, establishing whether he was involved in the crime in the form of a coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sensitive topics used to play on society's emotions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Shelia] Because of intimidations, Cabuk's family are asking for protection. Do the authorities feel responsibility for them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Subari] According to the family, they received a letter of intimidation in social networks. However, we have no information about who tried to intimidate them or what purpose they have. If it is established that they are facing danger, they will be provided protection. Frankly speaking, if everyone [subject to] intimidation in social networks asks for protection, even special services of a large country will experience problems handling the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Shelia] You do not perceive statements by Cabuk's family seriously, do you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Subari] To make an impact on society and play [on their emotions], sensitive topics are used, including the fact that we also denied Mustafa Cabuk's family the status of refugees. In this case, too, we had an argument - the principle of family integrity. Denying Mustafa Cabuk the status, we could not grant the status to his family. His family members are not prosecuted by the law. They have the right to stay in Georgia or move to another country...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey gives guarantees of Cabuk's safety</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Shelia] The Georgian side bears international responsibility not to extradite even those suspected of crimes, if facts of torture in prisons of other countries are established. What guarantees of Cabuk's safety in Turkish prisons did you receive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Subari] The Turkish side gives us a 100-per-cent guarantee that [Cabuk] will be kept in a modern standard prison and that the Georgian consul will have an opportunity to visit him without restrictions...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Shelia] Turkey's membership in the EU has been postponed indefinitely. According to reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, in [Turkish] prisons, policemen intimidate the arrested by rape, abusing them physically and verbally. Among those arrested for the coup attempt, 23 per cent were raped and 77 per cent were victims of other types of sexual offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Subari] Last year, there arose questions concerning Turkish prisons. However, at the end of 2016, reports by the US Department of State, the UK Home Office and the UN Department against Torture spoke about progress [in the sphere].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Shelia] Is there any statistical data showing the number of those from neighbouring countries, who you granted the status refugees and on what grounds?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Subari] There were 19 applications from Azerbaijan, of which four [applicants] were denied the status, as they were [related to] crimes. They just did not want to serve their sentences in Azerbaijani prisons. One person was given the status. Several people refused to obtain the status, when they learnt that after obtaining the status of refugees, they would not be able to move to other countries, for example, Germany. Other [applications] are still being considered. As regards the applications sent from Turkey, I cannot recall any of them not being related to criminal prosecution. We cannot give the status to people of the kind.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Five sheltersopen already,more than 100 childrenhoused,and over60 jobscreated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-IKEA donation promises five more shelters, increasing capacity to 200 children and over120 jobs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-8,419unaccompanied minors were officially registeredin Greece since the beginning of 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International humanitarian non-profit organization, The HOME Project (http://www.homeproject.org), has received a (EURO)1 million donation from the IKEA Foundation to support its valuable work in housing and employing refugees stranded in Greece through the current crisis. In particular, the HOME Project is working to bring lone refugee children to safety and has already opened five dedicated shelters, putting in place a structure of care and support where none existed before. The HOME Project provides on-the-ground intervention for refugees enduring harsh conditions in camps and at processing points throughout Greece, meeting real human need with specialist support, funding and private-sector partnerships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Photo:http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/565779/The_HOME_Project_IKEA_Foundation.jpg)<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new IKEA Foundation donation will enable The HOME Project to double the scope of its work with the opening of five more shelters, increasing its provision to care for more than 200 children in secure environments that give support, protection, education and social integration services to dozens of displaced children. This latest commitment will bring the total jobs created by The HOME Project to over 120, including employment for many of the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 8,419 of the refugees in Greece are unaccompanied minors, alone or in real danger, having been separated from their parents and at risk of violence, sexual abuse, exploitation and organ trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All children have the right to a safe place to call home,&quot; said Per Heggenes, CEO of the IKEA Foundation. &quot;The IKEA Foundation is supporting the HOME Project because we believe the private sector should work alongside governments and the UN to secure this right for vulnerable migrant children, helping them survive, recover and build a future for themselves.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sofia Kouvelaki, Director of the HOME Project, commented: &quot;The scale of this disaster is epic and children are the true victims of it. We are immensely grateful to the IKEA Foundation for recognising the HOME Project's mission which is critical, and for this generous donation which will make a deep and lasting impact on so many lives. This vital work saves lives and needs support - we hope it will serve as an inspiration to the international community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HOME Project is actively seeking donations and support to help combat this refugee crisis which is the largest humanitarian disaster since the Second World War. More than 1 million refugees have arrived in Greece since the start of 2015 and are in desperate need of aid and shelter, the majority coming from three countries: Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Targeted intervention in camps covers a number of basic needs from milk for babies through to medical, educational, legal and language support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All donations to the HOME Project's work goes directly to refugees helping them to be safe, fed, clothed, sheltered, and integrated into society. The HOME Project continues to seek and enlist all forms of donation, assistance and giving-in-kind to benefit the cause and have a direct impact on the lives of refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HOME Project&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing for 'Help, Overcome, Motivate and Empower', the HOME Project's mission is threefold. First, to bring unaccompanied minors to safety in dedicated shelters where they will be clothed, fed and supported. Second, to source, refurbish and convert unused buildings throughout Greece into shelters, bringing them back to life and into good use. Third, through the conversion, refurbishment and ongoing operation of these shelters it is creating employment, including for refugees - 60 new jobs were created in the first twelve weeks alone. The HOME Project now has another five shelters underway to house 200 children in total and creating over 120 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The founding sponsor of the HOME Project is the Libra Group, a privately owned international business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR today honoured Zannah Mustapha with the 2017 Nansen Refugee Award at a ceremony in Geneva for founding a school in Maiduguri, Nigeria, the epicentre of the Boko Haram insurgency.<BR><BR>The school has stayed open throughout the conflict with Boko Haram, which has seen some 20,000 killed across the Lake Chad region, and millions more displaced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school provides a free education, as well as free meals, uniforms and health care, to children affected and displaced by violence.Those orphaned by the conflict on both sides are welcomed into Mustapha's classrooms as a sign of the reconciliation he hopes to achieve in the region.<BR><BR>UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, presented the Nansen medal to the Mr Mustapha and paid tribute to him in an address:<BR><BR>&quot;Tonight we recognize, we celebrate the achievements of Zannah Mustapha, a man of courage and peace.&quot; said the UN refugee chief.<BR><BR>&quot;He had the courage to build a school. He had the courage to offer education to children affected by violence. I cannot think of any better choice for this year's Nansen Award.&quot;<BR><BR>In the decade since its inception, Mustapha's school has swelled from 36 students to 540. Desperate for an education, thousands more children have added their names to its waiting list. In 2016, Mustapha opened a second school just a few kilometres away from the first.<BR><BR>UNHCR Special Envoy Angelina Jolie also provided a video message of congratulation for Mr. Mustapha. In her address she praised his work and its legacy.<BR><BR>&quot;The courage it takes to defend children's' rights to education in the face of Boko Haram is extraordinary&quot;, she said. &quot;Zannah Mustapha has brought light to a region that has been terrorised for years.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Mr Mustapha, you are an inspiration. I hope this award encourages you and others to continue this vital work.&quot;<BR><BR>In his speech Zannah Mustapha thanked all of the teachers and widows he has worked with and praised the students at his schools, &quot;I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would see these children progressing in such a traumatic period in their lives&quot;, he said. &quot;When I look at the children's faces I see resilience and stability.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;We are not in a journey to be the same but we are in a journey to understand our differences and overcome our adversity. That we can achieve with education&quot;, he continued.<BR><BR>&quot;There are so many children in conflict zones not able to go to school. We have shown what is possible.&quot;<BR><BR>Mustapha's work in the region also includes negotiating the release of Boko Haram hostages. When the 21 young women who had been held captive for more than two years were released, Mustapha was there. He had been instrumental in securing their freedom -- as well as the release of 82 additional Chibok girls in May 2017.<BR><BR>For more than 60 years, UNHCR's Nansen Refugee Award has recognised those who have shown outstanding dedication to the refugee cause. The 2017 winner was honoured with a ceremony that featured renowned Afrobeat musician Tony Allen, an acoustic set by Japanese artist Miyavi and a classical violin piece from renowned soloist Mariela Shaker. The host for the evening was Anita Rani and the keynote address was given by Syrian refugee Nujeen Mustafa.<BR><BR>The Nansen Refugee Award alumnae include the famous as well as unsung heroes; Eleanor Roosevelt, Gra&ccedil;a Machel andLuciano Pavarotti among its laureates, but a number of remarkable unsung heroes, such as Mr.Mustapha, who have dedicated themselves to fighting the injustices suffered by the forcibly displaced: unhcr.org/Nansen.<BR><BR>Distributed by APO on behalf of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors to a large number refugees has damaged her political career and hurt her standing with the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community widely praised her decision in 2015 but her party, the Christian Democrats, saw its poll numbers plummet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her U-turn has drawn back-handed praise from one MEP.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, along with a concrete long-term investment strategy for Africa to eradicate the grass root causes of migration, we reiterate our call to the European leaders to finally set up legal corridors to Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel has addressed the refugee crisis just a month out from the federal elections because the issue is important to Germans who fear more migrants could travel to their country.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">537  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the outside, they look like ordinary cardboard boxes which have been packed with aid to send to Syrians fleeing civil war who are living in refugee camps in the Middle East.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latest shipment of boxes sent from an Edinburgh charity to people living in camps on the Lebanon-Syrian border have a dual purpose - they can be converted into furniture which can be used by the refugees as stools, storage or even school desks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation from Edinburgh Direct Aid (EDA), which is based in the north of the city, will be sent in specially designed boxes which can be cut, folded and made into stackable chests, stools or desks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1,000 boxes of aid containing warm clothes and other essentials will be sent in a ten tonne shipping container from the charity's Granton warehouse to Syrian refugees in Arsal in Lebanon, on the border with Syria, where the temperatures have dropped to 4C overnight in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDA said the desks would be used by schools in the camps, which are often informal and set up by volunteers, while the stools will be utilised in the spring when the weather is warmer and people can sit outside their tents. Refugees are also likely to convert the boxes into storage chests for the few belongings they have with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denis Rutovitz, chairman of EDA, said: &quot;This is the first time that we have had anything like this. We are expecting the people living in the tents to find them very useful indeed - they will be pleased to have somewhere to store their things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The boxes can be made into stackable cupboards, while another way of using the boxes is to put several together and fold them in a way that you can use them as a school desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Generally, the schools in the camps are not very well resourced and there is a shortage of things like desks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The designs were made by packaging company Smurfit Kappa, experts in &quot;second use&quot; of packaging products, which has donated around 10,000 boxes to EDA for use in this and future shipments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Smurfit Kappa said: &quot;These refugees were forced to flee from their home towns, had terrible experiences and are now living in miserable condition, so we are happy to help in any way we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Syrian refugees have been living in makeshift camps on the Lebanon border since the outbreak of war in their homeland in 2010. Earlier this year, around 10,000 people were sent back to Syria, largely under agreements negotiated by Hezbollah, in the largest repatriation of refugees since the war began. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In total around five million Syrians are believed to have been displaced from their homes into the neighbouring nations of Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, with around 1.5 million of those in Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Human Rights Watch visit to Arsal found widespread lack of legal residency, restrictions on freedom of movement, and fear of seemingly random arrests during army raids. Aid groups estimate that between 70 to 80 per cent of the estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon lack legal status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mountainous town of Arsal, which is now home to around 60,000 Syrians alongside a population of 38,000 Lebanese, is higher and therefore often colder than other places in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EDA aid shipment is due to leave Edinburgh today. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Laura Paterson, Press Association Scotland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of a UK aid charity has said the Rohingya people are victims of ``crimes against humanity''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslim minority refugees fleeing violence in their home state of Rakhine in Burma describe soldiers and Buddhist leaders carrying out a systematic campaign of murder and burning villages, accusations which military leaders have denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alistair Dutton, director of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (Sciaf) which has raised more than &pound;160,000 to help the refugees, said: ``I don't know who's guilty of what but what has happened are crimes against humanity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The chopping people up, shooting them, burning bodies, torching villages, stealing belongings and driving people out their country - these are crimes against humanity whoever perpetrated them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on a visit to the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, Mr Dutton said: ``There are an overwhelming number of reports. Everyone spoken to has seen or knew of someone who had family killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I think if these reports were verified they would quite clearly be crimes against humanity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a recent agreement by the Bangladesh and Burmese government for repatriation, refugees continue to arrive, joining some 646,000 who have braved the dangerous border crossing since the surge in violence after Rohingya militants reportedly attacked border posts in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Dutton warned the crisis could last for years, stressing that Sciaf and charity partner Caritas Bangladesh were planning for the long term as the average length of time a person spends as a refugee is 17 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: ``We're here to help the Rohingya. No one should be under any illusion that the recent Memorandum of Understanding between Myanmar and Bangladesh signals the end of this massive humanitarian disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The exile of the Rohingya refugees will almost certainly last for years and we will be here for as long as it takes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early December around 30 refugees were arriving daily by boat from Burma to Shabrang Harbour at the Bangladesh border before being taken to the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One mother who made the crossing earlier this month said she saw children burned to death by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Razia Begum, 30, said: ``I saw some little children who were killed by being burned by fire. I felt very horrible because I did not know how I could protect my children and so I left for another place.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she had no food, money or way to survive in Bangladesh without help and aid donations but said she added ``here I have shelter and I have peace''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another new arrival, seven-year-old Noor Karima, saw her mother and father killed in front of her and escaped to cross the border with her aunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samara Besam, 25, who travelled with her three-year-old son, spent a month in hiding near the Burma border before the day-long crossing to arrive at Shabrang and said she would not return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: ``The military and Buddhist leaders tortured us. Why would we go back to Myanmar when there is no peace?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``They killed us and burned our houses. Why would we go back when there is no shelter?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senowara Begum, 18, now living at the Kutupalong camp, said Buddhists and the military burnt their homes, killed the young men and tortured women and girls but said she would return if the Bangladesh government ``can ensure the peace''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: ``I want to have peace in Myanmar so we can go back. The Myanmar government has to give the Rohingya rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``They have to give us compensation - to return our cows, goats and chickens and give us back our livelihood.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another resident of the camp, Muhamed Ali, told of his father sacrificing himself to save his family and being ``chopped into pieces'' by soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 28-year-old said he would prefer to die in Bangladesh than be sent back to his homeland without the creation of Rohingya state with rights and citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: ``The whole world should pressure Myanmar to agree these terms. If this doesn't happen we will go anywhere where we can find peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``If the Bangladesh government sends us back without any proper settlement, I would say that they should just kill us right here. We would be happier to die here than back in Myanmar.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S a big ugly world out there. and our ability to navigate it successfully can be determined to a large extent by our childhood experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the lucky ones, those formative experiences were generally happy and will have enabled youngsters to thrive into well-functioning adults. Unfortunately, less fortunate people are haunted by their childhood memories, traumatised by them throughout adulthood. I am Bosnian - and I know too many of the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having just finished translating a book written to help child refugees of war deal with their trauma, I was struck by an article I read about a mystery illness that has affected the children of asylum seekers in Sweden. I was interested to learn that over the last two years there have been reports of hundreds of cases of perfectly healthy children suddenly withdrawing completely, ceasing to walk or talk, or even open their eyes. They're not always new arrivals, either. In many cases those affected have lived in Sweden for years, have learned the language and have apparently adjusted well to their new, Nordic-lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say this Resignation Syndrome is a way for these children to protect themselves from what they've experienced. And yet it seems these migrant children have become political pawns in Sweden, much as immigrants are in many other countries around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether you're here in Scotland or in Sweden, the derogatory accusations hurled at asylum seekers and refugees are very similar. They are often said to be trying it on, lying about their age; they're stretching our schools to breaking point; they're pushing crime rates up. This to me is fake news, and the intention of these headlines appears to be to cast suspicion on these children and their families, only adding further to the agony they are trying to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question so rarely asked, however, is why 50 million children across the world are still forced to flee their homes in this, the 21st century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Refugee Council, world events often correlate directly with asylum applications; last year people were most likely to seek refuge here from the Middle East, desperate to escape on-going conflict and the murderous advance of Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, while the pictures we may see on TV perhaps make us think that most refugees are coming to Europe, it simply isn't true. The UN's Refugee Agency estimates that nearly 90 per cent of the world's refugees are sheltered by developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But go back and think about your own childhood experiences. While they certainly play a part in building our resilience in adult life, they can't protect us from losing everything in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Always remember that many asylum seekers and refugees who come to our shores once thought of themselves as the lucky ones. My parents, who are very much in the &quot;happy childhood&quot; category, certainly never thought they'd be forced to leave our home, their successful careers, family and friends, to leave that all behind at a moment's notice. When we left Bosnia in the 1990s, first my mother and my sisters and I escaped on a bus, and only much later was my father able to leave the country. Most of all, they never imagined in the years before that time that their three children would experience the trauma of war at home and then the stigma of being refugees abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given my experience of fleeing a war-torn country, where would you imagine I'd rate my childhood on the ever-so crude scale? Well, despite everything, I undoubtedly class myself as one of the lucky ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also know not to take any of it for granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">596 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his first visit to Uganda in his new role, the Minister emphasised the UK's strong relationship with Uganda and continued partnership in tackling serious challenges in the region. This united approach saves lives and builds prosperity in Uganda, while helping to combat insecurity in neighbouring South Sudan, supporting huge numbers of refugees to rebuild their lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister met people living in Impevi refugee centre, which hosts over 120,000 refugees, where he saw how UK aid is providing vital food, water and shelter to those in need. Increasing violence in South Sudan has forced millions of people to flee their homes to escape starvation and unimaginable horrors, with over 2,000 seeking refuge in neighbouring Uganda every day.<BR><BR>The Minister met with President Museveni to discuss bilateral trade between the UK and Uganda and strengthening the Commonwealth. They also discussed the ongoing crisis in South Sudan and the IGAD led peace process, Uganda's continuing work in Somalia and their support for family planning.<BR><BR>Minister for Africa Rory Stewart said:<BR><BR>&quot;I am delighted to be visiting Uganda and to meet President Museveni. The UK places great value in our relationship with Uganda and I look forward to strengthening this relationship yet further as the new Minister for Africa.<BR><BR>&quot;The importance of Uganda's role in the region cannot be overstated and it is vital to securing a lasting peace in South Sudan. South Sudan faces a worsening humanitarian crisis with over half the population in desperate need and ongoing violence forcing almost four million people to flee their homes and unimaginable horrors, with almost half seeking refuge in neighbouring countries like Uganda.<BR><BR>&quot;The UK stands with Uganda as it manages the fallout of this tragedy. We are committed to both addressing the root causes of forced displacement, but also sustainable support to Uganda in responding to the influx of refugees. Thanks to UK aid, refugees reaching Uganda are receiving shelter, food, medical care, a measure of safety and the hope for a future in the region. This is in everyone's interests&quot;.<BR><BR>The UK is supporting Uganda in managing its growing refugee crisis by providing emergency support as well as helping strengthen services in the local host communities through rapidly upgrading infrastructure, hospitals and schools. On a visit to Vurra Cope Primary School in Rhino Refugee Settlement, where over 2000 of the 3000 students are South Sudanese refugees, the Minister saw how UK support is enabling these children to get back into education and give them hope for the future.<BR><BR>Minister Stewart also met beneficiaries of a UK supported family planning programme in Uganda, which is helping to provide integrated family planning and sexual reproductive health services to vulnerable young people in the area. This was in the same week as the landmark London Family Planning Summit at which the UK increased life-saving assistance to ensure women across the globe have access to modern contraception. The UK recently announced an increase in family planning support to Uganda which will help 380,000 additional women to get access to modern family planning methods, enabling them to finish their education, get better jobs and provide for their smaller, planned families to escape the cycle of poverty.<BR><BR>In the last year, UK aid in Uganda has fed 650,000 people, vaccinated 235,000 children, provided healthcare for 65,000, sheltered 181,000, provided clean water for 40,000 and essential relief items for 64,000 people.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lone child refugees who were brought to Britain after parliament passed an amendment to bring them directly from camps in Europe have described how they are rebuilding their lives in the UK, in an event in Westminster to thank MPs and peers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'It is a disgrace to Europe': former child refugee Lord Dubs on the Calais camp</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 20 teenage refugees from countries including Syria, Iraq, Eritrea and Sudan were hosted by the bishop of Salisbury in parliament on Tuesday. Many described how they had begun to learn English and restart their education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They presented a plaque to Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who campaigned for the amendment last year that prompted the government to commit to bringing lone children from camps in Europe to the UK. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ishmael, 18, from Syria, said he was living with a north London foster family and had started university. &quot;We wanted to come to say thank you to the British parliament and everyone. We have a new life - we lost our country and we lost everything. The British government gave us a home when no one else would,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's our duty now, in our new country, to be part of the British community and help build it together. I believe my country is Britain now. Nothing in the world can change that. The country who kills their own sons is not a country. This country welcomes and takes in the others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Dubs scheme refugee children left on hold for a year in Greece</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Dubs, who came to the UK as a child on the Kindertransport, said he hoped the plaque would be placed next to one in the Palace of Westminster's central lobby, which was laid to honour parliament's decision in 1938 to rescue children from Nazi Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new plaque reads: &quot;We thank the British people and parliament for giving us peace. We found a beautiful life in the UK, so different to the life we fled. We were suffering, but now we are safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though many of the teenagers said they were looking forward to building lives in the UK, others said they faced an uncertain future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhad, an 18-year-old Afghan refugee, said he had been told he would be returned to Kabul. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I left my country because when I was 15 I had two choices, either join Daesh [Islamic State] or the Taliban, or leave,&quot; he said. &quot;My mother and I decided I had to leave. I didn't want to go and fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhad spent almost a year on the move from his home country across Europe, eventually spending six months in the Calais refugee camp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a really, really bad situation and very dangerous. In my country, we don't have anything,&quot; he said, pausing several times during his speech to MPs because he was overwhelmed with emotion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Calais it was the winter. We had no blankets, nothing to eat, trying every night to get in lorries and get to this country. Now I have two years here, but then I have to return to Kabul. They say it is safe, but it's a war zone. I don't know what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others said they hoped to be reunited with family who were still in camps in Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tekle, from Eritrea, asked MPs to help bring his 14-year-old brother, who he said was still sleeping rough in Calais. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to say thank you for helping us. My brother is still in Calais and I really want to ask for the opportunity to bring him here, to have the opportunity I had. I was struggling here, but I have had help provided for me, I was able to integrate, learn English. I want him to have the same opportunity as me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beth Gardiner-Smith, a senior campaigns organiser for Safe Passage, a refugee rights organisation, said the charity feared there was &quot;no longer a sense of urgency about what is still a crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Calais camp was demolished last year, many refugees are still sleeping rough in the woods and about 280 local authority places offered for refugee children remained unfilled, Gardiner-Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're talking about vulnerable young people who are scared and losing faith in a system that is legal and instead risking their lives attempting dangerous routes,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josie Naughton, the founder of Help Refugees, which is assisting lone children sleeping rough near the French port, said many were at the mercy of traffickers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are here today to demand that, at the very least, all 480 places are filled before the end of the year, to protect at least some of the children of Calais from freezing temperatures this Christmas,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Afghan refugee ice addict accused of 'deliberately' ploughing through a crowd of shoppers in Melbourne 's city centre has blamed the horrific attack on Australia's 'poor treatment of Muslims'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as horrific CCTV footage, obtained by 7 News, captured the exact moment a white Suzuki SUV pulled away from traffic and ploughed into unsuspecting pedestrians outside busy Flinders Street Station on Thursday afternoon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shocked bystanders were pointing in disbelief on the street as dozens of people - including a four-year-old boy and an 83-year-old man - were mowed down by the rampaging driver as he hurtled down the tram tracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saeed Noori, the driver behind the wheel of the SUV with P-plates, arrived in Australia as a refugee in 2004 through a resettlement program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He came to Australia as a refugee. He did not come with a people smuggler, he came through the appropriate refugee, the normal refugee programs,' Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking briefly to investigators last night as he lay in a hospital bed at St Vincent's under police guard, the 32-year-old made a 'number of utterances' and 'spoke about dreams and voices'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But he also did attribute some of his actions to the poor treatment of Muslims,' Acting Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said on Friday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Patton said Noori had a history of drug use and mental illness, stressing that investigators had not yet found any extremist or terrorist links to the horror rampage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At this stage, because investigations are continuing, apart from that statement, there are no known links to any political issues or any, certainly any links to extremist groups,' Mr Turnbull said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Therefore, the position I am advised off at the moment is that no terrorism link has been identified at this stage. I want to stress, there is a mass of material that is being investigated and nothing should be ruled out, nothing should be ruled out.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Now, whatever the motivation, this was a despicable and cowardly act, but I want to reassure all Australians that this is an isolated incident.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The injured off-duty police officer who arrested Noori was hailed a hero after footage revealed him wrestling the Afghan immigrant to the ground moments after he crashed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the gallant officer recovered in hospital from a shoulder injury,&nbsp;Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews praised the hero for rushing into the SUV just 15 seconds after it crashed into a bollard - which he described as 'an act of evil'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The off-duty arresting officer, a member of Victoria police, who was prime in terms of detaining the alleged offender did suffer some injuries and is receiving hospital treatment,' he told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We would be right to single him out for special praise for the way in which he instinctively came to the aid of others in the protection of public order and potentially avoiding so much other carnage.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 4.41pm carnage on the corner of&nbsp;Flinders and Elizabeth streets injured 19 people, five critically - less than a year after six people, including a three-month-old boy, were killed in an eerily similar rampage on nearby Bourke Street just four blocks away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest injury toll included a four-year-old boy with head injuries, who remains in a stable condition and improved overnight, and an 83-year-old man, with the other wounded bystanders aged between 25 and 58.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lone wolf driver was an Australian citizen from Afghanistan, who was known to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noori was released from hospital on Friday afternoon and taken to Melbourne Police Station where detectives hope to formally interview him and potentially lay charges after that.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Patton said the driver had&nbsp;a 'history of drug use as well as mental health issues'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We understand that he is on a mental health plan and receiving treatment for a mental illness,' he said. 'We're working to clarify that.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the driver had missed a medical appointment on the day of the 'deliberate attack'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's horrendous and life-changing for all emergency services who attend,' he added, praising the work of officers who arrived on the scene within 15 seconds of the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's life changing for victims and for those present. Their lives will be changed forever.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 24-year-old man wearing a Nike shirt, who was carrying a bag containing three knives, was arrested on the steps at Flinders Street station but police say he had no link to the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Clarity on the second offender that is in custody, it has not yet been determined whether he was involved, and it is quite probable he was not,' Acting Commissioner Shane Patton told reporters.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was released on Friday morning and is expected to be charged with&nbsp;possession of cannabis and a prohibited weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crash injured 19 people, including the driver and the heroic off-duty police officer.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five men, aged 25, 40, 43, 45 and 83 and six women, aged 25, 30, 35, 47 and 58, were among the victims.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another three men and two women were injured but their ages are unknown.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria Police believe the incident had no terror link with no political motive so far established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We do not have any evidence to a connection with terrorism,' Acting Commissioner Patton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At this stage we believe it is a deliberate act, however we do not know the motivation.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria's Labor Premier Daniel Andrews said the rampage was an 'horrific act' which targeted 'innocent bystanders'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What occurred on Flinders Street this afternoon was an act of evil and an act of cowardice,' he said on Thursday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;'This is a terrible, evil, cowardly act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At a time of the year when so many families are celebrating the end of they year, doing their Christmas shopping... we have seen a horrific act.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footage shows one of the men in a white shirt with a beard being pulled to the gutter away from the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another man, who was wearing a red checked shirt with a beard, was previously reported to have been arrested but is believed to have been an innocent bystander who was simply in the company of a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness described seeing the car hurtling towards the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It just mowed everybody down, people were flying everywhere,' she told Melbourne radio station 3AW.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We heard thump, thump. People are running everywhere.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dramatic footage shows a number of injured pedestrians being treated by passers-by as they wait for paramedics.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vince Harris, the manager of the Freechoice tobacconist at Flinders Street Station, was nearby in the immediate aftermath of the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was on the scene from about two minutes after the car collided and could see the cracked windscreen and Good Samaritans trying to save injured pedestrians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A few ladies were screaming but it was calm - there were no sirens, nothing,' Mr Harris said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I was here when the other one (the Bourke Street tragedy) happened .... you get desensitised.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irish demolition worker Paul Cahalane, 25, was walking to the gym - and en route to picking up some chocolate milk - via Flinders Street when he heard what sounded like a bomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I was just going to get chocolate milk and I had my headphones in, music playing, scrolling Instagram when I just heard a bang, a bang behind me,' Mr Cahalane told Daily Mail Australia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness&nbsp;&nbsp;Lachlan Vella told Fairfax Media &nbsp;he saw a man dressed in a suit with his 'head busted open' as he was lying on the ground.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Vella said another man 'had blood around his head and was snoring, like atonal breathing,' as a woman came in and out of consciousness.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One witness's husband told Daily Mail Australia his wife had been taken to Melbourne West with other onlookers to be interviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have locked down vast areas of the city taking in Flinders Street, Flinders Lane and Elizabeth Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A child at pre-school suffered head injuries and was taken to the Royal Children's Hospital in a serious condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three people were taken to The Alfred Hospital and three people were taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital but the extent of the injuries are unknown.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses told 9 News they saw the white SUV being driven at about 60km/h before it smashed into dozens of pedestrians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness told 3AW &nbsp;there were about 'five to seven people laying on the ground'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More could have been injured if not for the vehicle crashing into a bollard at the tram stop out the front of Flinders Street Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lachlan Read, 20, told The Herald Sun the whole rampage lasted about 15 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He has gone straight through the red light at pace and it was bang, bang, bang. It was just one after the other,' Mr Read said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There were bodies on the ground and people running up to them - it was mayhem.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A childcare centre and other buildings along Flinders Street were evacuated.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the federal and state security agencies would work together to investigate the 'shocking incident'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the emergency and health workers who are treating them,' Mr Turnbull tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carnage comes almost a year after six people were killed and 30 injured when a car ploughed through the Bourke Street Mall only a few blocks away.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver, Dimitrious Gargasoulas, was charged with six counts of murder after he allegedly used a maroon mid-1990s Holden Commodore sedan to run down shoppers during their summer lunch break.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A child and two adults were amoung those who died following the attack as well as a three-month-old baby boy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis has demanded that the international community take &quot;decisive measures&quot; to resolve the causes of the mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, breaking his recent silence over what the United Nations has declared to be a textbook case of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving in Bangladesh from Myanmar, he said it also was &quot;imperative&quot; for world governments to immediately provide assistance to help the Bangladeshi government cope with Asia's worst refugee crisis in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech in front of Bangladesh president Abdul Hamid, government officials and ambassadors from around the world, Francis praised Bangladesh's sacrifice and generosity in welcoming in so many refugees &quot;before the eyes of the whole world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not identify the Rohingya by name, ethnicity or faith, referring only to &quot;refugees from Rakhine state&quot; but his words were sharp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of us can fail to be aware of the gravity of the situation, the immense toll of human suffering involved, and the precarious living conditions of so many of our brothers and sisters, a majority of whom are women and children, crowded in the refugee camps,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is imperative that the international community take decisive measures to address this grave crisis, not only by working to resolve the political issues that have led to the mass displacement of people, but also by offering immediate material assistance to Bangladesh in its effort to respond effectively to urgent human needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis, a tireless and fearless advocate for refugees, outcasts and society's most marginal, had drawn criticism from human rights organisations and Rohingya themselves for having failed to speak out publicly about their plight while he was in Myanmar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis has demanded that the international community take &quot;decisive measures&quot; to resolve the causes of the mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, breaking his recent silence over what the United Nations has declared to be a textbook case of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving in Bangladesh from Myanmar, he said it also was &quot;imperative&quot; for world governments to immediately provide assistance to help the Bangladeshi government cope with Asia's worst refugee crisis in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech in front of Bangladesh president Abdul Hamid, government officials and ambassadors from around the world, Francis praised Bangladesh's sacrifice and generosity in welcoming in so many refugees &quot;before the eyes of the whole world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not identify the Rohingya by name, ethnicity or faith, referring only to &quot;refugees from Rakhine state&quot; but his words were sharp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of us can fail to be aware of the gravity of the situation, the immense toll of human suffering involved, and the precarious living conditions of so many of our brothers and sisters, a majority of whom are women and children, crowded in the refugee camps,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is imperative that the international community take decisive measures to address this grave crisis, not only by working to resolve the political issues that have led to the mass displacement of people, but also by offering immediate material assistance to Bangladesh in its effort to respond effectively to urgent human needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis, a tireless and fearless advocate for refugees, outcasts and society's most marginal, had drawn criticism from human rights organisations and Rohingya themselves for having failed to speak out publicly about their plight while he was in Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had remained silent out of diplomatic deference to his hosts, who consider the Rohingya as having illegally migrated from Bangladesh and do not recognise them as one of Myanmar's ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 620,000 Rohingya have fled Burma and poured into Bangladesh refugee camps over the last few months amid a scorched earth campaign by the Burmese military.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">David McCann </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pg. 12</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">810 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a dusty wind blows across the arid Jordanian desert 50 miles south of the Syrian border, row upon row of white metal houses in neat lines emerge from the haze. Women dressed in black hijabs, some with niqab veils, carry water from shared taps or shopping from the few stores back to their new homes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Azraq camp houses 35,000 refugees out of about 1.3 million who have fled into Jordan from the brutal six-year civil war that is consuming Syria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Jordan, long a beacon of stability in a troubled region, the refugees pose huge challenges, not least economic. The government estimate the cost of refugees is about eight per cent of the country's GDP with the international community covering less than six per cent of the total spend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large numbers of the refugees have settled in some of Jordan's poorest neighbourhoods in cramped housing with rents tripling since the crisis began. An estimated 140,000 children have enrolled in schools that are already over-crowded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Azraq residents, the support of a camp run by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees provides shelter and basic needs but is no panacea. Three fifths of the residents are children and three in 10 families are headed by women. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each resident gets about &pound;20 per month in electronic tokens to buy food from markets run by residents and local Jordanian people.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But work opportunities are limited to small payments for helping in the camp. Help for refugees in terms of aid and services has increased frustration among the 6.5 million ordinary Jordanian citizens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrian refugees, more than most, follow the twists and turns of the bitter civil war in their homeland. A  staggering total approaching half a million people have been killed out of a population of about 18 million. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragic story that is today's Syria began with the Damascus Spring, a period of hope. Mild-mannered ophthalmologist Bashar Al-Assad with his British-born wife Asma returned from working in a London eye hospital to succeed his father, strongman Hafez Al-Assad who died in 2000. Spring ended swiftly with the arrest of opposition figures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just after the Arab Spring revolt against autocratic rule in North Africa and the Middle East began in Tunisia in 2010, the arrest and torture by the Damascus Baathist regime of a boy for writing graffiti triggered the start of a civil war .The refugee crisis is the largest since the Second World War. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Assad and the Alawite Shia regime tighten their grip over the country, backed by Russia and Iran, the future remains uncertain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's official position is that it is working towards a democratic Syria and lasting stability for all Syrians. How that can ever be achieved is less obvious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems increasingly clear that any hopes of removing Assad or installing a reformed government are delusional. Over the past year, Assad has won a string of military victories in western Syria. Readers interested in a real-time map of regime control may find syria.liveuamap.com/ of interest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia engineered a settlement at a meeting in Astana in Kazakhstan between the regime and several opposition groups based on four de-escalation zones where rebel groups are based. Many analysts believe this is a gift to the Assad regime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The zones are supposed to observe cease-fires but Damascus, with Iranian backing, has continued attacks when expedient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria's professional and business communities and various minority groups within the country are backing the regime, not from any great love of the Damascus rulers but because they fear they would suffer under Islamist rule were elements of the opposition to take control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best that the West can realistically hope for is some minor compromise from Assad, perhaps a new prime minister, but it defies credibility to expect the vicious regime will offer free elections or anything that threatens its rule. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West does not want to support Assad with reconstruction support but there is another way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain, the US and others can help the millions of Syrian refugees now living outside the country in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey by helping hard-pressed host governments and removing as far as possible the opportunities to recruit jihadis among the unemployed, angry young men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the people of Azrag, the future promises little certainty and difficult conditions for refugees who, despite the harsh rule of the regime, may have had secure, comfortable lives in pre-war Syria.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The desert winter sees temperatures outside the metal shelters drop to seven deg C in contrast to summer's 27 or 28 degrees. Stress can lead to domestic violence or psychiatric problems.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the refugees face a dilemma. Stay in camps or eke out a living in urban areas of their host countries or return to a war-devastated Syria and a brutal security state. It is a choice we in the West are fortunate never to have to make. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sydney&nbsp;(Alliance News) - Canberra is &quot;disappointed&quot; that the resettling in the US of hundreds of refugees detained in Australia's offshore migration centres has been delayed due to the US quota having already been filled, a minister said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had got to the end of their 50,000 before they had finished the processing of those people that are under consideration out of Manus and Nauru,&quot; Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said on Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are disappointed that they haven't been able to move this month, which was my hope, but their new programme year starts on October 1 and we are working with both the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that we can get people off as quickly as possible,&quot; he told reporters in&nbsp;Brisbane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the administration of then president Barack&nbsp;Obama agreed to accept up to 1,250 refugees out of hundreds of asylum seekers currently languishing in Australian-run immigration detention camps on the impoverished Pacific islands of Nauru and Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But new US President Donald Trump had reduced the number of refugees the US will accept each year by half, to 50,000, a quota which it reached this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The asylum seekers and refugees, mostly from Iran, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, have been in the Australian-run camps for about four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The living conditions in the camps have been condemned by the United Nations, rights groups and even an Australian parliamentary inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their first ever telephone conversation in&nbsp;January, Trump lambasted at Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over the agreement, which he later called &quot;a dumb deal&quot; in a Twitter post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then US officials have said they will honour the agreement, and Trump has said the refugees would be subjected to &quot;extreme vetting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights activists criticized the delay on&nbsp;Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This delay means the men, women and children trapped in Australia's abusive offshore detention system will continue to suffer in cruel conditions and be exposed to danger,&quot; Ming Yu Hah, Refugee Campaigner at Amnesty International Australia, told dpa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people will have to wait even longer for a chance at rebuilding their lives in a safe place,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lack of transparency of what is to happen to all, not just some of the 2,000 people is deeply distressing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hah said even if the US deal &quot;goes ahead and provides safety for some people, the Australian government's 'solution' won't ensure safety for everyone,&quot; since it is not certain what will happen to those who are rejected, and the US has not said exactly how many they will take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton said on Friday the regional processing centre on Manus, which has men-only camps for some 800 people, will close by the end of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme&nbsp;Court of Papua New Guinea last year said the immigration centres were unconstitutional&nbsp;and asked the government to shut them down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is likely that the asylum seekers in&nbsp;Manus who are rejected by the US will be transferred to Nauru, where they will remain indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty's Hah said the government must bring every refugee and asylum seeker in Nauru and Manus immediately to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the fairest and quickest way to prevent another tragedy. No one can be left behind,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week it was revealed that the government has already spent around AUD5 billion in the immigration camps on two Pacific islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, last month, Australia reached a settlement of 90 million dollars with more than 1,900 asylum seekers who sued over their treatment on Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has implemented a strict policy of sending boats back to where they set off from, as well as not settling any refugees who try to arrive by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hah said both the major parties should &quot;pursue humane alternative refugee policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Policies that both reduce deaths at sea and eliminate abuse: one shouldn't come at the expense of the other and it's about time the Australian Government stops its practice of intentional cruelty,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia must step in to prevent a &quot;looming humanitarian emergency&quot; in Papua New Guinea due to the abrupt close of its immigration processing centre on Manus island, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation said it had profound concerns about the &quot;mounting risk&quot; associated with offshore processing and the &quot;extraordinary human toll&quot; it was taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Drug-testing welfare recipients will stigmatise poor, UN official says</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre is due to close on 31 October, and federal minister Michaelia Cash has said PNG authorities would forcefully deport any non-refugees who refused to return to their home countries willingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cash would not rule out cutting off water and electricity services or using force to move refugees into alternative accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities have tried various means to move all detainees into alternative accommodation as they close the centre section by section, more than four years after it was reopened by the Gillard government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having created the present crisis, to now abandon the same acutely vulnerable human beings would be unconscionable&quot;, said Thomas Albrecht, UNHCR's regional representative in Canberra. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legally and morally, Australia cannot walk away from all those it has forcibly transferred to Papua New Guinea and Nauru.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR called on the Australian government, which it said had obligations to people who sought its protection, to provide long term adequate care to prevent a humanitarian emergency. It was &quot;gravely concerned&quot; sufficient expertise was not being maintained in the handover of service and welfare provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As of today, there is no clear planning for new contracts to even begin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR said its recent missions to the centre in April and September of this year amplified their concerns for the health and wellbeing of asylum seekers and refugees. Two people have taken their own lives in the last two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lack of proper planning for the closure of existing facilities, insufficient consultation with the Papua New Guinean community, and the absence of long-term solutions for those not included in the relocation arrangement to the United States of America, has increased an already critical risk of instability and harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Torture and trauma services have ceased and there is continuing concern over the lack of psychiatric services in PNG. Medical care, historically provided by IHMS within the centre, is also being withdrawn. PNG's health system is reportedly in a state of crisis, with medication shortages across the country, including in Manus province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Louise Newman, spokeswoman for the Asylum Seekers Advocacy Group, said the health and mental health situation was already in crisis, noting reports from detainees that some were being given a month's worth of medication ahead of the closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is heightened tension there at the moment, reports of people whose mental health is deteriorating, and we have had a couple of deaths thought to be suicides,&quot; said Newman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very volatile environment so from a mental health perspective this is a very risky strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the 900 men are expected to be housed in two transit centres in East Lorengau, and non-refugees are expected to return to their countries of origin. Several dozen have been transferred to Port Moresby, in some instances for medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week refugees were offered the chance to move to Nauru and continue their applications for US resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However many have refused to move from the centre, citing fears for their safety living in the PNG community. Some whose claims for protection have been denied have refused to return home, and others have refused to take part in the refugee process at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Refugees have been threatened with arrest, and forced to live in compounds with basic services cut off around them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Wamoi, a Lorengau resident and cofounder of the Manus Alliance Against Human Rights Abuses, said Manusians had concerns about the closure of the centre and the transfer of people into the community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has no idea long-term about the relocation of these people,&quot; said Wamoi. &quot;I've asked the local government... to come down and address the issues about whatever social impact will arise if the asylum seekers are moved there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wamoi said community members were planning protests to advocate for the asylum seekers and refugees and called on the Australian government to assist the asylum seekers and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Australians have forgotten about them, they have abandoned them. The government must be responsible,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Progressive Democrats TD has defended her opposition to the resettlement of 60 Syrian refugees in Longford. Mae Sexton, a PD deputy from 2002 to 2007 and an independent candidate at the last election, argued against accepting 10 Syrian families in the midlands county because it had a high level of welfare dependency and could not provide services to its existing population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she distanced herself from a new Facebook page Longford Against Foreigners which appeared last week congratulating her for her stance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I unreservedly reject and abhor the sentiment [Longford Against Foreigners] personifies, which I find repulsive and detestable and is against everything I stand for,&quot; Sexton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten Syrian families will move from an orientation centre in Monasterevin, Co Kildare, to Longford near the end of the year. They are expected to be housed in towns with second-level schools such as Ballymahon, Granard and Lanesboro, according to sources familiar with the settlement programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sexton said she accepted the Syrian refugees were trying to get away from &quot;horrendous situations&quot; in their wartorn homeland, but rejected the government policy of &quot;imposing&quot; families on towns across the country regardless of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Syrian refugees are not a problem ... everyone of us as mothers and families would accommodate them in our own homes if we were able to,&quot; she told Shannonside radio last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This decision was taken at national level, and rightly so, that we would accommodate 4,000 refugees from Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the [council] executive and councillors have now agreed the government policy of imposing these communities on Longford is OK without examining the economic viability of such a decision in minute detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are counties in this country that have taken no refugees in this form and don't intend to take them. Longford cannot fully service our own community, never mind the new communities that come to live in our midst.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Mulleady, the county council chairman, said the neighbouring counties of Leitrim, Roscommon and Westmeath had each taken a certain number of Syrian families and Longford had to play its part in meeting the national commitment to accept 4,000 refugees. The cost of their move and housing would be co-funded by the EU and the Department of Justice, and would have no effect on anyone's existing position on the Longford housing list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They deserve a chance, they deserve a home, they deserve to live,&quot; said Mulleady. &quot;Whose parents in this country didn't have to leave Ireland and go to England or American to get a job at some point in their lives? &quot;These people will have Irish passports and will have full rights to work here - that is a good thing, they are not just coming into 'the system' and there were councillors at our meeting last week who said their towns would openly welcome them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sexton received less than 3% of the first preference vote in Longford Westmeath in last year's general election and was eliminated without a refund of election expenses. She was elected as a PD candidate in 2002, lost her Dail seat in 2007, and failed to get re-elected in 2011 as a Labour candidate nor in 2016 as an independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For any government department or local authority to decide to place already traumatised and vulnerable communities into an area with a 60% dependency rate, well above the national average, and a deprivation index of an equally stark nature without first taking the state's own statistics into consideration is inexcusable and shameful,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of students from De Montfort University Leicester (DMU) are flying out to New York to help launch a global United Nations initiative to offer worldwide support to refugees.<BR><BR>The university has been asked by the UN to take the lead in engaging the higher education sector worldwide to be part of its Together campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is therefore flying more than 1,000 of its students out to New York to embark on a variety of academic trips and visits around the city, and inviting universities from across the world to a launch event at the UN headquarters on January 9.<BR><BR>The summit will encourage debate on the current challenges for safety and dignity faced by refugees in local communities and universities, led by DMU, will share ideas for practical ways they can use the skills, experience and voluntary power on their campuses to support those in need in their local areas.<BR><BR>A UN Together Action Charter will be created for partner universities to sign at the event.<BR><BR>DMU has been chosen for the work it currently does in its local Leicester community providing support to refugees and people of all abilities and backgrounds across society.<BR><BR>In illustration of this, while out in New York, DMU students are volunteering at the RDJ Refugee Shelter in the heart of New York City to help support homeless refugees and asylum seekers.<BR><BR>They will also help to set up and deliver a children's party for families in need across Harlem and will put together toiletry kits to be given to refugees at the Catholic Charities Community Services in Downtown Manhattan.<BR><BR>DMU Vice-Chancellor Professor Dominic Shellard said: 'The Together campaign fits perfectly with DMU's vision and our belief in the important role of universities as a force for public good.<BR><BR>'DMU defines itself by its diversity and being welcoming and open to all. We are a university which works for the public good and so we are hugely proud and excited to have been asked to lead this campaign.<BR><BR>'We are looking forward to collaborating with universities from across the world to make a real difference to the way refugees are treated.'<BR><BR>The UN Together launch on January 9 forms the culmination of a week-long visit by DMU, which will see more than 1,000 DMU students and staff participate in a packed programme of academic activities which will bring the learning on their courses to colourful life.<BR><BR>A total of 30 different courses have prepared tailored itineraries for the students, giving experiences which will enrich their classroom learning and improve their chances of getting the career they want.<BR><BR>Film Studies students will go to the Museum of the Moving Image to learn about the history of cinema, while Advertising and Branding students will visit Times Square to see how the biggest companies in the world grab the world's eyes.<BR><BR>Forensic Science students will see inside the workings of the New York Supreme Court and Engineering students will get to understand construction on the biggest scale at the Skyscraper Museum and Intrepid Sea Air and Space Museum.<BR><BR>Prof Shellard added: 'DMU has a truly international outlook and this is reflected in the 1,000 students and staff that will be taking part in this #DMUglobal visit to New York.<BR><BR>'The trip will provide students on courses from right across the university a unique opportunity to enhance their academic studies with relevant and meaningful experiences at some of New York's most iconic locations and industries.'<BR><BR>DMU has a proud history of helping less fortunate members of the community. In the last five years, DMU's volunteering programme has grown to deliver more than 120 activities and projects and almost 6,000 students have collectively contributed more than 85,100 hours of their time.<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey's prime minister has warned that the country has the power to allow millions of refugees to resume their journeys to western Europe if the US and EU-backed Kurdish forces fighting in Syria are given a role in peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sixth round of UN sponsored Syrian talks to find a political solution for the six-year conflict is due to resume in Geneva on Tuesday, and Turkish opposition to any role in the talks for the Kurdish forces, the YPG, is likely to prove one of many stumbling blocks. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey regards the Syrian Kurds as inextricably linked to the Kurdish militant organisation, the PKK, operating inside Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  EU-Turkey refugee deal - Q&amp;A</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking after a meeting with Theresa May in London on Monday, Binali Yildirim said it was possible for Turkey to renege on its agreement with the EU, which has seen 3.5 million refugees from neighbouring Syria settle inside Turkey instead of heading for western Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting Turkey is essential to Europe's security, and had prevented more than 53,000 foreign fighters reaching Syria and Iraq, he said: &quot;We know how much [of] a headache the PKK constitute. If there is tolerance vis-a-vis these organisations in the long term, Europe will be endangering its own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yildirim stressed he was not threatening Europe, but was merely reminding the bloc that Turkey has the power to unblock the route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he said Turkey remained committed to joining the EU, he bitterly denounced an agreement signed last year with the bloc intended to deal with the Syrian refugee crisis as a &quot;big, big lie&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused the EU of failing to stick to a bargain struck in March 2016 in which Turkey would be granted visa liberalisation and cash in return for keeping Syrian refugees within its borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We neutralised thousands of Daesh (Isis) fighters and we are currently welcoming 3.5 million refugees in Turkey. What happens if we were tell them: 'Here's Europe, off you go'. Can you imagine what will happen? Of course... it is not something we will do.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yildirim also said he expected the US to show goodwill towards Turkey by terminating its relationship with the YPG, including the provision of arms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  US decision to arm Kurds in Syria poses threat to Turkey, says Ankara</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;We see the YPG as is a terrorist organisation and has no place in the peace process. It will become one of the most sensitive issues for us&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the US, however, the YPG has been vital to the defeat of Isis in Raqqa, and some US state department officials believe a Syria-wide settlement has to include some form of federal power for the Syrian Kurds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yildirim initially said he was sure Turkey's new partners in the Syria peace process -Russia and Iran - shared its view on barring the Kurds from any role, but added later &quot;Iran understands our position better&quot;. Russia, he said, merely respected Turkey's position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yildirim also reaffirmed that Turkey did not believe that the crisis in Syria could be resolved whilst President Bashar al-Assad remained in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current regime is responsible for the way things have evolved in Syria... I don't think it's a realistic prospect to build lasting peace in Syria with Assad (in place),&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria has not yet confirmed that its delegation will attend the Geneva talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yildirim was in London in part to discuss the initial progress on a post-Brexit trade deal, as well as co-operation on the development of a Turkish stealth fighter, the TF-X project. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following his talks with May in Downing Street, Yildirim said the two countries had begun work on a post-Brexit free trade agreement and set up a joint working group which met for the first time earlier this month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that while a deal could not be finalised until the UK had actually withdrawn from the EU, the preparations would take place &quot;in parallel&quot; with the Brexit negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These will take place simultaneously. It is not like we will first wait for the UK to finish Brexit and then see what happens,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;That is not the kind of approach we have in mind. That would be wrong. Work has already started on it and it has to start.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I WAS interviewing ten foster parents in West London for a report on children in care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foster parents are in great demand, so I was startled to discover that only one of the sets of parents was looking after the sort of vulnerable children you imagine to be in the care system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The others were looking after unaccompanied asylum-seeker children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They made an alarming claim: Three of these seemed to be adults passing themselves off as boys. &quot;The first thing they ask for is a razor,&quot; said one foster parent. &quot;Our concerns are just fobbed off,&quot; said another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A counter-extremism expert told &quot;There is nothing in the system to stop a 26-year-old IS fighter coming here, stating he is 17 and claiming asylum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone forced to flee his or her country with a well-founded fear of persecution can claim asylum. An orphan under 18 has special rights. They receive the same benefits as a child taken into care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes help with funding university education and a place up the top of the housing www.list.No one would begrudge a genuine child refugee these privileges. The problem is the system is open to abuse, and the latest terrorist attack in Parsons Green raises further questions. Ahmed Hassan is an 18-year-old unaccompanied asylum seeker who allegedly built the bomb in his foster parents' kitchen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time, surely, to question our asylum system for refugee children. Yet raise concerns and you risk being labelled racist and heartless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is sorting myth from fact. The first myth is that these vulnerable children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is only eight per cent unaccompanied minors who arrived the UK in 2015 were under 14. This according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half were aged 16 to 17. Some 91 per cent were male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save The Children admits that &quot;many come across as being self-reliant and not in need of support&quot;, though &quot;vulnerable and in need of reassurance and care&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another myth is that refugees somehow find their own way to the UK. The truth is none arrive in this country without the help of a people trafficker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means it is the people traffickers who dictate who comes here. Refugees who cannot afford to pay never make if we really want to help the vulnerable, we should be taking children directly from refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one UK airport immigration officer, with 20 years' experience of dealing with refugee children, explained to me: &quot;Ninety per cent of them are not orphans. Their coming here is very well worked out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their families have paid the people ently traffickers to bring them here. The intention is for the families to follow shortly after. These are cash-rich young people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, in his opinion, &quot;they are not fleeing for their lives&quot;. In other words, they are economic migrants and therefore not entitled to asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traffickers themselves instruct them to lie about their nationality and age and destroy all identity documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third myth is that every child refugee is speaking the truth. Actually, we have no way of knowing. The lack documentation means the most basic facts about a young person cannot be checked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration officer explained: &quot;For years we have had adult Pakistani males arriving, maintaining they are Afghan teenagers. They tell me they are 13 or 14 but they are clearly over 20, well developed and with good facial hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015 the second-largest number of claimants came from Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-operation between traffickers and extremists is an alarming threat to our national security, points out Rosalind Ereira, of campaign group Solidarity with Refugees. Some migrants sign up to support IS in exchange for their travel - the money paid by others to the smugglers &quot;helps fund IS activities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration officer is frustrated because he knows by sight many of the &quot;facilitators&quot; or people traffickers. These are often young men on benefits who appear mysteriously able to travel ten times a year to Dubai and Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the traffickers have British or EU passports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says: &quot;I have no power to stop a British citizen for longer than five minutes. I can do nothing without the traffickers' permission - and they know it.&quot; Despite the security threat, few in ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a Conservative MP suggested checking the age of young asylum seekers with dental tests or hand X-rays to measure bone density, he was accused of &quot;vilifying&quot; refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Norway insisted on a dental examination of arriving refugee children, they discovered nine out of ten were, in fact, over 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Chadwick of Croydon Borough Council warned a House of Lords committee last year of sexual exploitation in schools &quot;by adults claiming to be children and placed in a school&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A worker in a residential home in Kent said that half the children there are unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. She estimates more than half were in their twenties. &quot;They can be quite frightening at times,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are aggressive and have an attitude problem. Many have no respect for women because of their www.culture.No one is giving consideration to the risks they pose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another issue. Our most vulnerable children are in competition with these asylum-seeking young people for a limited DUBIOUS ... 'child' migrant number of foster parents, a limited number of places in care homes and, above all, a limited amount of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investment made by their families means most of the young migrants are, as the heads of various social services confirmed, &quot;very motivated, see it as an opportunity and do very well. They are largely middle-class, male and expect to go to university,&quot; said one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a contrast to the care leavers I interviewed. At the age of ten, Trevon came home to find his crack-addict mother hanging dead in the kitchen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lives of these kids are desperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lily Allen does not cry for them on camera and it is almost impossible to get them the help they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time to overhaul a system that is corrupt, dangerous and fails to help the most deserving. But don't hold your breath that anything will change, despite a vulnerable child allegedly trying to blow us up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration officer summed up the general frustration: &quot;You try to apply the rules only to be hauled up from on high and told to 'deal with it'. We are heading into desperate times.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prominent psychiatrist from Bangladesh has claimed Muslim refugees are more prone to terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Tanveer Ahmed said resentment against Australia combined with a feeling Muslims are 'hard done by' was a dangerous combination that could lead to violence as Sydney and Melbourne deploy extra police resources on Boxing Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'As upsetting as it is to some, minorities from refugee backgrounds are more prone to committing such acts,' Dr Ahmed told Daily Mail Australia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said refugees are more likely to become resentful, because they lacked qualifications and often had 'histories of trauma'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The social mobility that skilled migrants inevitably enjoy is less accessible for refugees,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is essential that refugees form a proportion of such a wealthy country like Australia, but is prudent to exercise caution and pick those that we can best help to prosper.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ahmed, who was born in Bangladesh and raised a Muslim in western Sydney, said Islamism was alluring to the likes of Lindt cafe terrorist Man Monis, who was killed in 2014 after a 17-hour siege at Sydney's Martin Place that killed two customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A hallmark of the underlying ideology of terrorism is a sense of resentment and a feeling that Muslims have been hard done by, both historically as a civilisation and as a community living in Western countries like Australia,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Much like the Lindt cafe siege and its perpetrator Man Monis, terrorism is an act of personal resentment that is then conflated with the political ideology of resentment that is Islamism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Those that latch on to such ideas are likely to be paranoid themselves and prone to blaming the outside world for their problems, known in psychological terms as projection.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ahmed said Islamists saw violence as a way to 'express their frustrations'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Islamism is a set of ideas that is cloaked in conspiracy, an inability to take responsibility for the civilisational failures of the Islamic world and an underlying belief in Islamic exceptionalism and its destiny to dominate,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Individuals who share similar traits, especially if they already have links to the Islamic faith either through birth or conversion, are more likely to latch on to such ideas and, rarely, act upon them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Those with a history of mental illness or deviant behaviour in the form of criminality will always be at higher risk.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man Monis, the gunman who killed cafe manager Tori Johnson, was an Iranian refugee who moved to Australia in 1996 before being granted citizenship in 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 2015, IS-inspired 15-year-old western Sydney student Farhad Jabar killed accountant Curtis Cheng outside Parramatta police headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He came from an Iraqi-Kurdish background and became to Australia from Iran in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 2014 Numan Haider, who moved to Australia as a refugee from Afghanistan as a child, was shot dead after he stabbed two counter-terrorism officers in Melbourne.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bangladeshi authorities will in effect detain the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who have fled over the border from Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the latest UN figures 409,000 Rohingya have entered Bangladesh from Burma, on top of the 400,000 already there because of previous waves of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With thousands of refugees now sleeping on the roadside or under tarpaulin the Bangladeshi police said over the weekend that they would limit the movement of refugees. Any new arrivals would be restricted to their camps in the Cox's Bazar area, near the border.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya will be made to live in their allocated homes and forbidden to move in with friends or family. Landlords have been urged not to rent out property to the refugees and transport operators told not to convey them around the country. Checkpoints have been set up at key transit points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With thousands more Rohingya arriving each day the Bangladeshi authorities fear that the refugees could swamp other towns and cities across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of Bangladesh, arrived at the UN general assembly in New York yesterday to press for greater help with the refugees and further pressure on Myanmar. She will address the UN on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of food and water shortages, heavy monsoon rain brought back swamp-like conditions yesterday to many parts of Cox's Bazar. About three inches of rain fell in 24 hours and more is predicted in the next two days, the Bangladesh weather department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rain had &quot;doubled their misery&quot;, Mohammed Kai-Kislu, police chief at Ukhia, said of those stuck in the makeshift camps. As relief workers have warned about the risks of malnutrition and the spread of disease, Bangladesh has promised to build a new camp comprising 14,000 shelters on 2,000 acres near the existing Kutupalong Camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma's military has blamed insurgents for the latest round of violence but 80 per cent of those fleeing persecution are women and children and there are babies being born along the way. Government sources have said that more than 400 babies had been born between the borders of Bangladesh and Burma since the exodus began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many mothers are unable to breastfeed their infants because of a lack of food and water. Only a few days old, these babies are already fighting for their lives. Anthony Lake, executive director of Unicef, said: &quot;Women and children on both sides of the border need urgent help and protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the charity is scaling up its response in Bangladesh Burma has blocked all aid to desperate civilians in northern Rakhine state, including babies and pregnant women. A recent World Food Programme report found that more than 80,000 Rohingya children may need treatment for severe malnutrition. The Burmese government has taken control of aid operations and Human Rights Watch said that this could become permanent, ending vital food and health programmes run by international agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, believes that the move is part of a government strategy to control the narrative about events. &quot;It's becoming clear that the Myanmar government may be moving forward with a larger political plan to replace agencies on the ground in Rakhine with the much more malleable and less-inclined-to-speak-publicly Myanmar Red Cross,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having the Burmese government lead a humanitarian response to a Muslim population it does not even regard as citizens could pose serious risks. Denying international agencies access not only prevents aid reaching those in desperate need but means there is a lack of independent witnesses to continuing atrocities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we came back home for lunch, we found it had been bombed and our parents killed. They threw a bomb into the house that killed my father and mother,&quot; says Nadal, 16. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We left our parents in a pool of blood. We ran and walked for three weeks from Juba to Lanya. We were sleeping in the bush and didn't have food to eat. It's good samaritans who used to give us something to eat for survival.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  South Sudan's million-strong refugee crisis is a test for the World Bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadal, his three sisters, Rachael, 14, Talia, 12, Lamya, 19, and brother Isaac, eight, are being looked after by another family at Imvepi refugee settlement in northern Uganda. Half a million children are here without mothers or fathers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss my parents so much,&quot; says Nadal. &quot;But there is nothing much I can do. I want to get quality education in Uganda and go back to South Sudan to take over what my father was doing. He was a great doctor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda is struggling to cope up with a staggering number of unaccompanied children fleeing violence in neighbouring South Sudan. They have lost or been separated from their families since the renewed fighting in their homeland broke out in July last year between troops loyal to President Salva Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of these children have witnessed haunting acts of violence and face exploitation and abuse - both along the journey and in Uganda's camps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agencies working in the area say around 100 children a day on average, 60% of the nearly 1 million South Sudanese refugees, are crossing into Uganda, a country now hosting more refugees than any other in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Uganda is experiencing the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world ... Many of the children have lost one or both parents to the senseless violence that is being perpetrated in South Sudan,&quot; says a spokesperson for the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. He says the war is creating a &quot;children's emergency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amalia, 14, from Yei, in eastern Equatoria, says: &quot;We witnessed terrible things on our journey. I was terrified and feared being killed. I can't forget how the armed people attacked and killed people on our way here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am facing a lot of challenges. I have no one to take care of me. I lost my parents.&quot; She doesn't know if her aunt, who also fled, is dead or alive. &quot;We took off in different directions when the fighting started,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have anything here. We at times have one meal a day.&quot; She does odd jobs for the foster family who have taken her under their wing so that they can afford to feed the extra mouths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judy Moore, World Vision's response director in Uganda, says the challenges the children face are enormous. &quot;We hear many stories of children's parents being shot by opposing forces. Some children as young as 10 are raped, they are deeply traumatised and they should not see and experience what they have seen and experienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Psychologically the children need counselling, food, assistance and stability. They need to adapt and learn different languages and different cultures, they have lost all of their friends and families so even socialising for them has become challenging. They think of how I can get a meal, where do I live.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the NGO is attempting to highlight the affect of the conflict on children through its #BearsOnStairs campaign - on Thursday, 700 teddy bears will be placed on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral in London to represent the number of children who arrive in Uganda weekly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as giving accompanied children medical and psycho-social care, the UNHCR and its partners place them with foster parents at refugee camps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World Vision has helped about 1,000 separated children reunite with their relatives and runs &quot;child-friendly&quot; spaces for counselling and play across Uganda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The dream for an unaccompanied or separated child is reunification with the family. We are stressing family reunification of these children as the best option,&quot; says Robert Baryamwesiga, the Bidi Bidi settlement commander. &quot;We should be supporting the foster parents with housing units, shelter and providing basic items, which we are not doing now because of the funding constraints. That creates a bit of a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN appeal for money to support South Sudan's refugees is only 20% funded. &quot;Chronic and severe underfunding is severely hampering the efforts of the refugee response,&quot; says a UNHCR spokesperson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are not enough social workers, meaning one social worker is currently responsible for 70 refugee children. There are not enough child-friendly spaces, meaning some kids are being deprived of a critical mechanism for addressing psycho-social distress.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of the children, all they have left are their aspirations. &quot;I am studying in a congested class,&quot; says Amalia. &quot;But I am determined. I want to go to university and become a lawyer, to help the community address the injustices and dispense justice to the oppressed.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want any more refugees coming here, there are too many. They live in new apartments while German children are going hungry and their parents cannot afford the rent. This must stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to The Independent on her return to a high-rise flat in a largely working-class eastern district of Berlin, this woman, who declined to give her name, said she had lost faith in German politics - but would consider voting for the anti-immigration Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland (AfD) party in Sunday's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is because of a spike in support in neighourhoods like Buch that the AfD is expected to win seats in the German parliament for the first time, becoming the third biggest political force in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to AfD representative Christian Buchholz, who won in the wider Berlin electoral district of Pankow 1 in last year's local election with 22.4 per cent of the votes, in some parts of Buch support for the far-right party is nearing 35 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded as a Eurosceptic party in 2013 by a group of economists, the AfD has capitalised on the anti-immigrant backlash to Angela Merkel's 2015 open-door policy, which saw more than a million refugees and migrants come to Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 17km out from Berlin's central Alexanderplatz and with few public transport connections, Pankow 1 has seen the construction of four temporary accommodation centres for refugees in the past two years. There are three such centres in Buch alone, each with a capacity to host about 450 people, and two are within a few hundred metres of each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heini Schulz, who lives in a tower block opposite one of the temporary structures for refugees, is a former voter for Ms Merkel's conservative CDU party but is now considering voting for the AfD. &quot;There are too many of these refugee camps here. I also don't agree with the government legalising gay marriage,&quot; said the 65-year-old retired locksmith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anna Buhl, also a resident of one of the tower blocks, agrees the area has received too many refugees: &quot;There is a lot of noise here, children living in the camp are heard playing and screaming until 11pm - my children would have been in bed by then. It's not true to say that a majority of people are happy with this policy,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Buchholz, who campaigned in the area for the AfD, was quick to tell Ms Buhl that documents from the German Senate, also seen by The Independent, state the refugee shelter cost taxpayers nearly Euro 19m (&pound;16.8m). &quot;Too much money has been spent on these camps,&quot; he said. &quot;To have an apartment in Berlin, people work and pay for it and can't even afford living in such nice a place. This money should be spent to benefit the people earning it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AfD's lurch to the right and adoption of an anti-immigrant stance have shifted the party's support base from one of disgruntled economists to voters who feel they have been left behind by traditional parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In nearby Karow, another container-built accommodation centre lies alongside a children's playground in between rows of residential homes. One man walking his dog along the centre's fence said: &quot;I don't like what is happening here, but I don't want to speak frankly about it. People in this area don't really want to talk about the problems here,&quot; said Mr Buchholz. &quot;Many here are afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Timm Westmark, of North Rhine-Westphalia, a traditional left-wing stronghold in the north-west of the country, immigration is also the fundamental reason why he supports the AfD. The 23-year-old law student also teaches German in refugee centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have seen the problems with my own eyes. People who vote for the [centre-left] SPD and have never seen what actually happens here say it's all OK, they are all nice people. But in the centres, I have seen people smoking weed and doing anything, they don't go to school, they don't work and there is constant petty crime,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Westmark added he had nothing against &quot;real refugees&quot; but strongly opposed the mass influx of migrants who were hoping for a better life in Germany. He told The Independent he often had to avoid speaking about his political beliefs, for fear of being singled out in an overwhelmingly left-wing area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Buchholz said this narrative was common with many silent AfD supporters fearing repercussion from their neighbours or their employers. &quot;People are afraid to say they are from the AfD. The situation is very agitated. Our campaign posters are being destroyed and supporters are being attacked by members of the Antifa,&quot; said Mr Buchholz, showing the fresh graffiti at the entrance of his apartment in the wealthy Prenzlauer Berg district of Berlin, a Green party stronghold. At home, Mr Buchholz says he has had to keep his AfD activities quiet out of concern for his two teenage sons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an area where Mr Buchholz would struggle to win over support anyway - not least as he is a firm denier of humanity's role in climate change. &quot;We have gained voters from all parties expect the Greens,&quot; he said, adding &quot;they are like New Zealand for us, like the other end of the world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while some AfD voters may remain quiet before Sunday's election when Germans voters will head to the polls, a feeling of excitement has spread through the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expected to win up to 12 per cent of the votes according to polls, there is little doubt the AfD's presence in parliament will shake up the consensus politics of the past four years. With Angela Merkel poised to win a fourth term in office and the centre-left again a possible coalition partner, the AfD could become the government's main opposition party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diem Fuggersberger fled the South-East Asian country with her family at the age of seven - not long after the end of the Vietnam War - to start a new life in Australia, but was forced to live aboard a cramped vessel with 500 other refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once-penniless Vietnamese refugee who couldn't speak a word of English is now a wildly successful entrepreneur.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Fuggersberger, who co-founded food empire Berger Ingredients, told news.com.au &nbsp;of the squalid conditions aboard the boat and said she was even intercepted by vicious pirates who robbed her and threatened to rape her family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There was no such thing as your own cabin or toilet so we had to share with 504 people. There was only crackers and snacks and water on the boat, not real meals, because the boat was too small... We had to make sure we made it to shore before we starved or ran out of water,' Mrs Fuggersberger said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Our boat was intercepted by pirates who took our belongings. They nearly raped my cousins and a few hours later the boat nearly capsized during a very big storm.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the horrific setbacks, Mrs Fuggersberger and her family made it to safety and took shelter on an Indonesian island, where they remained in a refugee camp for 18 months.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They lived in a house with five other families and the now businesswoman also recalled how she witnessed a fellow refugee commit suicide at the camp and survived an outbreak of malaria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time she was eight the Vietnamese-born family had migrated to Australia - however none of them spoke a word of English, they were all but penniless and only owned the clothes on their backs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Not knowing the language well enough and living in very poor condition has often tempted people to bully us and make racists remarks. It was a painful time,' she told Women in Focus in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a rocky decade of high-schooling Mrs Fuggersberger went on to marry wealthy businessman&nbsp;Werner Fuggersberger - but their riches were short-lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, and after two kids, the couple lost their $27 million business and family home due to the global financial crisis and the deflated former refugee was in enormous debt and back at square one again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In a way it was kind of worse [than being a refugee] because I had two kids to look after, I had 20 family members out of work who used to work for our previous business, and I was $900,000 in debt,' she told news.com.au.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a true testament to her resilience, Mrs Fuggersberger thwarted financial ruins yet again to create her multi-million dollar food companies Berger Ingredients and Coco &amp; Lucas' Kitchen in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berger Ingredients is a successful seasoning and food flavouring business and Coco &amp; Lucas' Kitchen produces packaged healthy meals for children. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inspirational entrepreneur also shared some sage words of advice for others struggling to make ends meet in business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'When cross roads open before you follow your intuition, trust your instinct and don't be afraid to choose the tougher path,' she said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT'S THE STORY?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNDER-FIRE de facto Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi is due to address her nation tomorrow as the Rohingya crisis deepens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is expected to &quot;speak for reconciliation and peace&quot; but will be absent from a key debate at the UN General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has called for urgent steps to end the persecution against the Rohingya minority which UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said amounted to ethnic cleansing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to one third of the Rohingya Muslim population have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh - which is also under fire for regulations that are preventing aid getting through to stricken refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 400,000 Rohingya have been forced to flee amid reports of rape, massacres and the destruction of entire villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guterres condemned the alleged involvement of Myanmar's security forces as entirely unacceptable and said the Rohingya were facing a &quot;catastrophic&quot; humanitarian situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we met last week there were 125,000 Rohingya refugees who had fled into Bangladesh. That number has now tripled to nearly 380,000,&quot; he said. Asked if the crisis could be classed as ethnic cleansing, Guterres responded: &quot;A third of the [Rohingya] population had to flee the country - can you find a better word to describe it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHY IS IT HAPPENING?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A MOSTLY Muslim minority, living mainly in the Buddhist majority state of Rakhine, the Rohingya have suffered years of persecution. They have lived in Myanmar for many generations but are denied citizenship amid claims they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the recent upsurge in violence, the army has denied targeting civilians, claiming it is waging war on militants. Attacks on security forces by a rebel group called Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) triggered the military crackdown but the UN has condemned &quot;excessive violence&quot; during the security operations and called for &quot;immediate steps to end the violence in Rakhine, de-escalate the situation, re-establish law and order and ensure the protection of civilians&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred thousand Rohingya were already refugees in Bangladesh, having fled earlier violence. Since the latest outbreak, more than 30 per cent of the villages in the north of Rakhine are now destroyed or empty. Tens of thousands of people have been forced to sleep in the open during the monsoon rains and many are going hungry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Zakir Mamun said his village had been burned to the ground and the people massacred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They came for us,&quot; said Zakir, who lost his adult son but managed to escape with his wife and injured grandson. &quot;People were ordered indoors by the military. Then the military and the mobs threw bombs at our homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAN NOTHING BE DONE?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE are two official refugee camps in Bangladesh but their population is now &quot;beyond saturation point&quot; according to the UN. About 70,000 people are in the two camps - with the rest of the 400,000 new refugees struggling to survive outside them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid is available, but the UNHCR, the UN's main refugee body, is prevented from helping anyone outside the camps because of Bangladeshi government rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh is already one of the most densely populated and poorest countries in the world so while the government claims it wants to support the refugees, it doesn't want to make life too easy for fear of being swamped still further. Fears are also growing that the Rohingya's plight may be exploited by terrorist networks intent on destabilising the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conditions in Rakhine are ripe for the influence of extremist stimuli, including the infiltration of Islamic State ideology, which may worsen the situation in Myanmar,&quot; reported researchers at Singapore-based Nanyang Technological University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extremists in Indonesia, which houses the largest Muslim population in the world, are already using the crisis to fuel domestic religious tensions, according to the political consultancy, the Eurasia Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are worries that the crisis &quot;will draw in more extreme Islamists from elsewhere in Southeast Asia, and beyond, to support their cause,&quot; said Peter Mumford, Southeast Asia head at Eurasia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHY IS SUU KYI SILENT?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN international barrage of criticism has been leveled at Suu Kyi for failing to call a halt to the violence against the Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most popular figure in Myanmar, Suu Kyi led her party, the National League for Democracy(NLD), to an overwhelming victory in the 2015 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the military still retain control in many areas, including defence. Security forces are the real power in Rakhine, where Buddhists fear becoming a minority and regard the Rohingya as illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military's story, mostly accepted by the general public, is that it is battling against externally funded extremists. This is largely unchallenged and the newly popular social media that is now accessible in the country has allowed hate speech and disinformation to flourish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suu Kyi could suffer a backlash if she speaks out against the military action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is that she has to move cautiously as there is nothing from stopping the military from deciding to replace her if she challenges what is happening to the Rohingya. It is possible, that despite her popularity, the tide of public opinion could swing against her to support the military if they took drastic action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she still has immense moral power in Myanmar and, as a Nobel Peace Prize winner and long time campaigner for justice and democracy, her silence is disturbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet so far she seems comfortable with the military using her to take the international flak against their actions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crew arrived to find an overloaded migrant dinghy with 132 people on board, including two pregnant women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Wilson, who is originally from Falkirk in Scotland, launched a rescue boat and distributed life jackets, before helping transfer the asylum seekers to a French navy ship that took them to safety in Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But during the rescue, his crew found the bodies of two children under a blanket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrants wait to be rescued by the Italian coast guard in the Mediterranean Sea, 30 nautical miles from the Libyan coast (Getty)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Wilson said the incident had a &quot;huge emotional impact&quot;, with sailors later undergoing counselling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a master, the hard part is lifting the spirits of the crew after such events and returning to our normal and familiar work routines,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The migrant situation in the Mediterranean is sad and heart-wrenching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some cases, the migrant rafts had run out of fuel, drifting aimlessly and hoping to be found. Others had no engines at all and had been towed out beyond 12nm and left to drift, again in the hope of being found.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a day after the tragic rescue, another migrant dinghy was spotted on radar heading towards the Deep Vision, which found 125 people crammed on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crew distributed food, water and life jackets and kept those on board safe while waiting three hours for a humanitarian ship to arrive, which took them to Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in the early hours of 31 January, another refugee boat was spotted next to the Deep Vision, which transferred the migrants to an Italian coastguard ship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian coastguard rescues refugee boat from Libya in the Mediterranean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, Captain Wilson's crew spotted and rescue six refugee dinghies in just five hours, transferring 650 men, women and children to safety - bringing the total rescued to 907.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sailor said he and his crew had been briefed for potential rescues on the passage between Libya and Italy, which is the busiest and deadliest sea route to Europe for refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Captain Wilson said the number of rescues was &quot;unprecedented&quot;, adding: &quot;The sheer scale of events and number of migrants were experiences took us by surprise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although his ship was working on a commercial charter, the 36-year-old said the laws of the sea require captains to assist any vessel at risk of being lost and anyone in distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am proud of the efforts of the Deep Vision crew in what were very difficult and emotional circumstances,&quot; Captain Wilson added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been recognised by the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society at its annual Skill and Gallantry Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commodore Malcolm Williams, chief executive of the society, said: &quot;Captain Wilson led his crew with immense dedication and professionalism, exercising high standards of seamanship and upholding the finest traditions of the sea in going to the aid of those in danger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has separately been honoured for his efforts with the Government's Merchant Navy Medal for Meritorious Service for &quot;for services to the rescue of refugees in peril&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2,600 migrants have died so far this year while attempting treacherous boat crossings to Europe, with the vast majority drowning, suffocating or freezing to death between Libya and Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People smugglers have exploited widespread lawlessness in the ongoing Libyan civil war to set up a profitable operation seeing migrants kidnapped and ferried from southern borders to the Mediterranean coast, frequently being ransomed, tortured or forced into labour and prostitution on the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian government has been leading European initiatives to equip, train and fund increased patrols by the Libyan coastguard, which itself stands accused of killing and abusing refugees, to prevent boats from entering international waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some NGOs halted rescue operations over the summer because of threats from Libyan forces, while one had its boat seized by Italian prosecutors over alleged collusion with smugglers, which the charity denies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been fears that a sharp drop in the number of migrants fleeing Libya could have been enforced by militias, leaving thousands trapped, after the Italian interior minister offered local tribes and Libyan mayors incentives to stem the flow of asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting in the ongoing war has recently reached the smuggling hub of Sabratha, where at least five civilians were killed on Monday and a hospital was partly disabled by shelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clashes have pitted the Anas al-Dabbashi brigade, an armed group previously known for migrant smuggling, against the Operations Room to combat the Islamic State, which formed last year to oust jihadists from the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting broke out when a Dabbashi brigade member was shot dead at a checkpoint, but the militia's leader claimed the underlying cause was the group's move to stop the departure of migrant boats following Italy's deal with the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Mediterranean has become both the deadliest and busiest sea route to Europe following the EU-Turkey deal, which dramatically reduced crossings from the Turkish coast by seeing all asylum seekers arriving on Greek islands detained from March last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 138 men, women and children have died attempting to reach Spain, mostly from Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 137,300 migrants have survived crossings to Europe in 2017, according to UN figures, mostly coming from Nigeria, Syria, Bangladesh and sub-Saharan African nations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLAND could leave the European Union as the result of a prolonged row over refugees, an expert has claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the EU moved to punish Poland over its refusal to accept refugees by taking away its voting powers in the European Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the row escalates much further it could push Poland out of the bloc, according to Renata Mienkowska, a political scientist at the University of Warsaw.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mienkowska explained the EU is unlikely to be able to punish Poland, which has refused to accept refugees into the country since the refugee crisis began in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will need a unanimous vote by all other EU members to ban Poland from voting on the European Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Polish reject 'EU OCCUPATION': Voices rise for Polexit  End of the EU? Poland OPPOSES bloc's plans for 'multi-speed Europe' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the bloc is unlikely to achieve this, given the EU has also moved to punish Hungary and the Czech Republic for the same transgression, and the three nations are likely to back once another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mienkowska told Die Zeit: &quot;The EU has tried to intervene on several occasions, but too little and too late.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unanimity is needed for the withdrawal of the right to vote in the European Council - it does not exist because Hungary is on the side of Poland.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only action against both countries at once would work. But within the EU people still shy away from this last resort.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poland has clashed with the EU over refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given this option probably will not work, the next step would be to bring Poland in line on the refugee issue by twisting its arm financially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this could have the opposite effect to what the EU desires, and send the Polish government out of the EU entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mienkowska said: &quot;If need be, it would be possible to intervene by restricting EU funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However the government may have no interest in remaining in the EU after 2020, after the next parliamentary election and at the beginning of the new EU budget period. If it does not pay off financially, Poland could say goodbye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It hurts me to say that, but an EU exit from Poland is absolutely possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she did not believe prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki wanted Poland to still be in the EU in three years' time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee dispute is the latest in a series of clashes between the EU and Poland's ruling Law and Justice party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first policy speech since being sworn in as prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki said he was opposed to a multi-speed Europe and Warsaw wants to have a say in forming the future of the bloc.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deeper eurozone integration has been dubbed a &quot;multi-speed&quot; Europe because it would lead to different rates of convergence within the 28-member bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polish PM Morawiecki has railed against EU plans for a 'multi-speed' Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Morawiecki said Warsaw's economic policy - based on generous public spending and a growing focus on domestic capital instead of foreign investment - should not change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want further divisions ... we oppose splitting of Europe between those are who better and those who are inferior.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a younger generation of Poles increasingly believe the EU is economically unjust - and think their country should quit the bloc as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young Poles told Express.co.uk they wanted an end to rule from Brussels, arguing the EU is an archaic institution that should be dismantled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bibikhal Uzbek was 105 years old when her son and grandsons carried her on their backs as they traversed rock-strewn mountain paths from Kunduz in northeastern Afghanistan through Iran and Turkey in the hope of seeking refuge in Europe in 2015.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Uzbek, who is just weeks away from turning 107, had her application for asylum rejected by the Swedish migration agency and was ordered to return to Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family say she is physically unable to survive the trip back to Afghanistan and have filed an appeal for her to stay in Sweden to live out the final period of her life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swedish migration agency said: &quot;Advanced age is not in itself grounds for protection&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Uzbek, who is barely able to communicate and has been lying unresponsive in her bed since the deportation decision was reached, was one of 17 members of her family to make the long and exhausting journey via Germany where she was given a wheelchair.</SPAN></P>

The truth is that groups from all parts of society are active to expose human rights abuse</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonno Revanche and Bridget Harilaou</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1045 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the activists desperately trying to draw attention to what is happenin on Manus, the Australian media has rediscovered a well-worn nickname: hooligans. It may be a slightly more tasteful pick than the often bandied about alternative &quot;ferals&quot;. They both arouse familiar images - mindless, attention-seeking youths who don't believe in a progressive movement as much as they believe in causeless dissent; idealistic people with unachievable expectations of their reasoned superiors who are &quot;just doing their job&quot;, socio-political opportunists with a reckless disdain for authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia's offshore detention regime is a brutal and obscene piece of self-delusion</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clever typecasting by a media that knows how to pull public opinion with a swift tug. Footage of young, justifiably upset and energised students is quickly harnessed in soundbites for current affairs programs. Police brutality against peaceful protesters is labelled as a demonstration randomly &quot;turning violent&quot;. The message this endeavours to spread is: the Australian public unanimously supports offshore detention, and the dissenters are merely dogmatic unemployed students complaining about whatever comes their way. The &quot;majority&quot;, it suggests, feels that imprisoning refugees is necessary for protecting our borders and therefore our conception of Australian identity and lifestyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the material reality reveals something else. It shows hundreds of regional Australians standing with Rural Australians for Refugees, protests in Bunbury, and grandmothers in Kyogle establishing a communication line with men on Manus. It illuminates the broad, diverse band of protestors from all age groups - white-haired women with the expression of steely determination perhaps more prominent than any other demographic. These aren't just students in Sydney and Melbourne, although they are among the many leading and organising these actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even among young people, the crisis of vulnerable refugees held without food, water or medicine is often seen as irrelevant to our life. Unlike the easy exuberance of marriage equality, which quickly spawned a &quot;come one, come all&quot; attitude in the wake of a hopeful cultural moment, refugee rights requires stringent self-analysis and discomfort. Our politicians are absolutely to blame on every front - this is unmistakably the doing of Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek as it is Malcolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton - but our silence does nothing to challenge the pre-existing plans and manoeuvres of those in power. Refugees are far beyond our shores, and despite our 61.6% yes vote, queer refugees held in these fortresses are somehow not our concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has made it clear that no matter what, our actions cannot ever produce a &quot;result&quot;, unlike the marriage equality campaign. Dutton says that despite what the Australian people want, &quot;these men are never coming to Australia.&quot; Is this not cause for concern - that all possibilities are ceded no matter what the public chooses? And is this quashing of diplomacy evident in the way police have shown up at the homes of protesters, demanding information about future actions and intimidating organisers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee ally activist Anna told us, &quot;plain-clothed police officers visited me at my home, refused to show me their badges and demanded information about protests. It felt highly invasive and unwarranted, especially given I had committed no crime in attending protests against the government's actions&quot;. Police also released images of activists to the media and had heated stand-offs with protesters in Melbourne. The specific type of policing, as well as harassment at the homes of activists, poses a potential threat to our civil liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know that our ability to voice concerns is narrowed under a dysfunctional system and that we are made to feel we cannot vote with our conscience - we know that our prime minister is treading down the path of many oligarchs that came before him - that he is an expert at appealing to monied Australians under the guise of so-called egalitarian policies; of utilising superficial engagement with rural and elderly citizens in media packets and embellishing a narrative of Australianess for a gullible international audience, and speaking only on behalf of the few minorities that coincide with his own interests. We also remain consistently aware of his dearth in integrity, of a tidy claim over a blatantly hollow image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As footage from Manus illustrates the violence, depravity and inhumanity being weaponised against refugees and asylum seekers, so too does the democratic right to protest escalate in all the major cities of our country. Spinning the narrative against protesters perpetuates the expedient myth of the &quot;feral&quot; activist and blindsides the advocacy of groups like Mums 4 Refugees, Doctors For Refugees and the Christian group Love Makes A Way, as well as the huge subset of Australian society taking a stand against government policy that tortures and abuses those who deign to ask for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The citizen journalism of Behrouz Boochani and dozens of other men on Twitter have been instrumental in exposing the abject human rights abuse being rolled out under the watch of the Australian Border Force, the Australian federal police and our federal parliament. As our politicians remain wilfully unresponsive, activists taking direct action to highlight the issue nationally and internationally are falling victim to police crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus protest: Christian leaders chain themselves to Kirribilli House gate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This targeting of activists is an attack on freedom of speech and the fundamental right to protest, with potential as a threat to our democracy. We need to call attention to the truth: that the Australian population that rejects the government's actions is wide and diverse, and that no matter the background of those speaking out against government policies like offshore detention, whether unemployed students or rural farmers, this response of escalated police presences and violence within the community weakens any moral basis to Dutton's response to the crisis on Manus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Conor Riordan, Press Association Scotland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland has met a target to provide homes for 2,000 Syrian refugees three years ahead of schedule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Government has committed to resettling 20,000 people fleeing the war-torn country through the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councils north of the border were to take in 10% of that number, but have reached that goal just two years into the five-year scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ``Scotland is an open and welcoming country and today's celebration, welcoming the 2,000th Syrian refugee to our country, is testament to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``In 2015 I made a commitment that we would take our fair share of Syrian refugees coming to the UK and the hard work and dedication of local authorities across Scotland has meant we have more than met that pledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I am proud that Scotland has welcomed so many refugees fleeing persecution and war into our communities so they can rebuild their lives here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics released earlier this month show Scotland has accepted one in five of Syrians brought to the UK through the resettlement scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those helped by the initiative include young children in urgent need of medical treatment and life-changing care, who are now building new lives across Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further commitment to provide refuge to 3,000 youngsters from the Middle East North Africa region has been made by the UK Government, through the associated Vulnerable Children Relocation Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those arriving through both programmes are granted refugee status and given leave to remain in the UK for five years in the first instance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of that period, they are entitled to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities can choose whether or not to participate in the programmes, dependent on local circumstances, but receive a five-year funding package to enable them to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All 32 Scottish councils have committed to supporting resettlement efforts, helped by COSLA, in whatever way they can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Immigration Minister will join the First Minister and UK Representative to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in COSLA HQ, Edinburgh, on Monday to celebrate the milestone and discuss the future of the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSLA president Alison Evison said: ``Scottish Local Government has responded to its moral duty to help and protect those whose lives have been torn apart by war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are proudly leading the way in our commitment to the Syrian Resettlement Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Council staff and communities across Scotland have truly gone the extra mile to reach the 2,000 goal - working tirelessly to make all the preparations for their new arrivals, finding suitable homes, helping to settle children in to school and supporting adults to find employment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis added: ``Scotland, along with the rest of the UK, should be proud of the way it has welcomed some of the most vulnerable refugees, and provided them with safety and security so that they can rebuild their lives.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1135 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High in the hills of the Greek island of Lesbos, in a former military camp now filled with containers and tents housing refugees and asylum seekers, the onset of winter has elicited particular dread. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the countdown to its official arrival, protests have become louder both inside and outside the facility, whose wall is graffitied with the menacing message: welcome to Moria prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the men, women and children forced to call Moria their home, the refugee camp is a daily battle for survival in conditions so desperate that even the Greek migration minister has warned they could be life-threatening. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For human rights groups, who have long sounded the alarm, the vastly overcrowded camp is a tragedy waiting to happen and an embarrassment for Europe. Now, as the rains begin to fall, authorities in Athens are taking action, pledging to transfer 5,000 asylum seekers to the mainland.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time in more than a year, Moria's population has dipped beneath 6,000, it was announced this week. The camp, originally built as a temporary measure at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015, was designed to accommodate 2,000. Most of its occupants live in flimsy tents whose only preparation for winter has involved using wooden pallets to elevate tarpaulins above the mud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At all hours the air is pungent with thick, acrid smoke - the result of plastic bottles being burned by detainees to keep warm in the absence of readily available wood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mounds of litter lie along pathways of slush and excrement, the latter spillover from lavatories unable to cope with a population that for the last 18 months has been three times over camp's capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moria [is] very bad,&quot; says Saleh Alhussein, a Syrian refugee, explaining that it took days before a doctor could properly attend to a wound on the head of his baby son, Mohammed. &quot;There are holes in our tent. This isn't Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After last year's accord between the EU and Turkey - a landmark agreement intended to curb the number of people attempting to make the perilous journey to Europe - an estimated 15,000 migrants and refugees came to live on Greece's eastern Aegean islands, the vast majority marooned by the complexities of an overwhelmed asylum service that condemns them to remain there until requests are processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesbos is not alone. Similar settlements exist on Chios, Leros, Samos and Kos, all within sight of smuggler networks on Turkey's Asia minor coast. But none is worse than Moria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesbos's mayor, Spyros Galinos, has for months been issuing increasingly panic-stricken appeals for the camp to be decongested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially inmates are free to come and go. Unofficially, says Galinos, it is a &quot;national disgrace&quot;, a giant detention centre where drug dealing, alcohol abuse and prostitution are rampant and clashes between rival ethnic groups rife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've run out of ways of describing conditions that are beyond deplorable,&quot; he says. &quot;I recently compared what they are doing here to Guant&aacute;namo but of course I've never been to Guant&aacute;namo. Perhaps concentration camp would be better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those considered &quot;vulnerable&quot; including pregnant women and unaccompanied minors are currently among those being moved to the mainland as the operation to relieve pressure on islands steps up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greece's leftist-led government had previously resisted such transfers, fearing they could encourage traffickers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galinos exudes calm despite facing mounting criticism from both the left and right in a country still reeling from economic crisis. The mechanics of frustration are in overdrive. Refugee anger is spiralling, but so too is exasperation among locals who at the height of the refugee drama saw more than 800,000 people traverse the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreigners, he says, now constitute a third of the population of Mytilene, Lesbos's main town, and he knows many who are afraid to venture out at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an emergency situation that requires emergency solutions,&quot; Galinos says. &quot;Since the summer we have been saying: 'Do something in Moria.' People are going to die if something isn't done, if the infrastructure isn't improved.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the government rushed in emergency aid in the form of containers - enough to house between two and three hundred refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With EU member states still wrangling over their duty to accept mandatory refugee quotas, Greece and Italy remain on the frontline of migration routes to Europe. Though the numbers are far lower than they were at the height of the crisis in 2015, boatloads of people continue to land on Lesbos's shores. Most are fleeing areas that were Isis-controlled strongholds in Syria and Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Moria, their arrival means further pressure - on space, resources and goodwill. The camp's workers and volunteers say it is now more packed than Manila, the mostly densely populated city in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been outbreaks of scabies but nowhere to isolate people. With space at a premium and clashes frequently erupting at night, women have taken to wearing adult nappies because they are too fearful to venture from their tents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing beside the camp's razor wire-topped inner courtyard, where asylum requests are processed, Said Asidi attributed the explosive mood to the frustration of waiting for a notoriously slow-moving system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 45-year-old Afghan acts as the interface between his community and authorities and has spent almost two years waiting for an answer to his asylum request. &quot;I have no idea why,&quot; he says. &quot;I've had three interviews, my last six months ago, but still no decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many Moria has come to embody policy-making at its worse - almost three years into a migration crisis that has prompted the most expensive humanitarian response in history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers such as Jeremy Holloman say the conditions on the Greek islands are comparable with emergencies in Haiti and Honduras. Surrounded by mounds of rubbish, the American describes how the drain behind him erupted when a pipe in the camp's overloaded sewage system burst last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this is the best Europe has to offer, I am shocked,&quot; he says. &quot;In 2015 it was an onslaught [in terms of arrivals] and very difficult to respond to, but two years later in 2017, we should know better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as transfers to the mainland, the Greek government is now pinning its hopes on Turkey accepting more deportees following a landmark visit by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to Athens earlier this month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the intricacies of diplomacy mean little to those holed up in Moria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Foley, an Irish volunteer, is is far from optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will [still] be a case of damage limitation, with NGOs struggling to meet needs that far exceed their capacity,&quot; he says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moria undermines everything Europe stands for. If you keep people in conditions like this, if you rob them of hope and condemn them to suffer, nothing good will come of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1079 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a week after Donald Trump was inaugurated as president of the United States, he had a phone conversation with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. The call focused on the deal earlier done with the Obama administration, under which the US would take a number of refugees currently held in Australian offshore detention centres on Papua New Guinea's Manus island and Nauru, and Australia would receive a corresponding number of people the US wanted to resettle elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time the deal was disclosed, its terms were very vague. In particular, no numbers were given: no one could tell just how many people from Nauru or Manus would be resettled in the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transcript of the phone call, released by the Washington Post, discloses several uncomfortable things. Firstly, the number to be resettled in the US is entirely up to them (according to Turnbull). More fundamentally, Turnbull's discussion with Trump is troubling because it shows that Turnbull has so little understanding of refugee issues and so little concern for the Christian faith he claims to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'Australians can see I stand up for them': Turnbull defends Trump phone call</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump was obviously confused about the number of refugees covered by the deal. Turnbull made it clear that the US could, if they wished, take none at all. He said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;...The obligation is for the United States to look and examine and take up to and only if they so choose - 1,250 to 2,000. Every individual is subject to your vetting. You can decide to take them or to not take them after vetting. You can decide to take 1,000 or 100. It is entirely up to you. The obligation is to only go through the process ....&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, Turnbull told the president of the United States that all the deal required was that the Americans go through the vetting process, and if eventually they took no refugees at all, that would be consistent with the deal. Of course, it was not consistent with the way the deal had been described to Australians when it was first made public. In November 2016, Turnbull refused to say how many people would be resettled under the deal, but gave the impression that America was committed to taking a non-trivial number. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump expressed his concern about the possibility that the refugees might be terrorists. He said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TRUMP .... This ISIS thing - it is something we are going to devote a lot of energy to it. I think we are going to be very successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TURNBULL: Absolutely. We have, as you know, taken a very strong line on national security and border protection here...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump referred to the fact that the US had once received a number of prisoners who had been released by Castro in Cuba and went on to underline his concern that the refugees might be terrorists. He said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TRUMP:.... you remember the Mariel boat lift, where Castro let everyone out of prison and Jimmy Carter accepted them with open arms. These were brutal people. Nobody said Castro was stupid, but now what are we talking about is 2,000 people that are actually imprisoned and that would actually come into the United States. ... We have our San Bernardino's, we have had the World Trade Center come down because of people that should not have been in our country, and now we are supposed to take 2,000. It sends such a bad signal. You have no idea. It is such a bad thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TURNBULL: ...none of these people are from the conflict zone. They are basically economic refugees from Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. That is the vast bulk of them. They have been under our supervision for over three years now and we know exactly everything about them....&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This did nothing to alter Trump's view. The conversation continued:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TRUMP: ...I will be honest with you. I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TURNBULL: I would not be so sure about that. They are basically -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUMP: Well, maybe you should let them out of prison. I am doing this because Obama made a bad deal. ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly Trump believed he was being asked to resettle criminals. He seems not to understand that a country like Australia would imprison innocent people for years. Turnbull, despite his experience as an advocate, did nothing to dispel Trump's misunderstanding and said nothing to justify jailing innocent people for years. After all, what sort of government would do that? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull must know that the Australian public are labouring under the belief that people seeking asylum are &quot;illegal&quot;. His government has called them &quot;illegal&quot; and, by treating them as criminals, has induced the public to believe they are criminals. It must be obvious to Turnbull that his party's treatment of people seeking asylum since 2001 has led the US president, and most of Australia, to believe that the people held on Manus and Nauru are criminals. It is the lie on which the Coalition has made itself popular. It is the lie which is essential if the public is not to see the grotesque hypocrisy of self-styled Christians locking up innocent people for years as a warning to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Turnbull's call with Trump pulls back the curtain - and it's not a pretty sight | Katharine Murphy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably Turnbull understands that boat people are not criminals, but prefers not to say so. But worse: he referred to them as &quot;economic refugees&quot;. It is a meaningless term. A person who is just looking for economic advantage is not a refugee. A refugee is a person who is unwilling to return to their country of origin because of a &quot;well-founded fear of persecution&quot;. It has got nothing at all to do with seeking economic advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, what the transcript shows is that Turnbull is unclear about what a refugee is; he is willing to punish innocent people for years in order to deter other people from seeking asylum, and he is content that the Australian public continue to believe that boat people are punished because they are criminals, when the truth is that they are innocent people being mistreated as an example to deter others from seeking help in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not surprising that Turnbull is troubled about the release of the transcript: it shows him at his worst.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently on BBC Talkback, hosted by the urbane sophisticate that is Dr William Crawley, I found myself defending some intemperate remarks by Vince Cable MP about hardline, reckless Brexiteers acting like jihadists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't agree with Cable's analogy but I certainly understood the frustration he feels about the dysfunctional nature of the British government in its negotiations with the EU. It's like being on board a runaway train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My foil was a Brexit blogger from England, who rabbited on about the will of the British people and sovereignty. The odd thing about these English commentators is that few seem to realise that the outlandish claims used in Britain during the referendum were largely absent from both the Leave and Remain sides in Northern Ireland. Though the chairman of the Northern Ireland Leave campaign (who went silent after its launch), admitted after the referendum that he was motivated by the issue of immigration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, I described the argument of my blogger adversary as rubbish as my patience on the subject is now wearing thin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt that the Leave side sold a wagon load of nonsense during the campaign and worse still they had no post-referendum plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brexit debate was too often framed by immigration fears both real and imagined. Most of it was baloney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UKIP grew on the back of it and disintegrated since. It wasn't long before Talkback listeners started to harp on about sovereignty too - which is sometimes code for immigration controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One caller said we need to do something about the boat loads of refugees coming from Africa and the Middle East who are wrecking the country. When pointed out that this had nothing to do with the EU - she gave no quarter. That the French and other EU countries are responding in a humanitarian way to the thousands of refugees fleeing war torn countries devastated by reckless western interventions and foreign policy, mainly driven by British and American governments, this lady caller was still unmoved. That there are no refugee boats landing on Irish shores wasn't regarded as a fact either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This level of ignorance is simply staggering. But ignorance is not the same as being stupid. It's difficult for some people to filter fact from fiction when the British press is so dominated by the right wing. The spread of keyboard warriors on social media doesn't help understanding either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But two stories about refugees deserve retelling. One of them has no fairy tale ending but both demonstrate the sense of desperation and desolation that refugees fleeing terror experience. Each is connected through a love of music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 23 this year another refugee boat sank in the Aegean Sea. Everyone died except two women, one of whom was pregnant. Among those who died was a 22-year-old Kurdish man whose dream was to study music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heroic Kurds, despite being at the coal face of confronting IS, have been let down by western governments. Baris Yazgi wanted to escape his war-torn country. He was worn down by the savagery of war. He fled with his only possession - a violin. On April 25, the Turkish coast guard found a body of a young male clutching a violin. When the relatives of Baris saw the photos, they heartbreakingly recognised him. His dream drowned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rami Basisah was just 21 years old when he had to flee war torn Homs in Syria. He too was a classically trained violinist. He travelled from Syria to Istanbul alone and then at his fourth attempt got on board a refugee boat. The boat was for 20 people but it held 50. As his boat sank and with his violin wrapped in cling film he swam to shore. He wandered from one refugee camp to another travelling on foot, he crossed eight countries and some 2,500km. Twice playing his violin he was rescued from camps - once playing Ode to Joy by Beethoven. He was chased by police and practically interned. He was also robbed of his beloved violin. Finally, he made it to Germany where a Lutheran couple took him in and one of their neighbours, a composer, gave him another violin. Rami has now produced a CD for the Red Cross to help other refugees. Ironically the story of his journey is told on YouTube to the backdrop of Danny Boy played beautifully by Rami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If only the irate lady on Talkback could hear Rami's violin - because it's not just his voice but that of Baris too.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no evidence that Isis is systematically using the refugee crisis to smuggle fighters into Europe or directly targeting asylum seekers for radicalisation, research has found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest of two refugees in connection with the attempted bombing on a London Underground train has reignited public debate, following four previous terror attacks in the UK this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men, an 18-year-old from Iraq and 21-year-old Syria, remain in custody after police were granted more time to question them over an attack that injured 30 people at Parsons Green station.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isis is winning the online war, report warns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New CCTV images released appear to show Parsons Green bomber</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parsons Green attack suspects 'were fostered refugees'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isis claimed responsibility for the blast, saying it was carried out by &quot;soldiers of the caliphate&quot; and threatening further atrocities in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New research by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) warned that the terrorist group was expanding its campaign in Europe as it loses territory in the so-called Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US-based think tank said Isis continues to plan, resource, and execute attacks from its remaining safe havens in Syria, Iraq and Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year has seen atrocities spread to the UK and Spain, as well as in Sweden and Finland, where the ISW said Isis was targeting &quot;vulnerable populations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timeline: European terror attacks since 2015</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum seekers launched two terror attacks in Germany last year, while the group used the refugee crisis as cover to smuggle the &quot;supercell&quot; of foreign fighters that carried out the Paris and Brussels attacks back into Europe using fake passports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ISW concluded that while refugees have conducted terror attacks in other countries, there was no evidence of &quot;coordinated Isis involvement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers warned that a larger threat came from the 2,500 remaining foreign fighters in Isis' ranks in Syria and Iraq, who are able to form links with jihadi and criminal networks in their home countries even if they do not return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ISW warned that Isis would continue to organise and inspire terror attacks in Europe even while much of its physical caliphate is being wiped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The anti-Isis coalition must also refocus on addressing the grievances and fears of vulnerable Sunni populations that make them vulnerable to Isis messaging,&quot; the report concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The widespread perception that European states and the US are aligned with Iran and the Assad regime against Sunni populations in Syria and Iraq, as well as the rise of anti-Muslim sentiments and perceived anti-Muslim policies in Europe and the US will continue to fuel toleration of and limited but growing support for Isis attack operations in the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isis is waging a social and informational campaign to gain support among Western populations - Western states will not be able to kill and arrest their way out of this problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of arrests for terror offences in the UK has risen almost 70 per cent in a year to a record high of 379, with the vast majority of suspects being British or dual nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Wallace, the security minister, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19 terror plots have been foiled in the same period but warned that the tempo of attempted attacks was increasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency, said there was a total of 142 terror attacks and attempts in just eight countries in 2016 - with more than half reported by Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK terror arrests up nearly 70% since last year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its 2017 EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report said Isis had exploited the flow of migrants to Europe to deploy terrorists for attacks and would continue the strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the report found there was &quot;no concrete evidence that terrorist travellers systematically use those flows of refugees to enter Europe unnoticed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europol previously said jihadis using the migrant route tended to be &quot;expendable footmen&quot;, while the most highly trained and dangerous operatives were likely to use false documents and more sophisticated methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given that it is in the interests of Isis to inflame the migration crisis to polarise the EU population and turn sections of it against those seeking asylum, there is a risk of some infiltration of refugee camps and other groups,&quot; said a report issued in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The extent of this is unknown, however, making the subject susceptible to exaggeration and exploitation especially by populist factions and extreme right-wing parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Images)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europol said Isis was also seeking to exploit the crisis ideologically, with German authorities reporting that jihadis have made at least 300 attempts to recruit refugees attempting to enter Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A real and imminent danger is the possibility of elements of the (Sunni Muslim) Syrian refugee diaspora becoming vulnerable to radicalisation once in Europe and being specifically targeted by Islamic extremist recruiters,&quot; a report warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is believed that a number of jihadists are travelling through Europe for this purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europol also reported that refugees and ethnic minorities were facing increased violence throughout the EU, saying the vote for Brexit generated a spike in hate crime in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency is recruiting 200 counter-terror investigators to be deployed to migration hotspots in Greece and Italy to identify suspected terrorists and criminals in what Europol called &quot;a second line of defence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two refugees arrested in connection with the Parsons Green attack are believed to have entered the UK several years ago as children, being taken in by the same foster family in Surrey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 18-year-old Iraqi and 21-year-old Syrian remain in custody as searches continue at their former homes and a chicken shop where the older suspect worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The younger suspect was arrested on Saturday morning in Dover, where he was attempting to buy a ferry ticket to France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The older man, named locally as Yahyah Farroukh, was detained by undercover police, including one disguised as a homeless man, outside a fast food restaurant in Hounslow later on the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland Yard said magistrates had granted warrants allowing the 18-year-old to be held until Saturday, and Farroukh until Thursday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week reminded us of the diplomatic complexity surrounding any Brexit-related agreement. Thankfully, one area does not require complicated negotiation between nations - it only requires the Home Office to update its rules. Today, parliament will debate New Clause 53, an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which suggests a way for the government to ensure refugee children are able to reunite with their close family in the UK without the need for perilous, illegal journeys across the seas. It is timely when so many children around the world find themselves fleeing war, violence and persecution and when the UK could do with some straightforward solutions for transnational problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now, the EU's 'Dublin system' allows the grown-up siblings, grandparents, or aunts and uncles of orphaned or separated refugee children stranded in Europe to request a safe and legal transfer for that child to reach them in the UK. It is not an ideal system, since it often requires the child to make a dangerous journey into Europe from somewhere as far afield as Syria or Iraq before the application can be made, and even then European bureaucracy is slow. Nonetheless, it does at least offer hope for many unaccompanied child refugees. The UK is unlikely to continue our participation in this 'Dublin system' scheme once we leave the EU, so what will take its place?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK's own rules for refugee family reunion do not recognise these relationships between sisters and brothers, grandparent and grandchild as being 'close family', leaving children unlikely to have a safe way of reaching safety with those family members. In extremely rare cases the Home Office might make a discretionary exception, but, for most of the unaccompanied children, desperation drives them to set out on that journey without any official support. Any sensible person can see how risky this is for traumatised children who have already been orphaned or separated from their parents. If they do try to reach another family member in the UK they are likely do so by being exploited by traffickers and smugglers, exposing them to physical and sexual violence before they reach the UK. And that is if they even get here; thousands have drowned or been killed on their way to Europe. A child's life is worth more than this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for this reason that New Clause 53 has received such support in parliament. Tabled by 42 MPs from all parties, including the Conservatives Nicky Morgan and Tim Loughton and the Labour MP Yvette Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to getting refugee children to their families, our government has the chance today to show Brexit as an opportunity to step up. Fixing the rules - as New Clause 53 suggests - will be an improvement on the system as it would not require children to make a dangerous journey into Europe before starting the complicated European process of family reunion. Allowing family reunion for refugee children through our own rules would require no international negotiation and could be accessed at our own embassies around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This government has shown that it can make the right choice by committing to stop the need for dangerous journeys by refugee children. Last year, it reunited 700 unaccompanied refugee children with their families using the European system. We should be immensely proud of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">60,000 Unicef UK campaigners have now called on the Home Secretary to fix the family reunion rules so that the UK has its very own system for protecting child refugees separated from family. When it is debated later today the government has a critical opportunity to do so.Lily Caprani is deputy executive director at Unicef UK</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-poverty charity Oxfam rented out the property on Airbnb, allowing four people to share their stories as a way of drawing attention to the refugee crisis as the United Nations General Assembly convenes this week with Mr Trump in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-storey Tudor-style home in Queens that Mr Trump's father, Fred, built in 1940 can now be rented by anyone for $725 per night.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The house was auctioned off to an unidentified buyer in March for $2.14m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam invited four refugees to talk with journalists at the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican president's administration issued travel bans on people from six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After various court challenges, the US supreme court last week allowed the restrictive policy on refugees to remain temporarily. The justices will hear arguments on the bans on October 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shannon Scribner, acting director for the humanitarian department of Oxfam America, said: &quot;We wanted to send a strong message to Trump and world leaders that they must do more to welcome refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump lived in the house on a tree-lined street of single-family dwellings until he was about four, when his family moved to another home his father had built nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[timgcap=]donaldTrumpTrumpTowerAug17_large.jpg[/timgcap]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an upstairs bedroom, Eiman Ali, 22, looked around at the dark wood floors and a copy of the book Trump: The Art Of The Deal on a nearby table and wondered about the home's previous resident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Ali said: &quot;Knowing Donald Trump was here at the age of four makes me think about where I was at the age of four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're all kids who are raised to be productive citizens, who have all these dreams and hopes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Ali was three when she arrived in the United States from Yemen, where her parents had fled when war broke out in their native Somalia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Buffalo's newest residents, young refugees from a variety of countries, receive welcoming gift from M&amp;T Bank ahead of the holidays.<BR><BR>At the offices of Journey's End Refugee Services, M&amp;T Bank today presented a surprise gift, new bicycles, to children whose families have settled in Buffalo after long journeys from their home countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees from a variety of countries, including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Iraq, Sudan and Nepal, the children received bicycles that employees within M&amp;T's Legal Division built at a recent teambuilding event.<BR><BR>'So many children list new bicycles in their holiday gift wishes, and we were thrilled to bring smiles to the faces of the children who received the bikes that our team built,' said Laura P. O'Hara, senior vice president and general counsel for M&amp;T Bank. 'The bicycles are not only meant to be a welcoming holiday gift, but we also hope they serve as another step toward a normal, happy life here in a city and country that are new for the children and their families.'<BR><BR>M&amp;T donated the bicycles to Journey's End, which selected deserving children for the bikes. The nonprofit organization has provided resettlement services to the families as part of its important mission to welcome and assist refugees living in Western New York.<BR><BR>'Journey's End Refugee Services really appreciates this generous donation from M&amp;T and its employees. It is another example of how welcoming Buffalo is towards our newest neighbors,' said Karen Andolina Scott, executive director of Journey's End Refugee Services. 'Many of us have fond memories of riding bikes with our friends through our childhood neighborhoods. Giving some of our young clients the opportunities to make similar memories embodies the holiday spirit and once again proves that Buffalo really is the City of Good Neighbors.'<BR><BR>Over the decades, as M&amp;T has grown, the company has always encouraged its employees to get involved in their communities, and many of its various departments often incorporate charitable activities or community service projects into their annual enrichment, education and teambuilding events.<BR><BR>'This opportunity to work as a team to build bicycles for children who are resettled refugees was a powerful experience - it helped us reflect on the immense challenges they've endured and overcome while also enabling us to help in a small but important way,' O'Hara added. 'It allowed us to grow as a team and give back to our neighbors in need.'<BR><BR>M&amp;T Bank partnered with Bert's Bikes and Fitness on the Build-a-Bike initiative for Journey's End and encourages other companies in Western New York to consider similar activities for their future teambuilding events.<BR><BR>About M&amp;T Bank<BR><BR>M&amp;T Bank Corporation is a financial holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York. M&amp;T's principal banking subsidiary, M&amp;T Bank, operates banking offices in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US president Donald Trump's childhood home in New York received some new occupants over the weekend - refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-poverty charity Oxfam rented out the property on Airbnb, allowing four people to share their stories as a way of drawing attention to the refugee crisis as the United Nations General Assembly convenes this week with Mr Trump in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-storey Tudor-style home in Queens that Mr Trump's father, Fred, built in 1940 can now be rented by anyone for 725 dollars (&pound;533) per night.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The house was auctioned off to an unidentified buyer in March for 2.14 million dollars (&pound;1.57 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam invited four refugees to talk with journalists at the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican president's administration issued travel bans on people from six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After various court challenges, the US supreme court last week allowed the restrictive policy on refugees to remain temporarily. The justices will hear arguments on the bans on October 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shannon Scribner, acting director for the humanitarian department of Oxfam America, said: &quot;We wanted to send a strong message to Trump and world leaders that they must do more to welcome refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump lived in the house on a tree-lined street of single-family dwellings until he was about four, when his family moved to another home his father had built nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an upstairs bedroom, Eiman Ali, 22, looked around at the dark wood floors and a copy of the book Trump: The Art Of The Deal on a nearby table and wondered about the home's previous resident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Ali said: &quot;Knowing Donald Trump was here at the age of four makes me think about where I was at the age of four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're all kids who are raised to be productive citizens, who have all these dreams and hopes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Ali was three when she arrived in the United States from Yemen, where her parents had fled when war broke out in their native Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she remembered Mr Trump as an entertaining character on Celebrity Apprentice, but has since changed her opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;To have someone so outspoken against my community become the president of the United States was very eye-opening and hurtful, because I have invested a lot in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Behrouz Boochani                     is a journalist and an Iranian refugee held on Manus Island since August 2014. He writes regularly for the Guardian, including a diary on the closure of the Australian-run detention camp. On Thursday he was arrested.                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I woke up as a thunderous sound echoed through my head. It was the sound of many terrified refugees rushing through Corridor M inside Fox camp. The sound came from out of nowhere and it reverberated right throughout the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're attacking!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Run, they're attacking!&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Behrouz Boochani exposed Australia's evil on Manus. The shame will outlive us all | Richard Flanagan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These warnings are well-known to the refugees in Manus prison. The cries of caution have rung out repeatedly for nearly five years. I immediately pulled out my phone from under my pillow and went towards the fences facing the jungle. The entire prison space was full of refugees running away and dozens of police officers moving in like a swarm of bees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With rage, the police chief announced repeatedly over a loudspeaker: &quot;Move! Move!&quot; He repeated over and over again that we only had one hour to move out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I diverted my course and went towards Delta camp. Our plan was that if they attacked we would all go over to Delta camp. The situation there was tense. A group of prisoners had gone on to the roof, and hundreds of individuals gathered in the corner of Fox camp and linked arms together. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the dirt road outside the prison stood dozens of police officers and other officers wearing uniforms I did not recognise. There were also a number of vehicles waiting to transport us to the new camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief and the representative from immigration continued their threats over the loudspeaker. The other officers just kept yelling at the refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had to find the best possible location: the toilets. From inside the toilets, the entire scene was visible and I could witness what was developing around me. A few people were crying. Worry was spread over the faces of the refugees; their reactions spelt anxiety and terror. But they all shared one thing in common: determination. They were determined to pursue their collective resistance, they were determined to pursue their peaceful resistance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration officers eventually sprung into action and destroyed the belongings kept inside the accommodation. They threw everything out of the rooms. They even tore apart the sweaty beds with their knives. A group of them smashed the empty water tanks. In the space of half an hour, the area between the corridors looked like a town hit by an earthquake or a flood. It resembled nothing less than a natural disaster - they wreaked havoc throughout the place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Decay, despair, defiance: inside the Manus Island refugee camp | Ben Doherty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees simply looked on. A feeling of absurdity gripped everyone along with a feeling of being forgotten. It was an uncanny feeling that comes with experiencing explicit violence. The feeling that you have no one, that you have no solace, that you have no sanctuary. In one instant, the equilibrium of the community had been completely unsettled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was put in jail, they sat me down on a chair. In the distance I could hear only moaning and yelling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two refugees began having seizures. Dozens of frightened individuals caught them from all sides. Everyone wanted to help. The sick men just moaned, they clearly had no control over the sounds they were emitting. At the same time the officers continued prowling around the corners of the rooms, they continued with their search and destroy mission. Also, the police chief was surrounded by dozens of his furious looking officers and continued shouting: &quot;Move! Move!&quot; The other officers were also swearing, they were looking for a way to escalate the violence. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had to return to Fox. On the way, two police officers pointed me out and came towards me. I ran away. I knew I would be arrested. But I tried to defer the arrest for as long as possible and remain there. I hid in one of the rooms. The officers entered the corridor. From there I could see the refugees who were monitoring the situation. The officers opened the doors to the rooms with aggression and anger - they told everyone to get out. For a moment there I wanted to hide behind a bed, but I felt a sense of shame. I remembered my time in Iran, I remembered my mother, I remembered how she was always frightened that the government officers would kill me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They eventually found me. Immediately seven or eight officers grabbed me by the arms and carried me outside in plain view of all the refugees. Like a scene where a dangerous criminal is taken away. Along the way one officer behaved just like a juvenile and pulled my hair. Deep down inside I was laughing. They shoved me aggressively. They struck me over the back, they hit me on the back of the neck, it was not damaging, but they still beat me. Each and every one of them beat me. One of them totally smashed and crushed my sunglasses under his boot. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone was furious and they kept shouting at me: &quot;You're responsible, you're guilty, you've damaged our reputation, you're guilty!&quot; The police chief was pointing to me, making accusations: &quot;You've always been antagonistic towards us, you've damaged our reputation!&quot; I wanted to respond, but he shouted me into silence: &quot;Shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They tied my hands behind me with rope. I remember how two years ago Australian guards tied some refugees - they tied them up so tight that for one whole week blood had clotted around the rope marks leaving serious bruising. But I know the Manusians well. Even when their anger reaches its peak, they still cannot hide their kindness. This time he tied me up in a way that was tight but did not hurt me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was put in jail, they sat me down on a chair. In the distance I could hear only moaning and yelling. They brought a camera and recorded me. They repeated the same accusations, they shouted down at me: &quot;You're guilty, you've damaged our reputation!&quot; And one extra accusation: &quot;You've forced people to stay inside the camp, you're responsible!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From there I could see the gate to Mike camp. Moments later they forcibly transferred a group of refugees to the buses. In front of the gate they laid one more kick into them. We were like a small country that had been invaded. I could still hear the sound of moaning and yelling. That place was really a war zone. What was going on over there? Once again, I remembered Iran. The shouting continued: &quot;Move! Move!&quot;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> China is said to be planning five settlement points for North Korean refugees as the tension between Washington and Pyongyang escalates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports have suggested that over a million of North Korean residents could swarm into neighbouring China if armed conflicts breaks out on the Korean Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kim Jong-un, North Korea 's Supreme Leader, tested the Hwasong-15 missile on November 29, its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile to date which likely puts the whole of the US within range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beijing's plan of North Korean refugee camps was mentioned in an internal document released by the Changbai County Branch of state-owned China Mobile Communications Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changbai County is a stone's throw from North Korea's&nbsp;Hyesan city and is home to thousands of residents who are ethnically Korean but have Chinese passports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, which started circulating on the Chinese internet last week, claimed that the Changbai County authority planned to build five 'refugee settlement points' because 'the situation on the North Korean border has been unstable'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wrote that the county's government had asked China Mobile to provide communication signals for the refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document claimed that workers from China Mobile tested the signals in the area on December 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When being asked about the alleged refugee camps, Lu Kang, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said on Monday that he was unaware of the plan, according to New York Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lu did not deny their existence, said the same report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to a reporter from Radio Free Asia, an official at the Changbai County government denied the alleged plan of North Korean refugee camps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changbai County, a Mandarin-Korean bilingual county, shares a 260.5-kilometre-long (161 miles) border with North Korea. The Chinese county is separated from the&nbsp;Ryanggang Province of North Korea by the Yalv River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 14,000 residents in Changbai are ethnically Korean, accounting for 17 per cent of the entire population of the county.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county is situated in the southern part of Jilin Province, which shares a long border with North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Wednesday, Jilin Daily, the state-run newspaper of the province, published an article titled 'common knowledge of nuclear weapons and how to protect yourself against them'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long article gave advice&nbsp;to the local residents on what to do in case of a nuclear explosion.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper also published comic strips telling people how to protect themselves against radioactive fallout and how to escape from buildings.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper article came a week after&nbsp;Pyongyang tested its&nbsp;Hwasong-15 missile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim Jong-un claims the missile is capable of carrying a 'super heavy nuclear warhead' and can bring the payload back to earth intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the test, America and South Korea launched their largest ever joint air drills in a show of force to Pyongyang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China then announced its own air drills, saying they were intended as a warning to Washington and Seoul not to invade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Beijing has distanced itself from North Korea in recent months, authorities are opposed to conflict on the Peninsula and to having a US military presence on their border.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Bangladeshi newspaper The Independent website on 8 September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukhiya: At least 230,00 Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh in the last 13-day since violence erupted in the Rakhine state of Myanmar in August 25, according to local sources, and the number of refugees may cross 300,000, according to a UN agency. Local public representatives and Rohingya leaders said an additional 52,000 Rohingyas, fleeing the army crackdown in their homeland, are now living in the no man's land between Bangladesh and Myanmar, waiting for a chance to enter Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our estimation at least 230,000 Rohingyas have entered into Bangladesh since August 25. The number is increasing every day,&quot; said Jahangir Kabir Chowdhury, Chairman of Rajakhali Union Parishad in Cox's Bazar. Two other union parishad chairmen, preferring anonymity, told The Independent that the number of Rohingya refugees entering Bangladesh in last two weeks would be between 230,000 to 240,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB), local administration and local public representative sources said the influx of Rohingyas into Bangladesh fleeing violence in Rakhine state of Myanmar is continuing unabated with the passing of days as the security forces in Myanmar are conducting 'cleansing operations' in Rohingya-majority areas every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme (WFP) of the United Nations said yesterday (Thursday) that the number of Rohingya refugee fleeing violence in Myanmar might exceed 300,000, warning of a funding shortfall for emergency food supplies for the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. officials have raised their estimate of the total expected refugees from 120,000 to 300,000, said Dipayan Bhattacharyya, who is Bangladesh spokesperson for the World Food Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are coming in nutritionally deprived, they have been cut off from a normal flow of food for possibly more than a month,&quot; he told reporters. The surge of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities which are already helping hundreds of thousands displaced by previous waves of violence in Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide clean water, sanitation and food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to estimates issued by United Nations workers in Cox's Bazar, Rohingya arrivals since the latest bloodshed in Myanmar started 13 days ago have already reached 164,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacted, Khaled Mahmud, additional district magistrate of Cox's Bazar told The Independent, &quot;As per our estimation over 52,000 Rohingya are waiting at no man's land to enter Bangladesh. Everyday new Rohingyas are entering in thousands, dodging law enforcement agencies. At seven points of Naikhonchhari upazila border no man's land, there are about 32,000 Rohingyas and some 20,000 at different other points of Teknaf and Ukhiya upazila borders.&quot; According to local public representatives' sources about 35,000 Rohingyas entered through Ghumdhum border points, 18,000 through Balukhali, 15,000 in Palongkhali, about 20,000 through Hnila, about 55,000 in Jaliapalong, 52,000 entered through Sarbang and about 35,000 Rohingyas entered Bangladesh through Whykong since August 25. Vivian Tan, spokesperson of UNHCR told The Independent that the Rohingya refugees are crossing into Bangladesh every moment and the number is constantly is increasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is difficult to estimate the exact number of refugees. Due to the huge number, we may need more funds to continue offering humanitarian assistance to them,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly arrived refugees were seen gathering beside roads and putting tarpaulins over bamboo frames to build makeshift shelters to protect them, including many women and young children, against the monsoon rain at different areas of Kutupalong, Balukhali and Leda. With shortage of food supplies, every passing day is becoming more and more difficult for these refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following an attack on 30 border outposts of the Myanmar Border Guard Police (BGP) and an army base on August 25, 2017, Myanmar's military started a crackdown, dubbed a clearance operation against &quot;extremist terrorists&quot;, which has killed over 400 people including 370 Rohingyas, who were identified as 'insurgents'. 13 security force members, two government officials and 14 civilians also died in the operations, said the Myanmar military on Thursday. Meanwhile, at least78 Rohingyas died in boats capsizes in the Naf River while crossing into Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visiting the different areas of Ukhiya, Teknaf and Naikhonchori this correspondent observed at least 50,000 Rohingyas waiting under open sky on sides of roads. More Rohingyas were seen arriving on roadsides by bus, truck, three wheelers and on foot. Myanmar is denying citizenship of Rohingya terming them as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. However, they were living at Myanmar for many generations. About 500,000 Rohingya refugees are already living in Cox's Bazar, who had fled persecution in Myanmar since the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMAGINE if the entire population of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport had no UK citizenship and the army and government decided to drive them out of the UK, murdering, raping and torturing some of them as they did so, all in the space of a few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well that's what has happened to the Rohingya people from Rakhine Province in Burma, since the end of August this year. Yet very little has been done about their plight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to August 2017, nearly 200,000 people had fled to Bangladesh. However, the speed and scale of more than 650,000 refugees from an estimated total Rohingya population of 1.2 million since August 25 this year has been unprecedented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I represent Cardiff Central, the most diverse constituency in Wales. There is a large British Bangladeshi diaspora in Cardiff Central and I had been watching this humanitarian crisis unfold with horror, as had many of my constituents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wanted to see the situation for myself, so in November, I visited the refugee camp at Kutupalong in the Cox's Bazar area of Bangladesh on a fact-finding mission with a small group of parliamentarians, organised by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing could have prepared me for the shock of Kutupalong. I stood on a hill in the camp in the searing heat and looked out as far as the eye can see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From where I was standing right to the horizon was a mass of humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to describe this living hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 60% of the refugees are children and many of them have been become separated from their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is very little food, mainly just rice, and many people are suffering from malnutrition. There's little or no sanitation. People sleep, cook, eat and defecate in tiny haphazard shelters, most of which are just a small piece of plastic and some canes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is very limited medical help and so many of the refugees are seriously injured and traumatised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I met one man who had been beaten and tortured by the Burmese military and as a result, had spinal injuries and was paralysed from the waist down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sexual violence has been widespread and horrific. Women and children I met were clearly traumatised and the fear in their faces is something I'll never forget. Aid workers are increasingly concerned about the risk of trafficking and sexual exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most powerful memory I have of visiting the camp is the young mother who had given birth to her daughter just a few days previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She slowly beckoned me into a tent where some of the most obviously severely injured refugees are taken on arrival and unwrapped her baby from some dirty rags on the floor and showed her to me with such pride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I looked at the baby, struggling to hold back tears. What chance did that child have of any sort of life? But then I heard about the mothers whose babies had been snatched from them by Burmese soldiers, thrown to the ground, stamped on and then thrown onto fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Families in Cox's Bazar have opened their homes to over 50,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bangladesh cannot cope alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It needs concerted international action to provide both immediate help, but also to stop this genocide by the Burmese military and shamefully condoned by the Burmese government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after I returned from Bangladesh, I met the UK Foreign Office Minister and the Bangladeshi High Commissioner to describe what I had seen and to outline what I thought the UK Government should do. I have followed this up by speaking in Parliament about what I saw and questioning the minister on further action and diplomatic efforts with Burma and UN Security Council members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More aid is urgently needed. Meanwhile, the hard line Burmese military have got what they wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not just to prevent the Rohingya from having legal status as citizens, but to physically eradicate them from Burma altogether through sheer brutality and force. The UK and the international community cannot stand by and let this continue. As well as increasing the amount of aid to the refugees, the UK Government should support a referral for genocide of the Head of the Burmese military to the International Criminal Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Government should also push for the EU to implement sanctions against Burma and there should be a UN mandated global arms embargo against Burma. So what can we do to help? Ask your MP to ask the UK Government to support the requests I have made. If you are able to donate to the relief effort please do whatever you can. Unicef, Save the Children and United Purpose are all raising funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My British Bangladeshi constituents and many others across Cardiff have been fundraising through the Bangladeshi Association Cardiff and have raised more than &pound;30,000 to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can help give that newborn baby girl the chance of a future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QabElias refugee camp - which burned to the ground last week - is a scene of intense activity despite the blazing midday sun. Two bulldozers drag up earth to create space for new sewage tanks, water trucks relay back and forth, and men, women and children are busy putting up timber frames for modest houses. Engines and tools mean it's so noisy families have to shout at each other to be heard. The smell of burnt fuel and metal still lingers on the edges of the camp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past week not just one but two devastating fires hit informal refugee settlements for Syriansin Lebanon's poverty-stricken Bekaa Valley - killing two children and destroying the identification papers and meagre possessions of some 1,400 people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Syrian refugees returning to war-torn country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both are believed to have been cooking accidents, which are common in the haphazardly built camps in which many Syrians in Lebanon live. While they are normally quickly contained, the July heat wave and nearby wheat crop meant the two blazes spread rapidly. Only five tents across both sites survived - and even they were heavily damaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The devastating fires sent towers of smoke into the air which were visible for miles and took hours to put out. For many in Lebanon - a country where one in four people are refugees -they have served as a reminder of the conditions many of the country's estimated 1.5 million Syrians are forced to live in, and given local communities the opportunity to show they still care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of people from neighbouring towns and villages have arrived at the camps with trucks of clothes, food, water and other donations, and nearby construction companies have suspended other projects to take part in the reconstruction work for less money they they'd earn on private contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very grateful,&quot; said camp resident Bardah al Ghanen, originally from Deir Ez Zour, a town now besieged by Isis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was heartbreaking to lose everything again. I felt numb about it. But we are touched by how generous people have been.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wary of how generations of Palestinians stayed in Lebanon after fleeing the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, when Syrians began to arrive in the country in earnest in 2013, the government refused to build officialrefugee camps in an effort to dissuade people from staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than six years of war next door, the plight of Syrians is no longer an emergency response; while initially many Lebanese went above and beyond to help their neighbours, the country has become accustomed to the misery on its doorstep. Some even exploit it. Trafficking of women, ruthless landlords and child labour have become endemic problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unaware of the macro benefits the mass influx of people has brought to the country - international NGO money has propped up Lebanon's ageing water systems and failing schools in recent years - Syrians are often the target of discrimination and dangerous levels of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths of at least four Syrian men in the custody of the Lebanese army following a raid that turned violent in a camp outside the northern city of Arsal earlier this month has caused particular outrage. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But still: the generosity shown by Lebanese locals towards those who have once again lost everything has been startling - especially when contrasted with the hostile attitude towards refugees in many Western countries, including the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a week after the fire at QabElias, the new semi-permanent breezeblock, timber and tarpaulin homes are 90 per cent complete. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What can you do, ignore those in need?&quot;, a volunteer with local charity Dar al-Fatwa said, handing out boxes of donated clothes. &quot;These people need our help all the time, not just when there is a fire. The only thing that will really make the crisis go away is if the war ends.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walking toward the arrivals hall at Dulles international airport on a typically busy evening, the Sadiq family might easily have been lost in the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the emotion that overcame the three women, a mother and her two adult daughters, was apparent as they saw the small crowd assembled to greet them, holding signs that read: &quot;Welcome to America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaz Sadiq, 42, wept as she embraced an old friend. Her sister, Rahila, 40, doubled over at the symbolic finish line of a long, contentious journey. The pair's 72-year-old mother, Doris, was wide-eyed as she scanned the terminal from her wheelchair, before offering a kiss to the advocates who waited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  In Trump's America, immigrant families would be kept apart. He doesn't care | Sohaila Abdulali</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just one week ago, the Sadiq family thought their dreams of building a new life in the US had been dashed, perhaps for good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 26 June ruling by the US supreme court put into effect elements of Donald Trump's travel ban on refugees and immigrants from six Muslim-majority countries. Although Pakistan, the Sadiq family's homeland, was not on the list of banned countries, the controversial policy placed a 120-day hold on all refugee admissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's beyond to express or explain what we went through,&quot; said Shaz, who confessed to having &quot;mixed feelings&quot; in the moment. Asked about the impact of not knowing whether the US would still open its doors to her family, she said: &quot;My mother suffered major depression. My younger sister, she started to have panic attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's difficult for others to understand even that pain - when you are already a stateless person, going through so many insecurities, and then you are uncertain about your future and do not have any control of your own life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after the Sadiqs touched down in Virginia, a federal judge in Hawaii rejected a motion seeking to limit the scope of Trump's executive order. The ruling pointed to a long road ahead for immigration and human rights advocates. The months-long and tumultuous legal battle over Trump's travel ban has already thrust many families like the Sadiqs into a state of limbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Sadiqs, the journey began well before Trump was elected. The Sadiqs are Christian, and fled their homeland after their father was killed in a church shooting and death threats became routine. In 2013, the Sadiq sisters moved to Bangkok. They spent four years navigating the grueling process of obtaining refugee status and applying for permanent resettlement in the US, which has one of the most stringent vetting systems in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supreme court will take up the travel ban again in the fall. In the meantime, it has instructed that visa applicants from the six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees must prove a &quot;bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States&quot; before being approved for travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  US travel ban will kick off 'summer of litigation', advocates warn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A restrictive definition of &quot;close family&quot; means only those with a specific set of familial relations will be allowed into the country. Those seeking to prove a relationship with an entity must show a &quot;formal, documented&quot; relationship with an institution such as an employer or an educational institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proving a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot; is likely to be particularly tough for refugees, who often have no ties to a country before arriving. The state department has said a &quot;formal assurance&quot; from a resettlement agency, such as the International Rescue Committee (IRC), will not count alone. This wording has left some resettlement groups unsure of where they stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the Sadiqs were processed prior to the supreme court's ruling, they were not required to prove a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot; in the US. Had they been required to do so, their application might have been rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family's only contact in the US was Kristin Kim Bart,  senior director of gender equality at the IRC and an old friend for whom Shaz had worked as an interpreter, years ago in Pakistan. It is unlikely that friendship would past muster as a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot;, said Ruben Chandrasekar, executive director of the IRC's Maryland office, which oversees the resettlement of roughly 1,300-1,400 refugees a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The travel ban makes for bad humanitarian policy and bad foreign policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ruben Chandrasekar, IRC    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are people that are fleeing unspeakable things,&quot; said Kim Bart. &quot;We have a responsibility as a country to help others and shelter others who aren't fortunate to live in peaceful times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're regular people, they want a regular life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IRC has vehemently opposed Trump's travel ban since its first iteration was unveiled, in late January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the very beginning, we have believed that the travel ban makes for bad humanitarian policy and bad foreign policy,&quot; Chandrasekar told the Guardian. &quot;We're talking about people who are fleeing terror, fleeing violence and fleeing civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The term &quot;bona fide relationship&quot;, he said, was highly contested and made the already complex work of refugee resettlement groups more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The supreme court's guidance, we feel, has been interpreted very narrowly by the administration,&quot; Chandrasekar said, noting the Trump administration had excluded grandparents from counting as a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that the administration will continue to expand its definition of what it means,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior administration spokesman was last week unable to provide examples of what might count as a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot; with a US entity. On Thursday, a state department spokesman told the Guardian claims would be assessed on a &quot;case by case basis&quot; and did not offer examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman confirmed that refugees scheduled to travel to the US &quot;on or around&quot; 12 July would still be allowed to enter the US without proving a &quot;bona fide relationship&quot;. The state department predicts that after 12 July, the US will have exceeded the 50,000 yearly refugee resettlement limit imposed by Trump's travel ban. After this date, the spokesman said, any refugee entering the country will have to prove their ties to the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing inside the terminal at Dulles, less than 30 miles from the White House, Shaz Sadiq called for a more humane approach to refugees. The administration has in the past expressed a preference for members of religious minorities, such as her family. Refugees, she said, should not be vilified whatever their background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your life becomes like hell,&quot; she said. &quot;You are not a criminal, you are a victim. Someone should be there to take care of you.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would take a while for the Sadiq family to put their ordeal behind them, she said, but for now she was looking forward to stepping outside without the constant fear of being arrested by immigration authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We suffered a lot,&quot; she said, pausing for a moment before allowing herself a laugh. &quot;No more traumas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee children could be permanently separated from their families unless the government includes family reunification in post-Brexit immigration law, the head of Unicef UK has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Injured, hunted, lost: mapping journeys of refugee children aiming for UK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global charity's UK boss, Mike Penrose, urged the government to commit to including wider family reunification rights in new immigration laws for when the UK leaves the EU.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees currently have the rights to be reunited with extended family members under the EU's Dublin III regulation. However, the UK's own rules cover only children and their parents, meaning any children who have been orphaned cannot safely reach adult siblings, grandparents or aunts and uncles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brexit could risk the ability to get children fleeing war and persecution to the safety of their close family in the UK,&quot; Penrose told the Guardian. &quot;Now is the time for the UK government to broaden its own rules and ensure the protection of unaccompanied refugee children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has said plans for an immigration system after the UK leaves the EU would would be revealed in a white paper this year, with a new immigration bill set to go through parliament in 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK immigration rules state that: &quot;Your partner or child can apply to join or stay with you in the UK if: you were separated when you were forced to leave your country, [and] you've been given asylum or five years' humanitarian protection but do not yet have British citizenship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules apply to children anywhere in the world, if one or both of their parents are in the UK. When the UK leaves the EU, British immigration rules will provide the only means by which children can be legally reunited with their families. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  PM accused of closing door on child refugees as 'Dubs' scheme ends</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penrose said the government should commit to widening the definition of family to allow refugee children to be reunited with siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles, as well as their parents, a right which currently exists only under EU rules and means children must make the journey to Europe before they can exercise that right to join family in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the Calais camp closed last year, over 500 children were found to be eligible for the 'Dublin' family reunion route,&quot; Penrose said. &quot;This route is now at risk. By making small changes, the government can show, just as it did in Calais, that it is serious about ending the need for children to make dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean in order to reach their loved ones in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity, whose headquarters are in Geneva, said the overhauling of reunification rules would tackle one of the key issues that pushes children into the arms of smugglers and traffickers in order to reach Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said it was too early to commit to changes but the government had a clear preference for resettling children and their families directly from regions affected by conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UK has a long and proud tradition of providing protection to those who need it and in the last year alone we have provided refuge or other forms of leave to more than 8,000 children,&quot; the spokesman said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both the UK and our European allies have a clear interest in ensuring that our strong cooperation on asylum continues and strengthens after we leave the EU. We are considering future arrangements but it is too early to speculate what these may look like.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollywood actress Pamela Anderson has implored Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to investigate claims of animal cruelty on Manus Island.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PETA Honorary Director issued a letter to Mr Dutton from her foundation on Monday, following allegations a dog was thrown from a moving vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her message, Ms Anderson writes that violence and suffering have reached a new level calling the abuse 'callous' and 'unacceptable'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is believed to have come&nbsp;from the Combined Refugee Action Group, who posted &nbsp;about a guard tossing a dog from a bus late last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Manus refugee carried Foxy to the bus. Cradled dog in his arms, (he) risked (his) life to save Foxy,' the post read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Guard allowed him (to) carry dog on bus but threw Foxy from bus at speed. Man now mentally unwell.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being made aware of the alleged incident, Ms Anderson penned a heartfelt letter calling on the Immigration Minister to conduct enquiries into the 'grave concerns' of the treatment of refugees and their animal companions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The prolonged detainment of these people is appalling, but recent reporting from the camps indicates a new level of violence and suffering,' The Baywatch star wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I&nbsp;want to share with you information about a particular incident, drawn to my attention by my friends at PETA.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'While refugees were being transferred between camps recently, a dog named Foxy, who was travelling with her refugee companion, was reportedly thrown from a moving bus by one of the guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went on to claim that animals feel 'pain, stress and fear' as humans do and that 'such callous abuse is unacceptable and threatens everyone in your care on Manus'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Psychology experts and law-enforcement officials agree that cruelty to animals is an important predictor of violence towards humans, and it appears regularly in the records of society's most vicious criminals,' she wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Just as we all love the cats and dogs who share our homes, members of the Manus Island refugee community care deeply for their animal companions and share with them the precious few resources that they have.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Anderson said that the animal's caregiver was 'understandably distraught' by the guard's action and that 'displaced people&nbsp;often form close bonds with animals'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Of all the things that refugees endure, emotional trauma is often the hardest to bear,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'May I hear from you soon that you'll launch an investigation into this incident and give Foxy and her guardians the justice they deserve?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident was similarly slammed by people online, with social media users writing it was 'another example of horrendous treatment'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Is there no end to the cruelty we inflict? What is being done to make a change?' one person commented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While another added: 'Are you serious!! What sort of person would do that to a defenceless dog and then the ramifications to the refugee's state of mind.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daily Mail Australia has contacted Immigration Minister Peter Dutton's office for comment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is alleged to have fled HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire 22 years ago, while serving a five-year sentence for drug offences. It is believed he had 18 months left to serve at the time of his disappearance, when he failed to return having been released on a temporary licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashworth has been charged with escaping from lawful custody and was due to appear before Medway Magistrates yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exceptional hearing could be sign of schizophrenia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who can make out a conversation in a crowded pub are more likely to hear voices in their heads and suffer mental health problems like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, a study suggests. Researchers found they had a three-in-four chance of being able to make meaning of garbled sounds compared to half of the rest of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of people who suffer from internal imaginary sounds were asked to make sense of a computer-distorted speech, alongside others who have no history of hallucinations. They were told to listen out for sine waves, &quot;alien-like&quot; noises which can normally be understood only if a hearer is told to pick out certain words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of three-quarters (75 per cent) of the group who hear voices in their heads could make out the sentence amid the noise compared to nearly half (47 per cent) for the other group. They could also do it faster than their opposite numbers. And MRI scans also showed their brains automatically responded to the sine waves with language, but not the meaningless waves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers, from both the University College London and Durham University, hope their results will one day help treat some mental health problems.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by UAE news agency WAM website on 10 December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UAE has donated AED55 million [around 15 million US dollars] to support education in Gaza in cooperation with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has signed agreement with the UNRWA worth AED40.4 million, or US$11 million, and a tripartite cooperation agreement between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, MoFAIC, the UNRWA and the Dubai Cares Foundation worth AED14.6 million, or $4 million, to support the UN agency's education programmes in Gaza, with the aim of guaranteeing continued access to education for local students in appropriate UNRWA schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sultan Mohammed Al Shamsi, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Francoise Vanni, Director of External Relations and Communications at the UNRWA, and Tariq Al Qaraq, Executive Director of the Dubai Cares Foundation signed the agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both agreements aim to support the strategic goal of ensuring that the requirements of various educational programmes for Palestinian refugee children in Gaza for the 2017-2018 school year are covered, which the UAE considers part of the pledge it made during the &quot;Cairo International Conference on Palestine - Reconstructing Gaza&quot; in October 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Shamsi said that the Emirati grant will promote the educational process in Gaza, including the development of curricula and skills, by providing various educational materials to around 15,173 Palestinian refugee children. The grant also aims to enable the UNRWA to provide a safe educational environment for the refugee children, by keeping their school facilities clean and healthy, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grant will also provide stationery, school bags and supplies to all the Palestinian refugee children, which will support them and their families, by covering additional financial expenses at the start of every school year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UAE is providing support and assistance to Palestinian refugees, as it believes in the importance of education in creating a better future for Palestinian students. We will continue cooperating with our partners to provide the necessary support and protect the rights of Palestinian children to education, and we are looking forward to strengthening our mutual efforts in dealing with urgent humanitarian issues,&quot; Al Shamsi continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to thank the UAE Government and the Dubai Cares Foundation for their generous donation to the UNRWA's programmes, which will provide basic education, health, relief and social services for over 5.3 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,&quot; Vanni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UAE was among the first countries for three consecutive years to pledge additional support, which has helped the UNRWA to fulfil its humanitarian mandate for Palestine refugees. We still need to collect $61 million during the coming weeks to ensure the continuity of our services and maintain stability in the region,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamida is one of 422,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled violence in Myanmar since August 25&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A persecuted Rohingya woman has told how she was forced to run from Myanmar's military moments after giving birth and before her baby's umbilical cord had even been cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamida, 30, said her village of Quachong, Maungdaw, in Rakhine State was attacked on September 2. She was at home, full-term in her pregnancy, when she heard a commotion outside, followed by the sound of explosions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her face was expressionless as she recounted: 'The mob invaded our village, they fired at us with rocket launchers and chased us and even shot us as we were running away. Then they set fire to the village and it burned to the ground.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With her baby due any day, Hamida was forced to flee to the forest with her husband and their six other children where they hid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 48 hours, they stayed in the forest. Then Hamida felt the first pangs of labour. Terrified, she realised her baby was coming but she had nothing, not even a blanket, and was forced to lay down on the forest floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The labour was quick, and three hours later she delivered a healthy baby boy. But suddenly, before Hamida had a chance to recover, she heard noises in the forest. Fearing it was the military, the family had to move or risk being found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the umbilical cord had even been cut, Hamida was forced to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I ran with the baby still attached. They were chasing us, and I knew they had guns and knives,' Hamida said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I was in agony, but what could I do? If they catch us, they kill us, and my newborn baby.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She does not know how long she ran. Blinded by panic and searing pain she clutched her newborn and prayed she would take him out of harm's way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the family were finally able to rest again, Hamida's husband cut down two pieces of bamboo and used this to sharpen the blade of his old machete. With this, he cut the umbilical cord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamida spent three more days in the forest recovering from the birth. There, she and her husband named the baby, Hossain Shaheb. With little food to be scavenged and no drinking water, the family had to make their way to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamida said: 'We just slept on the ground under the open sky, and we had no food to eat. We went days where all we found was water. The other kids were crying hysterically from hunger.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family walked for another two days to reach the Naf River, the border with Bangladesh. There, a boatman took pity on the family and brought them across for free. He offered his home to them and gave them the first meal they had eaten in days. They stayed for two nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the short stop, the family headed to the informal refugee settlement in Gumdum, where 50,000 refugees had temporarily resided. Hamida's husband bought some bamboo and a tarpaulin to build a shelter, and with the cooking pots and blankets gifted by the kind-hearted boatman, the family tried to make a home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We don't want to be here, we have no happiness here,' Hamida said, her voice cracking with emotion. She looked down tenderly at her 15-day-old son. 'But we had to leave, or we would have been killed.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sat under plastic sheeting that had been fashioned into a makeshift shelter, little Hossain whimpered in her arms, too feeble to cry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He's hungry,' said Hamida, looking down at him helplessly, 'But what can I do? I have no milk.' She had barely eaten in days, and as her body grew weak, she was no longer lactating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her other children pawed at her, asking for food, but she had nothing to give them. Her husband had gone to find an aid distribution and pick up supplies of food and drinking water. But Hamida knew there was not enough for everyone, and expected she would go to sleep hungry once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamida is one of 422,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled violence in Myanmar since August 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been clashes between different ethnic groups in the Rakhine state of Myanmar for decades. The Rohingya people, of which there were an estimated 1.1 million living in Rakhine, are denied citizenship, as it is argued they are not Myanmar nationals but descendants of Bengali immigrants. The Rohingya people claim they have lived on the land for hundreds of years, and that their parents and grandparents were born there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions escalated, and on the August 25, a group of Rohingya extremists carried out a series of attacks on police checkpoints, killing around a dozen people. In response, the Myanmar government initiated a military crackdown to deal with the 'terrorists'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events that have unfurled since were declared a 'textbook example of ethnic cleansing' by United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. The Bangladesh Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, who visited the camps to meet with refugees accused Myanmar of 'genocide'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving Rohingya refugees unanimously report mass killings, gang-rape and torture. They say that armed military and Rakhine youth gangs attacked their people and burned their homes. Access to the region is restricted, so accurate accounts of what happened are yet to be ascertained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As hundreds of thousands of civilians pour over the border, there are a growing number of testimonies that indicate gross human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few days, the settlement of Gumdum was cleared and refugees moved on to established camps. The Bangladesh government has allocated 2,000 acres to house refugees with plans for a super camp underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies are struggling after the unexpected influx of people - one of the fastest growing refugee crisis in more than 20-years. Most refugees fled in terror, with little or no belongings. Many are wounded and traumatised, and grieving lost loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions in the crowded camps are abysmal. People are hungry, thirsty and dirty. With few toilet facilities, refugees are digging holes they partition off with tarpaulins. In the frequent monsoon rains, camps are flooded and sewage flows through the camps. Water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea are spreading, adding another burden to already massively overwhelmed health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In efforts to meet the escalating humanitarian need, aid agencies are trying to scale up their response as quickly as possible. At an Action Against Hunger centre, 190,000 meals have been prepared for refugees in three weeks. Teams of volunteers prepare hot rice dishes, served at the centre and distributed at the camps tent by tent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With difficulties in getting resources to the rural and isolated corner of Bangladesh, many people are being left hungry. Nipin Gangadharan, Country Director for Action Against Hunger in Bangladesh said: 'We are urgently scaling up our response, but the numbers of those in dire need are unprecedented.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desperation has led to fights breaking out in scrambles for minimal supplies. At a relief distribution last week, three people including two children were killed as frenzied refugees stampeded a truck bringing relief packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, a storm brought 8cm of rain in 24 hours. Shelters in a settlement at the bottom of a hill were entirely submerged. Families were displaced once again. Some affected refugees were seen swimming to safety, while others used boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he helped his children into a canoe, Mohammed said that he had lost rice donated to his family, and cooking pots they had carried with from Myanmar had floated away. Nearby, the corpse of a middle-aged man was pulled from the water, and minutes later a woman ran to the scene in tears. Her father had gone missing the night before, and she wanted to identify the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res today warned that the situation was on the tipping point of a catastrophe. Robert Onus, MSF Emergency Coordinator said, 'hundreds of thousands of refugees are living in an extremely precarious situation, and all the preconditions for a public health disaster are there.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     HOW THE ROHINGYA CRISIS HAS ESCALATED                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya refugee crisis is worsening daily as new arrivals from Myanmar join more than 410,000 from the Muslim minority who have fled to Bangladesh since late August, overwhelming camps short of food, water and shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 25: Fierce riposte to militant attacks&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on August 25, hundreds of Rohinyga militants stage coordinated attacks on 30 police posts in Myanmar's westernmost state of Rakhine. At least 12 police are killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Myanmar army hits back fast and hard with 'clearance operations' in Rohingya villages. It says it is trying to flush out insurgents from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But witnesses tell of Rohingya civilians being massacred in retaliation, with mortars and machine guns fired at villagers fleeing to the Bangladesh border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crackdown sparks an exodus from Rohingya villages, which are soon burning so fiercely the flames and smoke are visible from Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 5: Refugee storm hits Bangladesh&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within 11 days of the attacks, more than 120,000 Rohingya have flooded into Bangladesh, overwhelming the handful of ill-equipped refugee camps around Cox's Bazar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many arrive desperate for food and water after walking for more than a week over hills and through dense jungle. Some need urgent treatment for bullet wounds and machete gashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh already houses at least 300,000 Rohingya in camps near the border. The fresh influx creates a dire shortage of food, clean water and shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 6:&nbsp;Suu Ky denounces 'iceberg of misinformation' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, under increasing international pressure, says a 'huge iceberg of misinformation' is distorting the global picture of events in Rakhine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first comments since the August 25 attacks, Suu Kyi says fake news is 'calculated to create a lot of problems between different communities' and to promote 'the interest of the terrorists'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureates Malala Yousafzai and Desmond Tutu criticise Suu Kyi. Hundreds of thousands sign a Change.org petition demanding the Nobel committee withdraw her award but it refuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 11: Violence amounts to ethnic cleansing, UN says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the crisis worsens, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein says Myanmar's systematic attacks bear the hallmarks of a 'textbook example of ethnic cleansing'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rights groups warn of a final push by the army and Buddhist mobs to drive the stateless Rohingya from Myanmar for good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landmines claim more victims, with three Rohingya killed in a blast while fleeing Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 16: Rohingya exodus tops 400,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN declares that more than 400,000 refugees have arrived in Bangladesh since August 25 - more than a third of the total Rohingya population of 1.1 million living in Rakhine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions at the camps become unbearable as numbers swell to breaking point. Women and children are badly injured in stampedes for food, water and clothes as aid agencies warn the crisis risks getting out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina departs for the UN to plead for global help in coping with the Rohingya deluge.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no evidence that Isis is systematically using the refugee crisis to smuggle fighters into Europe or directly targeting asylum seekers for radicalisation, research has found. The arrest of two refugees in connection with the attempted bombing on a London Underground train has reignited public debate, following four previous terror attacks in the UK this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men, an 18-year-old from Iraq and 21-year-old Syria, remain in custody after police were granted more time to question them over an attack that injured 30 people at Parsons Green station. Isis claimed responsibility for the blast, saying it was carried out by &quot;soldiers of the caliphate&quot; and threatening further atrocities in the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New research by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) warned that the terrorist group was expanding its campaign in Europe as it loses territory in the so-called Islamic State. The US-based think tank said Isis continues to plan, resource, and execute attacks from its remaining safe havens in Syria, Iraq and Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year has seen atrocities spread to the UK and Spain, as well as in Sweden and Finland, where the ISW said Isis was targeting &quot;vulnerable populations&quot;. Asylum seekers launched two terror attacks in Germany last year, while the group used the refugee crisis as cover to smuggle the &quot;supercell&quot; of foreign fighters that carried out the Paris and Brussels attacks back into Europe using fake passports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ISW concluded that while refugees have conducted terror attacks in other countries, there was no evidence of &quot;coordinated Isis involvement&quot;. Researchers warned that a larger threat came from the 2,500 remaining foreign fighters in Isis' ranks in Syria and Iraq, who are able to form links with jihadi and criminal networks in their home countries even if they do not return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ISW warned that Isis would continue to organise and inspire terror attacks in Europe even while much of its physical caliphate is being wiped out. &quot;The anti-Isis coalition must also refocus on addressing the grievances and fears of vulnerable Sunni populations that make them vulnerable to Isis messaging,&quot; the report concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The widespread perception that European states and the US are aligned with Iran and the Assad regime against Sunni populations in Syria and Iraq, as well as the rise of anti-Muslim sentiments and perceived anti-Muslim policies in Europe and the US will continue to fuel toleration of and limited but growing support for Isis attack operations in the West. Isis is waging a social and informational campaign to gain support among Western populations - Western states will not be able to kill and arrest their way out of this problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of arrests for terror offences in the UK has risen almost 70 per cent in a year to a record high of 379, with the vast majority of suspects being British or dual nationals. Ben Wallace, the security minister, told The Independent 19 terror plots have been foiled in the same period but warned that the tempo of attempted attacks was increasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency, said there was a total of 142 terror attacks and attempts in just eight countries in 2016 - with more than half reported by Britain. Its 2017 EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report said Isis had exploited the flow of migrants to Europe to deploy terrorists for attacks and would continue the strategy. But the report found there was &quot;no concrete evidence that terrorist travellers systematically use those flows of refugees to enter Europe unnoticed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europol previously said jihadis using the migrant route tended to be &quot;expendable footmen&quot;, while the most highly trained and dangerous operatives were likely to use false documents and more sophisticated methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given that it is in the interests of Isis to inflame the migration crisis to polarise the EU population and turn sections of it against those seeking asylum, there is a risk of some infiltration of refugee camps and other groups,&quot; said a report issued in December. &quot;The extent of this is unknown, however, making the subject susceptible to exaggeration and exploitation especially by populist factions and extreme right-wing parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europol said Isis was also seeking to exploit the crisis ideologically, with German authorities reporting that jihadis have made at least 300 attempts to recruit refugees attempting to enter Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A real and imminent danger is the possibility of elements of the (Sunni Muslim) Syrian refugee diaspora becoming vulnerable to radicalisation once in Europe and being specifically targeted by Islamic extremist recruiters,&quot; a report warned. &quot;It is believed that a number of jihadists are travelling through Europe for this purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europol also reported that refugees and ethnic minorities were facing increased violence throughout the EU, saying the vote for Brexit generated a spike in hate crime in the UK. The agency is recruiting 200 counter-terror investigators to be deployed to migration hotspots in Greece and Italy to identify suspected terrorists and criminals in what Europol called &quot;a second line of defence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two refugees arrested in connection with the Parsons Green attack are believed to have entered the UK several years ago as children, being taken in by the same foster family in Surrey. The 18-year-old Iraqi and 21-year-old Syrian remain in custody as searches continue at their former homes and a chicken shop where the older suspect worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The younger suspect was arrested on Saturday morning in Dover, where he was attempting to buy a ferry ticket to France. The older man, named locally as Yahyah Farroukh, was detained by undercover police, including one disguised as a homeless man, outside a fast food restaurant in Hounslow later on the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland Yard said magistrates had granted warrants allowing the 18-year-old to be held until Saturday, and Farroukh until tomorrow.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some child refugees have been waiting more than a year to transfer from Greece to the UK, ministers have been told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outgoing Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said he was aware of two young people who signed a consent form to be transferred under the Dubs scheme in 2016 but are &quot;still stuck&quot; in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Farron also questioned when the Government would meet its &quot;measly&quot; commitment to transfer 480 unaccompanied minors from Europe, noting 200 have so far been given sanctuary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dubs Amendment: Half of promised child refugees still not arrived</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His remarks came as he asked an urgent question on Section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is known as the Dubs scheme after Labour peer Lord Dubs, who was the architect of the policy which requires ministers to make arrangements to relocate and support unaccompanied refugee children from Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in the Commons, Mr Farron asked how many children have arrived from Greece under the Dubs scheme and if the UK has signed a memorandum of understanding with Greece to get the transfers under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I know of two young people who signed a consent form to be transferred under Dubs over a year ago, they are still stuck in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The horrific truth is that the longer this goes on, the more likely these children will go missing and fall into the evil hands of traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Oxfam, 28 children every single day are going missing in Italy alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will this Government step up or continue to ignore the plight of these desperate children?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Farron earlier labelled the Government's commitment to bring 480 children to the UK under the scheme as &quot;measly&quot; because it could &quot;do so much more&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed to Freedom of Information requests which, he said show, councils have &quot;voluntarily offered to accept 1,572 more children&quot; in addition to those they already support, something Home Office Minister Brandon Lewis said was &quot;simply wrong&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lewis said: &quot;We consulted with local authorities, which is what we said we'd do when this legislation was before the House; that's what has led to the figure of 480.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FOI request you are talking about actually doesn't look at what local authorities can provide, it's actually talking about the 0.7% threshold - which is an entirely different calculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But what we're very clear about is that making sure we do not create a pull factor, but at the same time we do the right thing - as we have done with the &pound;2.46 billion of support, making us one of the biggest contributors with the biggest humanitarian aid project this country has ever conducted to look after the people who need our care the most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead of playing politics with children's lives, we should get on with looking after them and I wish you would join us in doing that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lewis said the UK has a range of schemes which seek to bring 23,000 people over, adding that the Government needs to work with Italy, Greece and France while recognising they are nation states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Office ignores almost 1,600 offers to take in child refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of thousands of child refugees 'at risk of psychosocial distress'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government apologises for child refugees 'Yes Minister' admin error </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain 'could have taken 1,300 more child refugees, not just 130'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child refugees in northern France 'facing exploitation on daily basis'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Commons understands the Government's preference to take unaccompanied children from the affected region</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she added: &quot;I've visited the camps in France and Greece and the minister needs to be reminded those children are already there, often living in horrible conditions, and are particularly at the mercy of traffickers and sexual exploitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Abbott warned the Government against diminishing family reunification rights post-Brexit, questioning if it will &quot;walk away from its moral obligations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lewis said Ms Abbott's final remark &quot;doesn't do her or this House or this country justice&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative former minister Tim Loughton praised work he had seen in Greece, adding: &quot;There is a criticism that it is taking too long to get those children properly processed and assessed who have got a right to be here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MP Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire) asked what would happen to the Dublin III rule when &quot;we move towards this brave new Brexit world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She asked how many children had come to the UK under the rule already, and said: &quot;How are we going to make sure that those pieces of legislation are embedded in our own laws when we leave the EU?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lewis said the Government was &quot;determined to make sure we fulfil our commitments&quot; on Dublin III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Obviously as we go through the negotiations of leaving the European Union, exactly what format that will take in terms of technically what that Dublin commitment becomes, it's too soon to say, but we are very determined to stick with the moral and ethical duty that we are deciding to participate in in continuing to provide that support to people that need it most in the way that we do through the Dublin agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper criticised the Government for its &quot;shameful&quot; response and urged ministers to &quot;get on with&quot; helping lone child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Parliament told the Government to help lone child refugees from Europe when it passed the Dubs Amendment last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the Government didn't want to agree to it, but it was passed, and frankly, the way in which they have narrowed the criteria, dragged their feet, failed to even count the council offers properly, is shameful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lewis said the Government wants to &quot;give them the right support&quot; and provide families with &quot;the support network to be able to be an important and valued part of our community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important we do that within what local authorities can actually provide and within the restrictions that they have got and the capacity that they have got, and that is what we are doing to make sure they get the right support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2016 we did grant asylum or some form of leave to over 8,000 children, and since 2010 some 42,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we are doing our bit, we want to continue doing that work.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE of the next refugee crises will be in South America, and it is starting now. Hundreds of thousands have already fled a collapsing Venezuelan economy and political despotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the hardest hit by this exodus is Colombia, which is struggling to recover from a long battle with Farc guerrillas and drug cartels. The country has a 1,400-mile border with the socialist paradise of President Nicolas Maduro, as well as a long and difficult history with its South American neighbour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colombian Defence Minister Luis Carlos Villegas told The Herald that so far this year more than 300,000 refugees have crossed the border; placing heavy strains on health and education services.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to be prudent about what I say about Venezuela,&quot; said Senor Villegas, who then jokingly added: &quot;You may quote me on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained his prudence was dictated by the fact there were two million Colombians living in Venezuela, most of them with dual nationality. In the post-war years they fled politically divided and economically depressed Colombia for oil-rich Venezuela. Now that the tables are turned they are trekking back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our interest,&quot; said the defence minister, &quot;is in a stable and democratic Venezuela.&quot; Diplomatic sources, human rights groups and the proverbial man in the street agreed this is wishful thinking and the Colombian government needs to prepare for an influx of millions of Venezuelan, as well as dual national refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senor Villegas would only agree that was a &quot;possibility&quot;. He refused to reveal any government contingency plans. But according to the Medellin newspaper El Colombiano, in May, the government dispatched a mission to Turkey to investigate Turkish methods for dealing with Syrian refugee camps. And diplomatic sources say both the Colombian foreign and defence ministries have had discussions with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an influx of refugees will come increasingly strained relations between free market pro-American Colombia and the socialist Maduro government sinking under the weight of its self-inflicted economic and political policies and US economic sanctions. In August the Colombian government complained that a Venezuelan militia group crossed the jungle border into the town of Paraguachon, fired rubber bullets and tear gas canisters and robbed the local indigenous people. Maduro claimed it was an exercise aimed at preventing a US invasion of Venezuela through Colombia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Farc era, Venezuela's Hugo Chavez gave support to both Farc and ELN guerrillas, including sanctuary bases in the Venezuelan jungle. Withdrawal of that support was one of the reasons that Farc returned to the negotiating table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not inconceivable any refugee camps along the Venezuelan-Colombian border could become anti-Maduro hot beds.Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has joined the international chorus denouncing Maduro as a &quot;dictator&quot; and he recently offered asylum to Maduro's key political opponents. They will need it. With the urging of President Maduro, the newly-elected and controversial constituent assembly has called for any political opponents who support US sanctions against Venezuela to be prosecuted as traitors. The Trump Administration's sanctions are endorsed by the Colombian government but so far the Colombians have refused to impose their own. Washington has structured the sanctions so they are targeted on Venezuela's oil industry - source of 87 per cent of the country's income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US sanctions prohibit American banks from providing new money to the Venezuelan government or to the state-run oil company PDVSA (Petroleos de Venezuela, SA). The sanctions also bar PDVSA's US subsidiary Citgo from sending dividends back to Venezuela. They do not affect financing for most commercial trade, including the shipment of crude oil, of which the US is Venezuela's biggest customer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Venezuelan government has a $4 billion debt repayment due at the end of this year and only $9.7 billion in foreign currency reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Maduro government has hinted it might turn to Russia and China for help. President Vladimir Putin has attacked the US sanctions for &quot;aggravating tensions&quot;. At the same time, both Beijing and Moscow are upset at Venezuela's failure to deliver promised oil shipments, partly because the oil company is unable to pay port fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the economic crisis deepens. Inflation is estimated at 670 per cent. The country cannot afford to import food and medical supplies. If you can find food on your supermarket's shelves then you can't afford to buy it. According to the World Health Organization, 74 per cent of the population has lost weight in the past 12 months. Venezuelans call it &quot;The Maduro Diet&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deprived of a meaningful voice in their country's politics, Venezuelans continue to vote with their feet. Venezuelan applications for asylum in the US have jumped 150 per cent in the past 12 months. The tiny Dominican Republic has had 20,000 asylum applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trinidad off the coast of Venezuela and with a population of 1.3 million, has so far absorbed 40,000 Venezuelans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colombia, however, tops the leader board and is bracing itself for many more.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Progressive Democrats TD has defended her opposition to the resettlement of 60 Syrian refugees in Longford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mae Sexton, a PD deputy from 2002 to 2007 and an independent candidate at the last election, argued against accepting 10 Syrian families in the midlands county because it had a high level of welfare dependency and could not provide services to its existing population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she distanced herself from a new Facebook page Longford Against Foreigners which appeared last week congratulating her for her stance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I unreservedly reject and abhor the sentiment [Longford Against Foreigners] personifies, which I find repulsive and detestable and is against everything I stand for,&quot; Sexton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten Syrian families will move from an orientation centre in Monasterevin, Co Kildare, to Longford near the end of the year. They are expected to be housed in towns with second-level schools such as Ballymahon, Granard and Lanesboro, according to sources familiar with the settlement programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sexton said she accepted the Syrian refugees were trying to get away from &quot;horrendous situations&quot; in their war-torn homeland, but rejected the government policy of &quot;imposing&quot; families on towns across the country regardless of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Syrian refugees are not a problem . . . everyone of us as mothers and families would accommodate them in our own homes if we were able to,&quot; she told Shannonside radio last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This decision was taken at national level, and rightly so, that we would accommodate 4,000 refugees from Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the [council] executive and councillors have now agreed the government policy of imposing these communities on Longford is OK without examining the economic viability of such a decision in minute detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are counties in this country that have taken no refugees in this form and don't intend to take them. Longford cannot fully service our own community, never mind the new communities that come to live in our midst.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Mulleady, the county council chairman, said the neighbouring counties of Leitrim, Roscommon and Westmeath had each taken a certain number of Syrian families and Longford had to play its part in meeting the national commitment to accept 4,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of their move and housing would be co-funded by the EU and the Department of Justice, and would have no effect on anyone's existing position on the Longford housing list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They deserve a chance, they deserve a home, they deserve to live,&quot; said Mulleady. &quot;Whose parents in this country didn't have to leave Ireland and go to England or American to get a job at some point in their lives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people will have Irish passports and will have full rights to work here - that is a good thing, they are not just coming into 'the system' and there were councillors at our meeting last week who said their towns would openly welcome them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sexton received less than 3% of the first preference vote in Longford Westmeath in last year's general election and was eliminated without a refund of election expenses. She was elected as a PD candidate in 2002, lost her Dail seat in 2007, and failed to get re-elected in 2011 as a Labour candidate nor in 2016 as an independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For any government department or local authority to decide to place already traumatised and vulnerable communities into an area with a 60% dependency rate, well above the national average, and a deprivation index of an equally stark nature without first taking the state's own statistics into consideration is inexcusable and shameful,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR also revealed accommodation for the refugees and asylum seekers is still not fully constructed, more than three weeks after the detention centre was officially closed and Australia's immigration minister Peter Dutton said community housing was ready for detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'The situation is critical': cholera fears on Manus as water and medicine run out | Ben Doherty</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nai Jit Lam, UNHCR's deputy regional representative in Canberra, made the comments from Manus Island in a briefing to the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lam told the international community the situation on Manus was &quot;very serious and deteriorating by the day&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 300 men are inside the former detention facility without food, running water or medical care, saying they fear for their safety in the Lorengau community. There have been frequent attacks on detainees and well-documented tensions with locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Inside the centre the situation was &quot;desperate&quot;, and outside, where authorities claim the men have accommodation and services waiting for them, it is &quot;profoundly inadequate&quot;, Lam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia remained responsible for the refugees and asylum seekers, Lam said, accusing the country's government of in effect creating and then abandoning &quot;a humanitarian crisis at the doorstep of the international community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is vital that Australia take responsibility and play an active role in achieving solutions for all the people Australia forcibly transferred to Papua New Guinea,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a manmade and entirely preventable humanitarian crisis. It is a damning indictment of a policy meant to avoid Australia's international obligations.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has been on the ground since the end of last month, and Lam detailed the current situation, which Lam described as the consequences of a problem created four years ago, &quot;when Australia forcibly transferred people, refugees and asylum seekers to PNG and Nauru under their offshore policy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubbish and waste was accumulating inside the centre, where services and water have been shut down, and health and sanitation was becoming a significant issue, as was the risk of disease, Lam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four members of staff assigned to look after the cases of the 700 men are not working due to local contractual disputes, the UN observed. Local tensions remain high with at least two further incidents at alternative accommodation units in the past week, including a break-in and switching off of a generator in the middle of the night, and a road blockade by locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hillside Haus has no power. Last night some local men went inside the prison camp there and turned off the generators and took the cables. There are about 30 refugees there.- Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 18, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some local people came inside the Hillside prison camp and turned off the generators. The locals are extremely angry because the generators are very noisy. The disturbing point here is that security officers could not prevent them and were really scared- Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 17, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beyond the physical accommodation that we have been talking about, the most basic services needed for asylum seekers and refugees are still not adequately provided for outside the centre,&quot; Lam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His observations concluded that accommodation was still under major construction and possibly weeks away from completion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After three weeks and constant announcements that alternative accommodation outside the centre and together with the services are ready, what we have observed so far actually represents a very different picture,&quot; Lam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees and Manusian staff on the island have told the Guardian that the centres are not yet habitable. Pictures show heavy earth-moving equipment still on the sites, and work continuing to build fences and install services. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the West Lorengau centre running water is available only intermittently, sometimes only for an hour a day, and the supply of electricity is similarly intermittent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Decay, despair, defiance: inside the Manus Island refugee camp | Ben Doherty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has turned a deaf ear to the pleas of the refugees and asylum seekers, international human rights organisations, the Australian Medical Association, and the government of New Zealand, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has called the situation unacceptable and has sought to offer her country's assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, having  had its offer to resettle 150 refugees rejected, the New Zealand government offered $2.7m to PNG to provide essential services on Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton dismissed the offer, saying it would be better spent on &quot;another environment somewhere, to Indonesia for example&quot;, and suggested Australia's border protection policies had benefited New Zealand because boats were not getting to Auckland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also warned against PNG and New Zealand making any kind of deal without Australia's involvement,  saying the two countries would have to think about their relationships with Australia and what kind of impact a deal would have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government was prioritising a deal made with the US's Obama administration to take up to 1,200 refugees, but only 54 have so far been resettled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the half a million Rohingya refugees that have poured into Bangladesh, approximately 145,000 are children under the age of five at risk of malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Disasters Emergency Committee charity, at least 14,000 Rohingya refugee children in Bangladesh are already suffering from &quot;severe acute malnutrition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women are also in dire need of proper food rations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN 'scrapped report that predicted Rohingya Muslim crisis'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influx of Rohingya from the western Burmese state of Rakhine into Bangladesh since 25 August is &quot;the world's fastest developing refugee emergency,&quot; according to the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evan Schuurman, spokesperson for Save the Children's humanitarian response team in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the &quot;sheer speed&quot; at which the crisis has escalated which provides the biggest challenge for relief efforts and providing aid to children and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding from Bangladesh, Mr Schuurman said that amounts to an average of 10,000 people a day, every day, in the last six weeks. &quot;It's truly staggering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslims flee violence in Burma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr Guterres' spokesperson Farhan Haq, there were already approximately 200,000 Rohingya in Bangladesh before the latest deluge of people began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Taravella, WFP's senior spokesperson told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that though this crisis mimics others in terms of &quot;desperation, violence, separated families, blocked access to aid, people too weak from hunger to walk on their own&quot; the situation is exacerbated by Bangladesh's own problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The flow of people is constant and rapid and overwhelming a country that is struggling to manage its own development needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another issue in Bangladesh this time a year - monsoon season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Schuurman said the rains have hit the country &quot;particularly hard&quot; this season, causing flooding, transportation, and logistics issues for aid workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It &quot;has put huge pressure on host communities and basic services,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An inundation of illegal drugs over the Burmese border and smaller share of existing food and clean water resources are concerns for poorer villagers in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Climate change has been a primary concern for the South Asian country, but in order to help the influx of newly arrived refugees Bangladesh has taken deforestation to make room for expanded tent communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government allocated 2,000 acres when the number of refugees was nearly 400,000,&quot; the Secretary of Disaster Management and Relief Mohammad Shah Kamal told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 1,000 acres more have been allocated to accommodate up to 150,000 makeshift tarpaulin shelters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As more and more trees are cut down, the natural habitat of animals like elephants is increasingly encroached upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wild elephants crushed two refugees to death in September and authorities fear it could happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya have faced decades of discrimination and persecution by the majority Buddhist population in Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship despite centuries-old roots in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current crisis erupted when an insurgent Rohingya group attacked police posts in Rakhine state, killing a dozen security personnel - an act that Mr Guterres condemned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks prompted Burma's military to launch &quot;clearance operations&quot; against the rebels, setting off a wave of violence that has left hundreds dead, thousands of homes burned and began the mass exodus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has called on Burma and its controversial, once-hailed, prominent politicianAung San Suu Kyi to allow for the safe return of Rohingya to their homes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma cancels visit to site of alleged ethnic killing 'due to weather'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Suu Kyi's position as state counsellor does not give her authority over the military, but the international criticism is for her failure to speak out against alleged human rights abuses - including mass killings, gang rapes, and the burning of villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has made an appeal of $434 million to assist more than a million people for the coming six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hope is that the political situation will be resolved by then in order to avoid an enduring crisis, for which Bangladesh and its already struggling economy will likely have to bear the financial brunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further complicating the relief response to help these refugees is the growing refugee and famine crises in the rest of the world. Nearly 20 million are on the brink of famine in Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia, and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian refugees are still living in camps in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme did receive a contribution from the US government to the tune of $1.18bn but Mr Taravella said that though this is &quot;an enormous help at the global level&quot; the agency cannot apply any of it to this particular crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is currently providing rice rations for about 580,000 people at the moment however in order to fully address food-based needs in Bangladesh for the next six months, WFP would need $73.2 million - that would ensure rations for one million people to include new arrivals, refugees who fled before August 2017, actual registered refugees, and people living within host communities who still need help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency would also require around $7m for logistics and emergency telecommunications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, about $20m of the total $80m has been secured through country contributions from Europe, US, UK, Australia, and Canada. But, Mr Taravella estimated that would only cover food rations up to middle of November of this year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A children's story about a bumbling bear with a heart of gold is perhaps not the first place you would expect to glean insights into the trauma of the Second World War or the plight of the refugee. But Michael Bond's Paddington was born into a world torn to pieces by a destructive conflict. His story is that of the refugee - and it remains as relevant today as it was when Bond, who died aged 91 on June 27, created him in the 1950s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paddington comes out of a certain kind of war trauma. Newsreel footage of the Nazis moving people out of their homes in the 1930s stuck with Bond: &quot;Footage of elderly people pushing prams with all their belongings in them. Refugees are the saddest sight; I still think that,&quot; Bond said in 2014 - just as his creation was about to reach a new generation with a big-screen adaption. There had been no shortage of trauma for Bond himself. He left school very young and was 17 when he volunteered for aircrew service in the RAF. He joined up after surviving a serious bombing raid in Reading that killed many of the people working in his building. But flying didn't agree with him - so, after suffering chronic airsickness, he moved to the Middlesex regiment of the British Army. Still a child himself, the war transformed him and perhaps also globalised him, pushing back the borders of his vision of the world to encompass other places and peoples. For, although he sets his Paddington stories in a safe middle-class house in West London, Paddington himself comes from elsewhere, somewhere so far-flung to be the other side of the world - &quot;Darkest Peru&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a stowaway Paddington travelled illegally by boat and was taken in by comfortably off London family. But the bear's famous label is also very important, signalling his role as a figure for a series of memories about the trauma of the Second World War. Bond recalled watching images of evacuee and refugee children wearing labels at train stations. Bond bears witness to experiences of the huge number of people displaced by the war and of refugees and migrants in the post-war era who combine to create a sympathetic character in Paddington and a strong ethical message in Bond's writing of the value of hospitality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of writing the first Paddington book in 1962, Bond lived in a flat on Portobello Road with his first wife, not in the large middle-class house with housekeeper that he imagined for the book. This part of west London was a key site of immigration, its cosmopolitan population associated with the arrival of Caribbean workers in the post-war era and refugees from across Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paddington's great ally, Mr Gruber, runs an antique shop there - this character was based on his literary agent Harvey Unna, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany. Bond said that his main complaint about the film adaptation of Paddington was he wanted someone foreign to play Gruber, &quot;because he was based on my first agent, a lovely man, a German Jew, who was in line to be the youngest judge in Germany, when he was warned his name was on a list, so he got out and came to England with just a suitcase and &pound;25 to his name&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Gruber is tolerant and hospitable, educated and a guardian of all that is precious and beautiful from the past. And as an older more experienced refugee, he plays a valuable role in signposting for Paddington the way to negotiate a safe place in an alien culture and how to cope with the trauma of uprooting and remaking &quot;the self &quot;. It is this vulnerability, moved from fiction to reality, that the playwright Michael Morpurgo believes makes the Paddington story powerful to this day: &quot;We only have to see that bear to see the predicament of a Syrian child. The Brown family adopted him, it was a messy adoption but it gave the bear a home. It delivers a very strong message about how we've grown away from the kindness to which we once aspired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bond's own commitment to refugees continued until his death. He led a campaign - along with more than 60 children's authors and illustrators - to highlight the government's continued detention of hundreds of child asylum-seekers in prison-like conditions. Paddington himself forwarded a personal message to the children at Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in 2009. Paddington said their plight reminded him how lucky he was to be living at number 32 Windsor Gardens &quot;with such nice people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generations of readers have stood in Paddington's shoes. Maybe that was Bond's greatest gift to us. He encouraged us not to see refugees as scary &quot;others&quot; - but as people who may just appreciate a warm hug and a marmalade sandwich.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four hundred and twenty-one refugees and asylum seekers holed up in the Manus Island detention centre have been told by Papua New Guinea's government they must leave on Monday or face forcible eviction, as another legal challenge goes to court, and international pressure continues to mount on Australia to intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men remaining in the camp have been living there without electricity, running water, regular food supplies and medicine for 13 days. They say they are thirsty, hungry and sick, but resolute, and they are refusing to leave because they feel unsafe in the Lorengau community to where they are being coerced to move. The accommodation they have been told to move to remains unfinished and uninhabitable, independent observers say.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island police begin destroying shelters housing refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation inside the detention centre is a &quot; humanitarian emergency &quot;, the UN's refugee agency has said, for which Australia holds responsibility. The agency has urged both PNG and Australia to find a &quot;humane approach&quot; to end the &quot; unconscionable human suffering &quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement on Sunday, PNG's immigration minister, Petrus Thomas, told refugees and asylum seekers still in the centre they must leave by Monday &quot;so that they can have access to basic necessities such as food, water, medical care and security and that the work on decommissioning of the facility ... can be completed for the PNG defence force to take complete control of their land and property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG authorities have, thus far, refrained from using force in their efforts to move people on. They have entered the camp to destroy shelters and remove bins in which drinking water was being stored but they have not tried to forcibly evict anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it has not been ruled out if men remain in the camp beyond Monday's deadline. Previous confrontations, in 2014, 2015 and this year, have led to riots and the centre being invaded: refugees have been murdered, shot and attacked with machetes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days more than 100 men have voluntarily left the centre for the new accommodation. Several of those have tried to return but are being prevented from leaving the new camps by PNG immigration. The new centres are off limits to observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A legal challenge to have the PNG government restore essential services to the original detention centre, on the grounds their removal breached the constitutional rights of those inside, was rejected last week. But an appeal will be heard in the PNG supreme court on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer Ben Lomai, who is bringing the case on behalf of Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian refugee inside the camp, said the the proposed takeover of the detention centre brought with it the risk of extreme violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The safety of both the refugees and government workers plus staff of leading agencies is not to be taken for granted given the tension that is now being expressed by the locals on Manus Island,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current situation at the MRPC and on Manus Island is now totally out of control and fears of a looming 'bloodbath' are mounting by the day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the standoff on the island continues, the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has condemned Australia's handling of the situation as &quot;unacceptable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand has had on the table for several years an offer to take 150 refugees from Australian-run offshore detention centres each year. Australia has consistently rejected the offer, saying it represents a &quot;back door&quot; to Australia, something it will not abide. Australia's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, most recently refused it earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ardern, who previously reiterated NZ's offer, criticised Australia's unyielding stance on Sunday. &quot;We made the offer because we saw a great need,&quot; she said. &quot;No matter what label you put on it there is absolute need and there is harm being done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus island camp is a landscape of surreal horror | Behrouz Boochani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see the human face of this issue. I see the need and the role New Zealand needs to play. I think it's clear that we don't think what's happening there is acceptable, that's why the offer is there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having already made the offer to Turnbull in person, Ardern said she would again raise the issue with him when they meet this week in the Philippines - on the sidelines of the Asean summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees held on the island have asked why Australia is refusing to allow New Zealand to deal directly with PNG in resettling the men if, as Australia claims, the issue of the men's resettlement, is a &quot;matter for the government of PNG&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia does not have the right to reject New Zealand's offer,&quot; Boochani said. &quot;We don't want to go to Australia, let us go to NZ. Stop keeping political hostages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia pays for and maintains effective control of the PNG detention centre, according to the UN, apex courts in both countries and independent observers. There remains a significant Australian Border Force presence on Manus Island, and Australian officials have the ultimate authority on critical issues such as medical transfers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence cooperation with Sweden, a cyber security agreement with Germany, quota migrants and the trial of an Estonian businessman in Russia were among the main topics discussed by the Estonian media between 12 and 18 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estonian Defence Minister Juri Luik has said that Aurora 17, Sweden's largest military drill in 23 years, shows that Stockholm clearly understands its important role in ensuring the Baltic region's security. Luik met Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist and the commander of the Swedish Armed Forces, Gen Micael Byden, to discuss the situation in the region, Aurora 17, Zapad 2017 and bilateral military cooperation. Luik also met ambassadors of the EU and Nato member states in Sweden to give them an overview of the recent EU defence ministers' meeting in Tallinn. According to the secretary-general of the Swedish Defence Ministry, Jan Salestrand, Stockholm supports stronger defence cooperation within Europe, provided the efforts do not duplicate Nato's activities. (ERR website, in Estonian, 15 Sep 17)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Estonian Defence and Security Industry Innovation Cluster has signed a cooperation agreement with the Cyber-Security Council Germany to promote cooperation in the cyber security area. The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the DSEI 2017 fair in London by Ingvar Parnamae, head of the Estonian Defence and Security Industry Innovation Cluster, and Philipp von Saldern, president of the Cyber-Security Council Germany. Parnamae praised the deal, saying that it will help to strengthen cooperation between different sectors and companies. He noted that Estonia and Germany are willing to unify existing standards in the cyber area and to develop completely new standards to support a sustainable global economic body for cyber defence. Von Saldern, for his part, praised Estonia's know-how in the area of cyber security. (Delfi website, in Estonian, 12 Sep 17)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Estonian Refugee Council NGO plans to open a support centre for migrants in Tallinn on 15 September. The centre will be organising workshops, language clubs, film screenings and other events. It will also open two hotlines, with information available in the Estonian, English, Russian and Arabic languages. According to the head of the NGO, Eero Janson, the support centre is another step towards creating a system that facilitates the integration of refugees. (Aripaev website, in Estonian, 15 Sep 17)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tallinn has not been receiving files from the Greek authorities on so-called quota migrants since May, which means that no additional refugees are to be sent to Estonia under the EU migrant distribution plan anytime soon. &quot;We do not know whether and when Greece will continue the relocation of refugees,&quot; Liana Roosmaa, deputy director of the Citizenship and Migration Policy Department of the Interior Ministry, told the BNS news agency. She stressed that the relocation process takes about two months from the moment Estonia sends a request for files. Only two quota refugee families have arrived in Estonia in the past four months. Meanwhile, Estonian officials have also carried out proceedings in Turkey for relocating refugees to the country. &quot;At present, no-one is to arrive from Turkey anytime soon,&quot; Roosmaa said. She added that a mission was sent to Turkey this summer, but some refugees did not want to come to Estonia and others did not qualify for relocation. (ERR website, in Estonian, 15 Sep 17)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estonia will continue to accept quota migrants in the same way and at the same pace as before, Interior Minister Andres Anvelt has said, commenting on the fact that just two refugee families had arrived in Estonia in four months. &quot;Estonia has no problems with respecting its commitments,&quot; he stressed. Anvelt added that the most important thing for Tallinn is to guarantee public order and safety. The minister recalled that Estonia was one of the first countries in Europe to introduce a rule that representatives of the accepting country carry out their own interviews with candidates. &quot;At the same time, we need to keep in mind that Estonia is a democratic state ruled by law. We will not bring here anyone against their will. Those who want to come to Estonia will come,&quot; Anvelt said. &quot;Once the files are sent to us, we will see whether these people are suitable for us to accept them and whether they want to come to Estonia,&quot; the minister concluded. (ERR website, 18 Sep 17)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of Estonian businessman Raivo Susi, who was detained at a Moscow airport in February 2016 on suspicion of spying, is expected to begin in October or November. The preliminary court hearing in August ended with a somewhat surprising outcome as the court sent the materials back to the prosecutor's office, Susi's lawyer Arkady Tolpegin has told Postimees. He added that the investigators did not present to the suspect a copy of the indictment in Estonian. The Russian Criminal Code grants defendants the right to read the materials of their case in their native language, as well as to speak in court in their native language and use the services of an interpreter for free. Susi flatly denies any involvement in spying. (Postimees website, in Estonian, 13 Sep 17)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the shadow of the towering stands of Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion just up the road, 16 refugees from around the world are engaged in a frenetic game of football. After a particularly heavy challenge, Shamil Ilqasim, a 19-year-old Yazidi from northern Iraq, limps to the sideline with a beaming smile across his face. &quot;I've just hurt my leg but I'll be back on soon, don't worry,&quot; Shamil, who is wearing a Dortmund shirt and shorts combined with Hertha Berlin socks, assures me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is part of the Welcome to Football initiative that was instigated by the German Football League (DFL) in September 2015 and has led to 24 of the country's professional clubs running similar schemes to this one. In conjunction with the local amateur side TSC Eintracht Dortmund and with funding from the DFL and the German Children and Youth Foundation, the Bundesliga club's BVB Foundation has helped to create a project that is now in its third year and allows a group of refugees aged between 18 and 20 to attend a weekly training session at TSC's stadium, where they also receive a free meal beforehand and a German lesson afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Peter St&ouml;ger leaves with his head held high at crucial juncture for Cologne | Andy Brassell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really enjoyable,&quot; says Shamil. &quot;We play every week, we eat here and we have everything provided. I'm here with my family but it is more important for those who don't have any family. It makes us forget some of our problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to play football in Iraq but in 2014 Isis came to my country and it was very hard because my best friend ... Kalashnikov,&quot; he adds, his voice trailing away. &quot;It was very difficult for me. I still remember my friend but I feel like Germany is my home now. When I arrived here, because I didn't speak any of the language it was hard. But now things are getting better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students from refugee communities attending local schools are rewarded for good behaviour with a year-long place on the course, with organisers also helping to find them jobs and university places afterwards. As well as providing coaching and equipment, Dortmund continue to give away free tickets for their matches after famously inviting 220 refugees to a match in 2015, a number that was reported to have outstripped the total number of Syrians given asylum by the UK in the 18 previous months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three years ago, many refugees arrived in the city and we wanted to support them and the volunteers,&quot; explains Thomas Klein, from Borussia Dortmund's corporate social responsibility department. &quot;But as well as giving away tickets, we wanted to support something sustainable and were very glad when we heard about the idea from the DFL. It allowed us to create possibilities for the refugees to integrate into German culture and the community. We are very glad when a refugee comes to us and says, 'Sorry I can't come to training any more because I have a job'. That's a great situation. We want to help the people who want to stay in Germany and integrate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the launch of the campaign in 2015, several other Bundesliga sides have implemented similar initiatives, including Werder Bremen's &quot;Stay on the Ball&quot; project and Bayer Leverkusen's &quot;Bayer 04 does school&quot; - where the focus is on helping refugee children take steps to join a local club. Around 65 training sessions involving around 800 refugees aged between four and 30 take place in Germany every week, with as many as 600 having gone on to play in local amateur leagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfgang Euteneuer, a former professional for VfL Bochum who now runs the Welcome to Dortmund charity that provides support to refugees in the city, believes the support of professional clubs has been hugely beneficial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In one case, BVB helped a young boy who was being sent back to Kosovo,&quot; he recalls. &quot;In his appeal, they wrote that he is always here playing football and learning German. When we went to his hearing in D&uuml;sseldorf, this paper helped persuade them to allow him to stay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali El-Kadri arrived in Germany in 2015 after fleeing his town just outside Damascus in Syria. It took him several months of travelling on his own via Turkey, Greece and Serbia using whatever means necessary to reach Dortmund. Now 19, he plans to go to university next year and has been using the opportunity to brush up on his football and language skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to play in Syrian Under-17s team back home,&quot; he says. &quot;I love football and am always trying to get better so hopefully one day I can play for a big club like BVB. It was very hard to come here without my parents and learn a new language and a new culture. But this project has helped me improve my knowledge of German and make some new friends. That is important because you need to have a high level of German to be able to go to university. Playing football gives me the inspiration to do well in the rest of my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the training session draws to a close, the group head indoors to a classroom for their hour-long German lesson. With most having already spent the morning working or at college, it is a long day but there is no lack of enthusiasm when the conversation turns to the previous evening's 2-2 draw between Germany and France in nearby Cologne. Most admit they will be supporting reigning champions Die Mannschaft at the World Cup in Russia next year, although there are a few who clearly have a soft spot for England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present, only a handful of clubs in the Premier League such as Arsenal, Everton and Leicester are running regular projects for refugees, while the Football Association donated several free tickets to some for England's draws with Germanyand Brazil at Wembley last month. But after the success of Football Welcomes, a weekend of activities held in April, Naomi Westland from Amnesty International is hoping many more will now follow Germany's example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to see football clubs working with other organisations in their communities to support and welcome refugees,&quot; she says. &quot;They play a really important role in integration and social cohesion in their communities and people listen to what they say. This is a really good model to show how that partnership can work. At a time when police reports show a rise in xenophobia and hate crimes it seems to be more important than it has ever been. We want people to feel welcome when they arrive in a new country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every player is presented with a bright yellow Dortmund training top at the end of the class before they begin to make their way home, but not before the final word from their coach and mentor Hassan Al Moula, whose family moved to Germany from Lebanon to escape the civil war in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very important to learn respect and fair play because that's vital if you want to stay in Germany,&quot; he says passionately. &quot;You can make a mistake in society but you have to set a good example and try to integrate. Rules on the pitch are important rules in life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This coming week could prove pivotal for the crisis as Bangladeshi authorities struggle to get the refugee situation under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 410,000 people from the Rohingya minority Muslim group have now crossed the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Suu Kyi's image as a human rights campaigner has been tarnished after she failed to intervene in the crackdown which started on August 25, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar launched operations in Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military says its &quot;clearance operations&quot; in the area are aimed at flushing out Rohingya militants who attacked police posts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence has since engulfed the border region, with reports emerging of Rohingya villages being razed to the ground and civilians being cut down as they attempt to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has branded the offensive a &quot;textbook example of ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ms Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has expressed no public concern for the Rohingya, instead blaming &quot;terrorists&quot; for the violence and criticising &quot;a huge iceberg of misinformation&quot;. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actor and humanitarian campaigner Angelina Jolie on Sunday condemned the conflict and criticised the Burmese army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's absolutely clear that the violence by the army needs to stop and that the return of the refugees has to be permitted - and that the Rohingya should be given civil rights,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;We all wish that Aung San Suu Kyi will in this situation be the voice of human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Suu Kyi's party took office last year as Myanmar's first civilian-led government after 50 years of junta rule. But she has no power to control the army, which retains sweeping powers and controls the police force and the border force.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's signalling that her chief priority is the relationship between the government and military and that the pogrom is secondary to that,&quot; Francis Wade, author of 'Myanmar's Enemy Within' said of the position Ms Suu Kyi has taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar's army chief, has called for a &quot;united&quot; stance in handling the crisis but gave no sign of concessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Myanmar's government hinted that it may not take back Rohingya who fled across the border, accusing those refugees of having links to the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who fled the villages made their way to the other country for fear of being arrested as they got involved in the violent attacks. Legal protection will be given to the villages whose residents did not flee,&quot; the government's Information Committee statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts are not expecting Ms Suu Kyi to change her position in tomorrow's speech, which has to address the crisis without angering the military.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Depressingly, her silence about the Rohingya makes her far more popular at home,&quot; veteran journalist John Simpson wrote in an article for the Daily Telegraph .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is little or no sympathy for them among ethnic Burmese, mostly Buddhists, who form the great majority of the country's population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend Bangladeshi authorities told newly arrived Rohingya refugees that they must stay near the border - not move further into the country - and reminded Bangaldeshi people they were not to rent housing to refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came as aid agencies warned Sunday that Rohingyas fleeing the violence could die of starvation, exposure and dehydration as authorities began moving people to camps in order to streamline the distribution of help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people are arriving hungry, exhausted and with no food or water,&quot; Mark Pierce, Bangladesh country director for the Save the Children aid agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Children 'burned alive' say Rohingya refugees       01:48</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm particularly worried that the demand for food, shelter, water and basic hygiene support is not being met due to the sheer number of people in need. If families can't meet their basic needs, the suffering will get even worse and lives could be lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scrabble for aid has become deadly. On Saturday, it was confirmed that two children and a woman died in a stampede to get aid in Cox's Bazar district, which is home to tens of thousands of Rohingyas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To add extra misery, heavy monsoon rain Sunday descended upon hundreds of thousands of people stuck in makeshift camps, with many refugees living on roadsides under flimsy plastic sheets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Torrential rain brought swamp-like conditions to many parts of Cox's Bazar, with about three inches of rain falling in 24 hours and with more to come over the next two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rain &quot;has doubled their misery&quot;, said Mohammed Kai-Kislu, police chief at Ukhia near Cox's Bazar, and refugees have resorted to building bamboo &quot;carpets&quot; to get over flooded land as the mudbath spreads.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burmese military has been accused of using land mines to target ethnic Rohingya refugees fleeing mass killings after two people were injured in blasts near the country's border with Bangladesh.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports came as Bangladesh's government accused Burmese authorities of  slaughtering at least 3000 people in a campaign of &quot;genocide&quot; against the country's Muslim Rohingya minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The international community is saying it is a genocide. We also say it is a genocide,&quot; A.H. Mahmood Ali, the foreign minister of Bangladesh, said after meeting with Arab and Western diplomats and UN agencies in Dhaka.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mahmoud said about 300,000 Rohingya refugees have entered Bangladesh since the Burmese military launched an operation against insurgents in the country's Rakhine state on August 25.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                             Roland Oliphant: The scale of the Rohingya crisis 'is mindblowing'                         00:56</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two diplomats present at the meeting said Mr Ali estimated 3000 Rohingya have been killed since.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks on Burmese border posts last month, called a unilateral ceasefire on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement posted on its Twitter account, the group said would halt &quot;offensive military operations&quot; for one month to allow humanitarian actors access to the region. It urged the Burmese military to do the same.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma, which has previously labelled ARSA as &quot;terrorists&quot;, appeared to reject the overture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no policy to negotiate with terrorists,&quot; Zaw Htay, a senior government spokesman, tweeted late on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came as further evidence emerged that Burma is laying land mines on the border near known refugee crossing point.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man lost his foot and another was rushed to hospital in Cox's Bazar with serious injuries on Sunday after standing on land mines near known crossing points used by refugees, Amnesty International said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees camped in a narrow stretch of no-man's-land between the Burmese and Bangladeshi frontier on Sunday told the Telegraph one person had been seriously injured and two suffered minor wounds by land mines in recent days.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaiser, a 10 year old boy at the camp on the banks of the Tombro Khal river, needed stitches in his forehead after being hit by flying shrapnel when another refugee stepped on a mine laid on a path five days earlier.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was on the path and there was just a loud bang. Luckily I got just a spark from it,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't see what happened to the man who stepped on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another incident earlier this month reported by Amnesty&nbsp;a woman in her 50s crossed the border from Bangladesh into Taung Pyo Let Wal and stepped on a landmine on the way back. She is being treated in a Bangladeshi hospital after her leg was blown off from the knee down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of her relatives, Kalma, 20, said: &quot;My mother-in-law went to our village [from the camp] to fetch water to take a shower. A few minutes later I heard a big explosion and I heard someone had stepped on a mine. It was only later I realised it was my mother-in-law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh said last week it had fully opened its borders to Rohingya fleeing the violence.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, refugees on the Tombro Khal said they have been prevented from entering the country by Bangladeshi border guards, effectively trapping them inside Burma between the minefield and the river.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They let us cross to get water and shop in the bazar individually, but they will not let us cross in family groups,&quot; said a 21-year-old mother, who said she was raped by a senior Burmese police officer when her village of Boli Baar was burnt down in August. &quot;The border guards stop us. They won't let us come in, but we want to. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the International Organisation for Migration, the main UN agency coordinating a response in the Cox's Bazar area, said the flow of refugees showed no sign of slowing and that UN, Bangladeshi government, and international aid agencies on the ground are struggling to cope.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is beyond critical now. I cannot think of another situation where 300,000 people have crossed a border in such a short period of time,&quot; said Peppi Siddiq of IOM Bangladesh.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we don't have some pretty large scale support soon internationally we are going to be trying to apply a band-aid to a bullet wound,&quot; she added.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malcolm Turnbull has said the US-Australia refugee swap was always subject to US security vetting as he defended telling Donald Trump the US could decide not to take any refugees in a leak of their first conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian prime minister described the conversation, leaked in a transcript to the Washington Post, with the US president as courteous and frank and he again thanked Trump for honouring the refugee deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the transcript, the contents of which have not been denied by the Coalition government, shows Turnbull told Trump that the US did not have to settle any of the asylum seekers, given it would go through its own vetting process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has always been subject to American vetting procedures,&quot; Turnbull said on Friday. &quot;That's always been part of the arrangement and the procedures of department of homeland security are ongoing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull refused to say what would happen to those refused by the US, saying he was focussed on resettling refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an arrangement with the United States and we are looking forward to that vetting process being completed,&quot; Turnbull said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Australians can see I stand up for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the phone call, Turnbull also told Trump the deal was for Australia to take people the Obama administration were &quot;very keen on getting out of the United States&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will take more,&quot; Turnbull said in the call. &quot;We will take anyone that you want us to take. The only people that we do not take are people who come by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we would rather take a not very attractive guy that helps you out than take a Nobel peace prize winner that comes by boat. That is the point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Turnbull said Australia had agreed to work with the US in resettling some South American refugees but would not go into details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he defended the Coalition's decision to include 90% of Christians in the one-off 12,000 intake of Syrian refugees announced by Tony Abbott just prior to losing the leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[The intake] was focussed on and avowedly so, quite openly focussed on persecuted minorities and the bulk of those are in fact Christians because they are also Yazidis, also Muslims but the majority are in fact Muslims.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extraordinary transcript leaked to the Washington Post relates to the first phone call between the leaders on 28 January. Just days after the call, details of what had been said were also leaked to the Washington Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Turnbull refused to comment on the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josh Frydenberg rejected the suggestion that the transcript showed a lack of compassion for asylum seekers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an issue here in Australia that we came to government to solve, which was the fact that we saw 50,000 unauthorised boat arrivals,&quot; Frydenberg, who is the federal energy minister, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prime minister reiterated in that phone call to the president, that our principal strategy here is to deny those evil people-smugglers a product to sell. That's why these people are not being settled in Australia and it is working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they get to settle in the United States, then they will have a better life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  What we've learned from the Trump-Turnbull call transcript</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd described the call between the two leaders as &quot;right out there&quot;, saying it would cause a large domestic political problem for Turnbull. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudd said Turnbull's description of himself as &quot;a highly transactional businessman&quot; would go down like a &quot;lead balloon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To say, hey look, we just want to be seen to be doing a deal with you guys - you don't actually have to take any of these asylum seekers or refugees - and then as part of the swap... we'll take anybody that you want to send to us,&quot; Rudd told CNN. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Turnbull now faces through this extraordinary leak from the United States, a very large-scale domestic political problem concerning his own credibility and his tenuous hold on the conservative party leadership in Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Full transcript of Trump's phone call with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudd said the US-Australian alliance would survive the leak but it was more troublesome for Turnbull.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the real unfolding dynamic from this extraordinary conversation is prime minister Turnbull having been loose with the truth with his dealings with the Australian people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Frydenberg said the transcript showed that Turnbull had stood up for the deal signed with Barack Obama in 2016, under which the US agreed to take up to 2,000 asylum seekers currently in offshore detention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He stood up for the deal that he had agreed with the Obama administration and he made that point very forcefully as we already knew with that conversation with the president,&quot; Frydenberg told Sky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And quite clearly that is what we expect of our prime minister and that is what he has done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Turnbull government announced the deal in November last year, he declined to say what would happen to refugees who did not get accepted in the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the phone call, Turnbull told Trump: &quot;Every individual is subject to your vetting. You can decide to take them or to not take them after vetting. You can decide to take 1,000 or 100. It is entirely up to you. The obligation is to only go through the process.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor senator Murray Watt accused the Coalition of lying when they said the US would take all the refugees in offshore detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So every time Turnbull &amp; Dutton have said US will take 1,250 refugees, they were lying. https://t.co/I9Kaua0Upd - Senator Murray Watt (@MurrayWatt) August 3, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Turnbull described Australia's policy to refuse any refugee who came by boat, Trump said: &quot;That is a good idea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should do that too. You are worse than I am.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens leader Richard Di Natale said it was time for a radical change of approach if Trump considered Australia worse than his own administration on immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's now obvious that Malcolm Turnbull is more worried about his own political survival than the lives of innocent people,&quot; Di Natale said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lack of empathy or compassion for people who are suffering and the callous disregard for their fate is deeply shocking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 50 refugees and asylum seekers held on Nauru - including at least three women seeking to terminate a pregnancy - are being refused, or not considered for, overseas medical treatment, in defiance of doctors' recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three pregnant refugee women on Nauru have asked to terminate their pregnancies, for cultural, familial and health reasons. Doctors' requests for them to be transferred overseas for the procedure have been rejected. Terminations are illegal on Nauru, a devoutly Christian country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Australian immigration department staff have confirmed to the Guardian that nearly 50 refugees and asylum seekers are on a waiting list for approval for medical transfer for a variety of conditions including musculoskeletal injuries and surgeries that cannot be performed on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia's offshore detention centres 'terrible', says architect of system</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since July this year, Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection has mandated that all medical transfers must be approved by the Nauru hospital overseas medical referral committee. Previously, urgent or sensitive medical transfers were directly arranged between the Australian Border Force and the Australian government's health contractor, International Health and Medical Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff on the island say the changed procedure is a political effort to obstruct medical transfers. The OMR committee meets irregularly, keeps little paperwork, repeatedly defers decisions and often cancels meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But island sources say, as well, the OMR committee has been placed in an invidious position in the case of terminations, essentially being asked to sign off a procedure overseas that is illegal in Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three pregnant women have been recommended by doctors for transfer overseas for terminations this month but have been refused by the hospital OMR committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In at least one case, a psychiatrist has recommended a woman's &quot;mental health was being significantly impacted upon by her current situation and that if the termination of pregnancy does not proceed it will very likely pose a significant risk to her physical and mental health, both from an individual, familial and community perspective&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politically, there is resistance from the Australian government to refugees and asylum seekers being brought to Australia for tertiary care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees and asylum seekers brought to Australia for medical treatment often exercise their rights before the courts, and seek injunctions preventing them from being returned. These are regularly granted by Australian courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2015 it has been Australian government policy that asylum seekers and refugees deliver babies on Nauru because of their &quot; propensity &quot; - in the government's words - to exercise those legal rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A staff member on Nauru told the Guardian there was no reason - beyond political obstruction - to give the Nauru hospital OMR committee final authority over the transfer of asylum seekers and refugees to other countries for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the past, some women who went to Australia for terminations sought injunctions and are now living in community detention in Australia. Some others declined the termination once they reached Australia, secured an injunction and have since given birth to their child. Not all women did this, some returned to Nauru after their termination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Australian Border Force needed another step in the process, to prevent women from travelling to Australia. Now that requests for terminations must be submitted to the OMR committee, it is guaranteed that approval will not be given. Women are being denied the right to end their pregnancy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff member said medical professionals on the island held deep concerns for the wellbeing of the pregnant women, and for anyone else who sought a termination in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These women already have significant mental health problems. Giving birth and raising a child in Nauru would only increase their mental health burden. I am concerned that these women will self-harm, attempt suicide, or attempt a home abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'It's time to act': Liberal MP calls for Australia to take refugees from Manus and Nauru</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the women is now 15 weeks pregnant. For this woman, there is only five weeks left in which to end her pregnancy. This current policy ... denies women the right to end their pregnancy. If things do not change, these women will unwillingly become mothers, if they do not kill themselves first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff member said the instruction to involve the Nauru hospital OMR committee in referral decisions was politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Terminations should be managed between IHMS and ABF. There is no reason to include the OMR committee and the Republic of Nauru hospital, other than to enforce Australia's current policy that anyone who arrives by boat will not be settled in Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nauru - a country of 10,000 people - has limited medical facilities and only one small hospital, recently upgraded with $12m of Australian aid money. Nauruan women facing complex deliveries are regularly flown to Australia, Fiji or Singapore to give birth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Paddy McLisky from Doctors for Refugees said the Australian immigration department had deliberately created a cumbersome, complex, and bureaucratic process for medical transfers, that appeared as though it was designed to fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The epitome of this is referring termination of pregnancy to the OMR committee, when that procedure is illegal in Nauru. The committee is being put in an impossible position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was completely forseeable that this process would create a frightening and potentially dangerous situation for women seeking termination of pregnancy.&quot; McLisky said the patients' best interests were not being considered in sending termination referrals to the OMR, where they were almost certain to be rejected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Going through a termination of pregnancy is one of the most difficult situations of a woman's life. It's an incredibly difficult decision to make, and to have this referred off to a committee to decide, to have it discussed and evaluated by bureaucrats, security and travel staff, when it is something many people would prefer to keep quiet, is just inhumane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is yet another example of medical care which is clearly not 'broadly comparable' with health services available in the Australian community, where abortion in early pregnancy is widely permitted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Border force doctor knew of Manus asylum seeker's deteriorating health before death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian put a series of questions regarding medical transfers to the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection's media unit. A spokesman in response said: &quot;these are matters for authorities in Nauru&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repeated calls to the Nauru government and Nauru hospital were not returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian immigration department has consistently maintained that refugees held offshore enjoy access to healthcare &quot; broadly comparable &quot; to that in the Australian community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's handling of pregnancies among the refugee and asylum seeker community on Nauru has often been controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, a Kuwaiti refugee facing a complex birth was flown from Nauru to Australia late in her pregnancy after intense lobbying from doctors arguing that she faced a potential life-threatening delivery on Nauru. Five obstetricians in Australia, including the president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Michael Gannon, reviewed her case and said she should be immediately moved to a hospital with appropriate neonatal facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year a Somali refugee and her newborn infant were medically evacuated from Nauru in a critical condition and placed on life support in a Brisbane hospital after she gave birth by caesarean on the island one month prematurely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in 2015, a government health contractor advertised on LinkedIn for a neonatologist to fly the very next day to Nauru to oversee a complex birth. The ad even invited doctors to nominate their salary for a week's work. Doctors told the government the mother should be flown, with the baby in utero, to a tertiary hospital. The woman ultimately gave birth on Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's policy around babies born to refugee women has led to an unusual legal sophistry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babies born in Australia to women moved from offshore detention are regarded by the department as &quot;illegal maritime arrivals&quot; to the country, despite having never been on a boat nor having left Australia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most people I talked to walked for eight to ten days to get to the border,&quot; Olivia Headon, a press officer for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), said Friday, adding: &quot;They had nothing to eat or drink after the first few days.&quot;<BR><BR>Fleeing the violence which has convulsed their communities in Myanmar's Northern Rakhine state since late August, these latest arrivals, after waiting for low tide in the paddy fields near the border, join over 820,000 Rohingya refugees already living in some safety in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar, where over 607,320 have arrived since 25 August.<BR><BR>Ms. Headon said the new arrivals expressed their desire to find family members who had already crossed into Bangladesh. Several explained they had hoped to leave Myanmar sooner, but had to wait to harvest and sell their grain to raise funds for their journey, she explained. &quot;One man told me he had to pay someone to carry his elderly mother.&quot;<BR><BR>Meanwhile, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), and partners have distributed tokens, direct food supplies, and offered medical care for those at the Anjuman Para border crossing.<BR><BR>A reception area at Balukhali in the Bangladeshi city of Cox's Bazar, run by the IOM, is providing emergency assistance and self-settlement kits to improve living condition for the new arrivals.<BR><BR>UNHCR is also scaling up relief efforts to cope with the new influx of refugees around Kutupalong camp near Cox's Bazar.<BR><BR>&quot;More than 2,000 of them have moved towards UNHCR's transit centre near Kutupalong camp, including some vulnerable refugees who were taken by bus,&quot; Babar Baloch, UNHCR spokesperson told reporters at the regular press briefing in Geneva.<BR><BR>He added that this &quot;comes as our staff just relocated over 400 recent arrivals to a new extension to Kutupalong camp.&quot;<BR><BR>In related news, preliminary data from a nutrition assessment conducted last week at Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar shows a 7.5 per cent prevalence of life-threatening severe acute malnutrition - a rate double that seen among Rohingya child refugees in May 2017, UNICEF said.<BR><BR>&quot;The Rohingya children in the camp - who have survived horrors in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state and a dangerous journey here - are to already caught up in a catastrophe,&quot; said UNICEF Bangladesh Representative Edouard Beigbeder. &quot;Those with severe malnutrition are now at risk of dying from an entirely preventable and treatable cause.&quot;<BR><BR>UNICEF and partners are treating over 2,000 acutely malnourished children at 15 treatment centres, with six additional centres currently being set up. The agency is also working with health partners to identify and treat diarrhoea and pneumonia, and will be conducting mass vaccination and nutrition screening campaigns this month.<BR><BR>&quot;The humanitarian community needs to be able to do far more to treat and protect these extremely vulnerable children,&quot; Mr. Beigbeder said. &quot;For that we need far more attention to the crisis, and far more resources for the response.

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis finally used the word 'Rohingya' during his current trip to Asia after&nbsp;assiduously avoiding it only days earlier in Myanmar.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during an interfaith meeting in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka the Pope asked for forgiveness from Rohingya refugees for all the hurt and indifference they have endured, demanded their rights be recognized</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The presence of God today is also called Rohingya,' he said in an improvised remark after meeting 16 refugees brought to the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka from their camps in Cox's Bazar near the border with Myanmar.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a deeply moving encounter, Francis greeted and blessed a group of Rohingya Muslim refugees, grasping their hands and listening to their stories in a show of public solidarity over Asia's worst refugee crisis in decades.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He apologized for the 'indifference of the world' to their plight and then pronounced the name of their ethnic group to a gathering of Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and Christian leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 16 Rohingya - 12 men, two women and two young girls - had traveled to Dhaka from Cox's Bazar, the district bordering Myanmar where refugee camps are overflowing with more than 620,000 Rohingya who have fled what the U.N. says is a campaign of ethnic cleansing by Myanmar's military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign has included the burning of Rohingya villages and fleeing Rohingya have described arson, rape and shootings by Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist mobs that left them no option but to make the dangerous and sometimes deadly journey through jungles and by sea to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Myanmar government has denied any such campaign is underway. The army says 'clearance operations' are targeting militants who attacked security positions in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar's government and most of the Buddhist majority recoil from the term 'Rohingya,' saying the members of the Muslim minority are 'Bengalis' who migrated illegally from Bangladesh. Myanmar doesn't acknowledge them as a local ethnic group and won't give them citizenship, even though they have lived in Myanmar for generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one, each one of the refugees approached the pope at the end of Friday's event in the tented garden of the Dhaka archbishop's residence. Francis blessed one little girl, placing his hand on her head, and grasped the shoulder of a young man. The women who approached him pushed aside their headscarves so they could speak, offering their hands out for him to hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Maybe we can't do much for you, but your tragedy has a place in our hearts,' Francis said. 'For those who have hurt you, and above all the indifference of the world, I ask your forgiveness.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for continued advocacy 'so that their rights are recognized.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis had refrained from publicly raising the crisis or using the word Rohingya while in Myanmar out of diplomatic deference to his hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights organizations and Rohingya themselves had voiced disappointment at Francis' public silence in Myanmar, given he had previously denounced the persecution of 'our Rohingya brothers and sisters.' The Vatican defended it as diplomatically necessary, and stressed that his silence in public didn't negate what he had said in the past, or what he was saying in private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis' encounter with the refugees was the highlight of his day that began with a Mass to ordain 16 new priests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh's tiny Catholic community represents a fraction of 1 percent of the majority Muslim population of 160 million. Despite its small size, the Catholic Church runs a network of schools, orphanages and clinics and has enjoyed relative freedom in its work, though Christian missionaries say they have received letters threatening dire consequences if they continue to spread Christianity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his homily ordaining 16 new priests, Francis thanked those who came out for the Mass, noting that some people had traveled two days to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Thank you for your generosity,' Francis said. 'This indicates the love that you have for the church.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucked away on a busy street in the heart of Athens, the door to the Melissa Network is always open. Today the women's refuge is buzzing with activity. Recently arrived refugee women are being taught how to code, speak Greek, develop leadership skills - and even how to decipher fake news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one room students sit around a table speaking passionately in a symphony of languages: Greek, Arabic and English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a class on women's rights,&quot; says Andrea Borja, who works there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-for-profit opened in July 2016 and has become a home away from home for women from the Middle East and Africa. Most of the women here have made difficult journeys from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia and a host of other countries. Melissa is known as one of the few organisations in Athens catering specifically to refugee women. It's also run by women who came to the Greek capital as migrants themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us, integration and empowerment had to be the focus,&quot; says Nadina Christopoulou - a Greek anthropologist and co-founder of Melissa Foundation. She hesitates before adding: &quot;We see a high rate of divorce here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melissa means &quot;honey bee&quot; in Greek, says Christopoulou. In beehives, the worker bees are always female so the name is a metaphor for women's empowerment. Few organisations in Athens have the resources to address sexual and gender-based violence that can affect female refugees, Christopoulou adds. As a result, victims are failing to receive the support they need when they arrive in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see women coming in here with broken wings. They have faced so many challenges. But within the span of one or two weeks here you start to see new personalities emerging,&quot; the organisation co-founder says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopoulou says many Melissa members who attend the centre's women's rights classes are shocked to learn that some of the experiences they have endured - in particular, sexual violence and physical abuse - have been in violation of their own rights. Many, she adds, end up wanting to take cases of abuse to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Around the world, at least one in every three women has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime,&quot; the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees has said in a report. &quot;Refugees and internally displaced people who do not enjoy the protection of their own governments, are among those most vulnerable to acts of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman, who fled violence in Laos and arrived in Athens almost exactly one year ago says Melissa has been a lifeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was terrible,&quot; she says. &quot;I came here by myself. I felt so afraid.&quot; A gynaecologist by training, she now helps provide care to other women who visit the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She had few contacts in Athens when she arrived and felt isolated after having to cut off contact with her own family Laos - but at Melissa, she's forged new connections and has been able to help women in the local community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here, I've met so many people. We are like a family,&quot; she says. A group of teenage girls chatting after a lunch the centre offers to all of its members say they couldn't agree more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sita, 14, and her older sister Gita, 17, met 14-year-old Fatima at Melissa six months ago. The girls lived in Iran where they were refugees from Afghanistan but were faced with barriers to education - and socialising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't have any friends, or relationships [in Iran],&quot; Fatima says through an interpreter. &quot;I was tailoring clothes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian authorities have made efforts in recent years to connect Afghan children with education, but many families continue to face obstacles that prevent their children from attending school, according to Human Rights Watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Athens, Fatima says she has been given a new chance to go to school and make friends through Melissa - an opportunity she says her parents are grateful for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gita and Sita say after making the difficult journey from Iran to Turkey by car and then travelling by boat from Turkey to the Greek Islands before finally arriving in Athens, they no longer care about where they are, as long as they are safe with their family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have different feelings,&quot; Gita says. &quot;My feeling is the same as when we decided to come to Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three girls, however, are optimistic about their future in Greece. Fatima says she wants to be an actor - and if that doesn't work out, she's also interested in becoming a nurse. Gita wants to own her own tailor shop, while Sita hopes to pursue her dreams as a singer. Melissa Network aims to encourage girls and women to pursue employment opportunities and follow their ambitions. The network itself employs more than 15 refugee women to help them gain work experience. It also runs regular CV workshops and helps to connect women with work in Athens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They come here with so many skills, talents and dreams and you can tap into all that as an organisation and as a society - but first, you have to provide the basics,&quot; says Christopoulou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the organisation is also going one step further by launching a new entrepreneurship programme to help refugee women start their own local businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian chef Maria Ohilebo, a co-founder of Melissa came to Greece more than 20 years ago. She cooks traditional lunch dishes for the women and girls every day. Ohilebo plans to open a pastry and cookery shop through the new entrepreneurship programme that will employ refugee women through Melissa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says the programme's success still depends on funding, but that she is optimistic. While Melissa does work closely with the Athens municipality, it does not rely on state support, which its organisers say allows it to be more &quot;independent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohilebo said there are opportunities for newcomers to Greece - but that they have to be patient - because often migrants want to flee to &quot;the big names like Canada or England&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe there are opportunities here and I believe the Greeks are beginning to open up more and are welcoming people,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 45,000 refugees and migrants are currently living in Greece, according to the UN - and that number continues to rise, with nearly 3,700 refugees having arrived in August alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melissa co-founders say they hope to see more services and support for the specific needs of refugee women hoping to build new lives in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have zero drop-out rates here. They only leave [Melissa Network] if they have to leave Athens. And the number keeps on growing higher,&quot; says Christopoulou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a challenge... but it's also something that makes us very happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANGELA Merkel's government has been called on to tighten housing and deportation rules for refugees following a deadly knife attack in Hamburg last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's policy on migrants could cost Angela Merkel her job</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shocking killing has reignited a political dispute over refugee policy in the country ahead of parliamentary elections in September, with Mrs Merkel hoping to secure a fourth term in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 26-year-old Palestinian man living in a city refugee home has been identified as the sole suspect in the Hamburg attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was awaiting deportation following a failed asylum application in December.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of migrants has long been a losing battle for the Merkel administration, since the country opened its borders more than two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association of towns and communities, which represents local German authorities, has called on Berlin officials to pay more attention to how failed asylum seekers are dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has also called for closer monitoring of those considered potentially dangerous, insisting that they should be kept under closer centralised supervision instead of being allowed to live in private housing or smaller refugee centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chancellor Angela Merkel is hoping for a fourth term in office in the September election</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerd Landsberg, the association's managing director, said: &quot;We believe that suspects under orders to leave the country should not live normally in the community or in [local] refugee homes, but in central facilities run by the regional authorities or by the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local authorities are of the view that those who are under orders to leave but do not depart, must be deported. That secures acceptance in the population for refugees who obtain rights to stay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centralised facilities advocated by the group would entail the use of larger, more security facilities, like army barracks, similar to those in Bamberg, Bavaria which currently serves as a holding centre for Balkan migrants ahead of their deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to German newspaper Bild, the issue of refugees is one of the biggest dangers to Mrs Merkel's political ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although laws on failed asylum seeks have been strengthened since the Berlin attack in December, Germans say not enough is being learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Berlin attack saw 12 people killed and 56 injured when another failed asylum seeker, Tunisian national Anis Amri, drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Hamburg suspect, Amri was known to the security services and although identified as a potentially dangerous Islamist, he not regarded as an imminent threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While new rules have made it easier for authorities to detain dangerous asylum seekers, whether or not they have been charged, their enforcement varies drastically from region to region, with a number of administrations reluctant to carry out deportations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives ministers within Mrs Merkel's party have demanded stronger action from the regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andreas Scheuer, general secretary of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, the CDU's ally, said: &quot;If people are known to have been radicalised, such persons must be removed from circulation and detained before they do the deed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamburg mayor Olaf Scholz lays flowers at scene of supermarket knife attack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the liberals have expressed wariness of the legal implications of punishing suspects not yet convicted of any offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boris Pistorius, the social democrat interior minister of the Lower Saxony region, described Mr Scheuer's calls as &quot;an attack on the principle of the rule of law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 24,000 failed asylum seekers were removed from Germany last year, with a further 54,000 leaving voluntarily, according to official data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of 2016, there were 207,000 migrants officially awaiting removal from Germany, with around 55,000 exhausting all possible appeals and procedures available to them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize will be announced in Oslo today: the coveted prize is given to a person, or group of people, who have &quot;done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations&quot;. The committee is said to receive more than 200 nominations a year, although only a select group of people - such as politicians, committee members, and peace prize laureates - are allowed to nominate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee has received some questionable nominations this year - both the US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are said to have been nominated - but various organisations have whittled them down to a more realistic list of front runners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topping the list is Pope Francis, who has been favoured to win since he became head of the Catholic church in 2013. No pontiff has ever won the prize, but Pope Francis has distinguished himself for his progressive viewpoints and strong statements on climate change and refugees. One British betting company told TIME that Francis received more bets than any other candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the committee is looking to reward work with refugees, they have several strong contenders. The UN Refugee Agency and High Commissioner Filippo Grandi are obvious nominees, given their work on the international refugee crisis. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who opened her country to more than one million refugees and migrants, is an outside contender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Peace Research Institute Oslo, which maintains a popular list of Peace Prize favourites, is betting on two architects of the Iran nuclear deal: Mohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister of Iran, and Federica Mogherini, a High Representative of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2015 agreement ended a 12-year international diplomatic crisis over Iran's nuclear weapons programme. After 20 months of deliberations, the country agreed to get rid of their uranium stockpile and allow international observers to oversee their nuclear programme. Awarding the peace prize to the deal's authors would reward these efforts while sending a strong message to Mr Trump, who is reportedly planning to decertify the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Committee is serious about reaching Mr Trump, however, The Guardian has suggested awarding the prize to the American Civil Liberties Union. The nonprofit advocacy group has mounted some of the most effective legal challenges to Mr Trump's policies since he took office, and have seen a surge in donations in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee may choose to target to another world leader, however, by awarding the prize to Turkish journalist Can D&uuml;ndar. The former editor of Turkey's Cumhuriyet newspaper, Mr D&uuml;ndar was convicted of espionage and aiding a terrorist group due to his groundbreaking reporting. He currently lives in exile in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen of Mr D&uuml;ndar's former Cumhuriyet co-workers have also been put on trial for aiding a terrorist organisation. Awarding the prize to Mr D&uuml;ndar, or Cumhuriyet as a whole, would be a strong rebuke of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo??an's media crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another journalist floated for the prize is Raif Badawi, a Saudi writer who was arrested in June 2012 for &quot;insulting Islam&quot; online and on television. He was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes, of which he has received 50. The award would send a similar message to the Saudi government about the importance of press freedoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rounding out list is one of last year's top contenders, the Syrian Civil Defence (better known as the White Hats). The group, nicknamed the for helmets they wear to protect themselves, rescues civilians in Syria from bombed-out buildings. They claim to have saved 99,000 people over course of the country's six-year civil war. While they were passed over for the prize last year, they've since had a poignant - and very convincing - documentary made about their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced at 10:00 BST today.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family of the Iranian asylum seeker Hamed Shamshiripour have formally requested his body be brought to Australia from Papua New Guinea for an autopsy, saying foul play could not be ruled out in his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamshiripour's body was found on Monday in forest near to the refugee transit centre on Manus Island where he was being held. The 31-year-old - whose acute and worsening mental health issues had been raised within the highest echelons of the Australian immigration department - had been missing since Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said Shamshiripour's death was suicide, but his family in Iran has demanded an urgent autopsy, following by an inquest in Australia to determine the cause, timing and circumstances of his death. They want an assurance his body is being kept in mortuary-like conditions, and have asked that it be returned to Iran after the autopsy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Border force doctor knew of Manus asylum seeker's deteriorating health before death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor George Newhouse from the National Justice Project, which is acting for the Shamshiripour family, said they sought only a transparent process to investigate their son's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hamed's declining health had been monitored by Border Force and was known to Comcover - I can understand why people are demanding that they be held responsible for the inaction that led to his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our leaders are implicated in Hamed's death. Government officials knew about his fragile condition and they left him there to die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is a paper trail in this case that must be followed and we will not rest ... the family want justice and they want those responsible to be held accountable even if that goes all the way to the prime minister and the minister for immigration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos are in circulation purportedly showing Shamshiripour's body when it was found. The Guardian has chosen not to publish these, and they are not conclusive about the circumstances of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photos show injuries that may have occurred before death. The position in which Shamshiripour's body was found has also raised questions about the circumstances of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island asylum seeker's friends begged Australia for help before his death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Papua New Guinea police commissioner, Gary Baki, told reporters Shamshiripour committed suicide, but refugees and detention centre staff on Manus Island have called for an autopsy, alleging Shamshiripour had regularly clashed with police and members of the public, and may have been attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police established a crime scene where Shamshiripour's body was found, by schoolchildren, on Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus Island police chief, David Yapu, said an autopsy would be conducted to determine Shamshiripour's cause of death, but there has been no detail on when, where and by whom that would be conducted. Yapu said he believed there was no evidence of foul play. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than a year, refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island, advocates in Australia, and mental health professionals working in the detention centre, repeatedly raised concerns about Shamshiripour's deteriorating mental health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His &quot;chaotic presentation&quot;, &quot;erratic and unpredictable behaviour&quot; and &quot;unstable state&quot; were the subject of repeated formal reports and informal pleas from health professionals during his time on Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamshiripour's case had also been reported in the media over several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief medical officer of the Australian Border Force, Dr John Brayley, who has ultimate responsibility for the healthcare of those held with Australia's immigration regime, was told of Shamshiripour's deteriorating mental state on several occasions in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter Brayley wrote and signed in August last year, he said he had been made aware of concerns over Shamshiripour's mental health management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our office is seeking a copy of his file, in particular to review his mental health records,&quot; Brayley wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correspondence from his office said it was &quot;actively monitoring&quot; Shamshiripour's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brayley did not return calls from the Guardian about what action, if any, his office took in Shamshiripour's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Shamshiripour died in PNG, he was legally under the care and control of the Australian government, according to international legal opinion, including the United Nations. Refugees held in offshore detention are &quot;under our supervision&quot;, Malcolm Turnbull told US president Donald Trump in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests are continuing in the Manus Island detention centre against the forcible closure of the centre, which will force refugees into the community on Manus Island where they say they are not safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island refugees seriously injured in machete attacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been increasing tension between refugees and Manusians in recent months, and a spate of violent attacks on refugees, including with machetes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One refugee on Manus who was reportedly flown to Port Moresby in recent days suffering severe head injuries from an attack, has since been medevacced to Australia in a critical condition, according to sources on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests have also been held on Nauru, with reports of five arrests, and accusations of police hitting a child and beating a young man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video of one purported protest shows a violent confrontation between protesters and Nauruan police, and the arrest of at least one person. Another shows dozens of protesters marching, saying &quot;our patience is over&quot; and &quot;shut down offshore&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One protester said an island bus had been burned outside the refugee camp - allegedly by Nauruan locals - and police had been called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous protests have resulted in arrests under Nauruan laws against three or more people congregating on public land in &quot;unlawful assembly&quot;, if the gathering causes reasonable fear that they will &quot;tumultuously disturb the peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man was charged after a rally of more than 100 people marched from a beach lodge to the refugee camp in February last year. Nauruan court documents said the march interrupted the flow of traffic, and scuffles caused reasonable likelihood of a breach of the peace. The man said he took part in the march, but was not an organiser.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a winter day eighteen months ago, Mohammed and his family, from Aleppo province, stood awkwardly in front of a makeshift outdoors photography studio set up at a refugee camp in Lebanon's Bekaa Valle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed's wife heldtheir newest baby and the twostood behind four chairs - one each for their two olderdaughters and two sons. One remained empty, representing their missing 21-year-old eldest, Reem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was separated from the family on her wedding night in 2013, when the region was being bombed by Syrian government forces; the family never knew what happened to her.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their lips are pursed thinly as they pose next to a physical reminder of their loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qom Elias refugee camp fire: Syrian mother whose home has been destroyed tells of loss in Lebanon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The haunting series of photographs of refugee families by Italian Dario Mitidieri was part of a campaign by Cafod and creative agency M&amp;C Saatchi which drew the world's attention to the plight of Lebanon's estimated 1.5 million refugees; families posed for portraits with spaces or empty chairs symbolising those killed, missing or still trapped in the war-torn country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitidieri's work won several awards, including a 2016 World Press Photo prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Cafod returned to the area in June this year to check how the families were doing, the agency was met with a rare piece of good news: Reem had managed to track her family down by searching social media profiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'When we found out about her and where she is we spent two days speaking on the phone,' Mohammed said (Louise Norton)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very happy. It had been four years that I didn't know anything about her,&quot; Mohammed said, eagerly showing photos on his picture phone of Reem, her husband and two young children in Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we found out about her and where she is we spent two days speaking on the phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reem is now trying to get a Turkish passport, which will allow her to visit her family, who are stranded in Lebanon in poverty sadly familiar in the tiny country of four million, where around one in four people are Syrian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spiralling residency costs, a lack of real work opportunities and a punishing cycle of debt mean that after six years of war next door, many refugees are losing hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It had been four years that I didn't know anything about her,'Mohammed said, eagerly showing photos on his phone of Reem, her husband and two young children in Istanbul (Louise Norton)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wary of how generations of Palestinians stayed in Lebanon after fleeing the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, when Syrians began to arrive in the country in earnest in 2013, the government refused to build official refugee camps in an effort to dissuade people from staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, most Syrians live in rented, often substandard or abandoned accommodation in towns, cities and informal settlements in the agricultural Bekaa Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel here that we aren't stable any more,&quot; Mohammed said. &quot;We are always afraid we might need to evacuate where we are living... Things are getting worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian couple married for 65 years still have each other despite losing everything in country's war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the struggles of Syrian refugees now rarely make headlines, their needs remain great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is just stagnating or getting worse,&quot; said Laura Ouseley, Cafod's World News Officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mohammed's story is a bittersweet one. It should be a reminder that even though these issues are out of the news, these people still need international help.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS A bleeding-heart - but busy - liberal, it's tough trying to remember what you were last outraged about. You remember signing a lot of petitions, carefully choosing which kind of emoji face to use on Facebook (&quot;wows&quot; are never OK) and furiously tweeting. You may have even made a witty banner and gone on a wee march. But then the news cycle moves on, and you get on with your busy life - and before you know it, there's a new hashtag movement in town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the issues remain as difficult as they ever were. Like the child refugees who are still alone in the woods near Calais and Dunkirk. The refugee camp at Calais known as the Jungle was demolished a year ago but children are still there alone and the conditions are even worse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday I attended a demonstration outside Parliament organised by the charities Help Refugees and Safe Passage to thank politicians for what has been done but to remind them that Britain promised to take 480 child refugees and yet only 200 of them are here. There was an eclectic gathering of people of all ages, from all backgrounds and faiths, and there were a number of young refugees who had been brought over from Calais as a result of the Dubs Amendment. I am not a great one for protests but this was genuinely moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in attendance was the architect of the campaign, Lord Dubs, who came to this country as a child refugee on Kindertransport, actress Juliet Stevenson and Camilla Thurlow from the reality TV hit Love Island. I know... that's mainly why I went, to be honest. Thankfully, I managed to restrain myself from asking deeply inappropriate questions about who got off with whom in the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, Camilla had just returned from France and she told me how adults and children now sleep outside in the open with no tents, and sometimes have their sleeping bags and blanket confiscated by the French police. And how mothers live with their toddlers among open sewage with nowhere to wash properly. When your eyes are open to this, it's hard to close them. And all of this is happening just over an hour away from us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Dubs is practical about the challenge. We can't take everyone but we can at least fill the 480 places promised by the Government before the temperature drops and rescue more children by Christmas. Many already have family here and under a European Union agreement they can be reunited with them, although there are fears that Brexit will jeopardise that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we prepare to leave the EU it is all the more important to send a message about Britain's place in the world and that we take our moral international obligations seriously - even the most ardent Brexiteer can see that is a proud part of our heritage and brand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the heat of the domestic row over immigration, freedom of labour and targets, it's easy to forget about the 280 children we promised safe passage to and still haven't. MPs must work with local authorities to make it happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How we honour our obligation on child refugees is a test of our national conscience, character and humanity. I spoke to young people from Syria and Sudan. Their gratitude was simple and their message overwhelming: we lost our country and you gave us a home. Thank you for bringing us to safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot save every child but we can save some, and surely, we must.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two weeks they sheltered the world's most wanted man, ferrying Edward Snowden between tiny apartments in Hong Kong's poorest neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the four refugees are at the centre of a court battle in Canada, as lawyers frantically work to bring them and their children to the country amid concerns that they face grave reprisals over their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like the families' connection to Snowden has made them radioactive and put them in a uniquely vulnerable situation,&quot; said Michael Simkin, one of the lawyers behind a motion filed this week in federal court and aimed at expediting asylum claims for the group in Canada. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Hong Kong refugees helped hide Edward Snowden after NSA leak</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The families lived in obscurity until last year, when Oliver Stone's film on the whistleblower revealed that Snowden had been protected by asylum seekers in Hong Kong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After journalists tracked them down, the refugees - three from Sri Lanka and one from the Philippines - came forward, explaining that they had been introduced by their mutual lawyer and that their actions had come before the US demand for Snowden's arrest was recognised in Hong Kong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the asylum seekers claim they've been routinely questioned by authorities to find out what they know about Snowden. Their lawyers have spoken out about relocating their clients several times over suspicions that members of Sri Lankan security forces are attempting to find them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, Hong Kong rejected their asylum claims, paving the way for deportation to their home countries, where the claimants say they could face imprisonment, torture and even death. Lawyers are now appealing the decisions; though they believe they have little hope of success. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, the asylum claimants - who include a former Sri Lankan soldier who alleges he was tortured by the army and a single mother from the Philippines who said she fled the country after being kidnapped and sexually assaulted - were ordered to report to a detention centre in Hong Kong in early August. Their lawyers fear their children will end up in foster care as the parents await deportation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every development in their cases is being carefully tracked in Montreal, where a team of lawyers have launched For the Refugees, a non-profit organisation dedicated to bringing the families to Canada as privately sponsored refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using funds collected from donors to cover the expenses of settling the families, the paperwork to bring the four adults and their three children to Canada was filed in January. &quot;We are encouraged by prime minister Trudeau's commitment in taking a clear lead internationally in welcoming refugees,&quot; lawyer Marc-Andr&eacute; S&eacute;guin said in April. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But months later, it appears that little progress has been made in processing the Canadian claims, said Simkin. &quot;Canada today is truly their last - and only - hope,&quot; added the lawyer. &quot;Once the families are arrested, it will severely compromise our ability to ever relocate them to Canada. Our clients' lives are at stake, and this may be their last chance to escape a horrific fate.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recognition of the urgency facing their cases, Simkin said that Canada's minister of immigration, Ahmed Hussen - who came to Canada as a teenaged refugee from Somalia - had committed in May to expedite the asylum claims. Two months later, consular officials said the files had not been fast-tracked, leaving the families at the whim of a process that could take years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simkin questioned why the Canadian government had seemingly changed its mind. &quot;We don't know if the US has put any kind of pressure on Canada, we don't know why Minister Hussen has reversed his decision ... What we do know is that the families and their three, stateless children who are under six years old are being punished, and that's just not right,&quot; he said. &quot;We cannot use these families as a proxy for punishing Edward Snowden.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After attempts to seek answers from the ministry proved fruitless, the lawyers said they were left with no other option but to file a legal challenge and hope that a federal court judge will force the Canadian government to fast-track the claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the office of the minister of immigration said that the government is committed to ensuring every case is evaluated in a fair manner. &quot;The Minister has not made any commitment to expedite this application,&quot; said a spokesperson for the minister, declining to comment further due to privacy reasons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal saga that has entangled the refugees has also attracted attention from Human Rights Watch, who - noting that Hong Kong has accepted fewer than one percent of refugee claims in recent years - urged Canada to open its doors to the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The compassionate act of letting Edward Snowden into their homes should never have landed these families in peril,&quot; the organisation's Dinah PoKempner said in a statement. &quot;No one should have to risk a return to torture or persecution because they opened their door to another who feared the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His arrest comes after an18-year-old was arrested at 7.50am in Dover port on Saturday morningas he attempted to board a ferry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood he had come to Britain aged 15 after he had spent months attempting to smuggle himself into the UK, while living in the notorious makeshift Calais refugee camp known as The Jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee charity is believed to have helped his passage into Britain in 2014 and placed him in foster care with at least two families in Kent, before he moved in with another family in South West London in the last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative leader of Spelthorne Borough Council Ian Harvey - whose ward is Sunbury East close to where the teenager had been living - said last night: &quot;One thing I understand is that he was an Iraqi refugee who came here aged 15. His parents died in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penelope and Ronald Jones, aged 71 and 88, who received MBEs from the Queen for services to children and families, took the Iraqi teen into their home after a lifetime devoted to caring for vulnerable children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neighbours told yesterday how the couple - who have been foster parents for almost 40 years, taking in up to 300 children, including eight refugees - were &quot;at their wits' end&quot; with the teenager who had only been living with them for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could CCTV footage show the Parsons Green tube bomber?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect, who is being held in custody on suspicion of planting the homemade bucket bomb on the London Underground, is said to have had a furious bust-up with his foster parents two weeks ago after he was brought back to the house in leafy Sunbury-upon-Thames in a marked police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area is just a 37-minute train ride from Wimbledon station, where the tube that was bombed began its journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood he was picked up by police at Parsons Green station two weeks ago - where the bomb exploded - before being escorted back to the Jones' home in a squad car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland Yard forensics officers wearing protective overalls, hoods and face masks were inside the Stanwell flat throughout yesterday. It is believed no explosive materials were found there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Griffiths, who lives across from Penny and Ron, told how police said the couple's home would be examined by forensics officers for &quot;at least a week&quot; after &quot;significant materials&quot; were found in the loft space above the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I think that while Penny and Ron have been away, the lads were in the loft taking bit by bit down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was only yesterday when they said the guy had been making bombs in there that I thought: 'What?' This is all just crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Builder Dave Solway, 44, who also lives opposite the elderly couple, told of a row between the 18-year-old suspect and Ron outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lad was out the front shouting and swearing at Ron, telling him he was leaving. I know the couple were at their wits' end, I think they were told he was a lot younger than he is which is why they agreed to take him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poor Ron was trying to get the lad to go in the house but he just kept saying he wanted to leave for London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe this has happened to such nice people, I really feel for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Schoolboy crushed by commuters fleeing Parsons Green bucket bomb reveals terrifying ordeal                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family friend Jim Adaway, 37, said the Joneses had only recently returned to foster caring to help resettle youngsters from overseas, after requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I think Penny was getting in touch with the council and telling them she couldn't handle the teenager as he was out of control. I don't know if they felt it was the right decision to start taking kids on again which is such a shame after everything they've done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other neighbours told how terror police recovered explosives from the Jones' house. A mum - who identified herself as Carrie and lives on the evacuated road - said police told her they had found 15 firearms at the house and a bomb in the garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police refused to comment on speculation about what was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home SecretaryAmber Ruddyesterday said the UK's threat level has been lowered from critical to severe. She added: &quot;It still means an attack is highly likely, so I would urge everybody to continue to be vigilant but not alarmed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the country's top counter-terrorism officer, said police were gaining a &quot;greater understanding of the preparation of the device&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security services are trying to find how the Iraqi teen entered the country and who he had associated with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just one person was last night still being treated in hospital following the bomb attempt - for serious wounds to their lower body.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pushing the boundaries', an ambitious research project led by Dr David James Cantor from the Refugee Law Initiative (RLI), part of the University of London's School of Advanced Study, has been shortlisted for the Times Higher Education Awards 2017.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The winners are due to be announced at a gala ceremony on 30 November.<BR><BR>The purpose of the three-year initiative (full title 'Pushing the boundaries: new dynamics of forced migration and transnational responses in Latin America'), which was supported by a Future Research Leader grant from the Economic and Social Research Council, was to analyse how Latin American states use transnational structures and interventions to address new security and justice challenges resulting from forced migration flows. It is shortlisted in the awards' Research Project of the Year: Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences category.<BR><BR>It involved an international group of researchers, and produced the first serious study of the dynamics of forced migration provoked not by war or government persecution but by the activities of organised criminal groups. In addition, 'Pushing the boundaries' spearheaded research on this 'new' cause of forced migration and shifted the traditional notions concerning legal protection of refugees in Latin America.<BR><BR>Through an historical study the project:<BR><BR>.developed a simpler and more elegant interpretation of the Latin American expanded refugee definition in the 1984 Cartagena Declaration<BR><BR>.delineated a progressive framework for protecting asylum-seekers under the Inter-American Human Rights System<BR><BR>.shed new light on transnational connections between asylum practices in Europe and Latin America<BR><BR>Collectively, these findings presented a novel model of Latin American cooperation in refugee protection as a viable alternative to regional models applied in Europe and elsewhere.<BR><BR>'My colleagues and I are delighted by the recognition that this shortlisting for the Times Higher Education Awards Research Project of the Year 2017 gives to research in the field of refugees and internally displaced persons. The shortlisting also benefits this overlooked region of Latin America by further publicising the need for both understanding and action on the intractable forced displacement caused by organised crime in these countries,' said Dr David James Cantor, RLI director.<BR><BR>The research has also influenced United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) protection policy relating to people fleeing criminal violence in the Northern Triangle of Central America. Between October 2015 and May 2016, Dr Cantor fed into the development of UNHCR refugee protection policy relating to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. This not only guides UNHCR action but also that of the region's governments.<BR><BR>In addition to the rallying call it presented to researchers and policymakers worldwide, the 'Pushing the boundaries' project resulted in Dr Cantor taking up a one-year part-time secondment as the principal adviser to UNHCR's Americas Bureau. He is now drafting strategy for the region, as well as other policy instruments to guide UNHCR and governments in addressing protection challenges for refugees, asylum-seekers and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).<BR><BR>'This is important recognition for an excellent and innovative project tackling an issue which is devastating for those affected, often in acutely threatening situations,' said Professor Rick Rylance, the School of Advanced Study's dean and University of London pro vice-chancellor (research). 'The School is proud of it and of the work done by David Cantor and his colleagues. We are especially proud that it helps those in predicaments of dislocation and displacement. We add our warmest congratulations.'<BR><BR>Now in their 13th year the Times Higher Education Awards - the 'Oscars of higher education' - are a highlight of the academic calendar and a celebration of the best in UK higher education. Each year, they attract hundreds of entries in 19 categories covering the full range of university activity.<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Pope Francis has issued a 20-point action plan to governments on refugees and migrants to try to galvanise their response to an issue seen by the Vatican  as one of the biggest global challenges of the 21st century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His intention is to lay the ground for the drafting of two global compacts on refugees and migration, which are expected to be adopted at the UN general assembly in September 2018. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roadmap was published on Monday by the Vatican's migrants and refugees section, which was set up by Francis last year and operates under his direction. The action points were personally approved by the pontiff. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a message issued before publication, Francis said he had &quot;repeatedly expressed my particular concern for the lamentable situation of many migrants and refugees fleeing from war, persecution, natural disasters and poverty&quot;. The situation was &quot;undoubtedly a 'sign of the times',&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, Responding to Refugees and Migrants: Twenty Action Points, says the world is facing &quot;the largest movement of displaced people in recent memory&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says: &quot;While massive numbers of people have been forced to leave their homes due to persecution, violence, natural disasters and the scourge of poverty, migration should nevertheless be recognised, not as a new phenomenon, but rather as a natural human response to crisis and a testament to the innate desire of every human being for happiness and a better life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This reality, with its important cultural and spiritual dimensions, is having a significant impact on attitudes and reactions all over the world.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document's 20 points are grouped in four calls to action: to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate. Their &quot;ultimate goal is the building of an inclusive and sustainable common home for all&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before detailing the action plan, the authors suggest that distinguishing between migrants and refugees, as the UN does in its separate compacts, is problematic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Empirical evidence shows that migration is more and more mixed. This makes it difficult to maintain a clear-cut distinction between migrants and refugees. Often their needs are very similar if not identical,&quot; the document says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among its action points are the creation of legal pathways for safe and voluntary migration and resettlement, and a ban on arbitrary and collective expulsions. It suggests states make wider use of humanitarian, student and family reunification visas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document says greater support should be available for countries that have borne the brunt of migration: more than half the world's displaced people are in Africa and the Middle East, with 17% in Europe, according to the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his message, Francis said personal safety and dignity should be prioritised over national security and, &quot;for the sake of the fundamental dignity of every human person, we must strive to find alternative solutions to detention for those who enter a country without authorisation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis has indicated that migration should be a major Vatican focus in the run-up to the 2018 UN general assembly. He has made the issue central to his papacy since visiting the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa, where thousands of migrants have landed, within weeks of his election. He has also housed several Syrian refugee families  in the Vatican. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham Gordon, of the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: &quot;The Holy Father is making clear that all countries must step up to the plate and pull their weight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one of the greatest crises of the century so far. Not for the first time, the pope is reminding politicians that history will judge whether they rise to the challenge or abdicate their responsibility.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy 's anti-immigrant Northern League party, wrote on Facebook: &quot;If you want to do it in the Vatican, go ahead. But as a Catholic, I don't think Italy can welcome and support the whole world.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government will take heart from Ben Doherty's enthusiastic account of a New South Wales refugee resettlement programme ( 30&nbsp;June ). A senior bureaucrat promotes the nation's acceptance of more than 500,000 refugees since the second world war (that's 82 years). Australia - a wealthy country - has benefited handsomely from their labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No mention of the shamefully small numbers of recently displaced Syrians settled and the long waiting times for even these lucky few. No mention of the bipartisan policy of indefinite detention of 821 refugees on Manus Island. Well, they are &quot;free to leave&quot; their prison - just not the island. Good news stories such as the programme in western Sydney should at the very least be placed in this context. Margaret JacobsAireys Inlet, Victoria, Australia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Ben Doherty is an excellent journalist. But the good news story on Australia's &quot;can do&quot; capital for refugees is not the one that needs to be told. The one that the world needs to know about is of defenceless people, refugees, human beings, being held hostage for years on the prison islands of Manus (part of Papua New Guinea) and Nauru, by the Australian government. That is apart from the thousands of asylum seekers being held in camps around Australia for months and years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not easily to reconcile this with most people's image of Australia as a friendly, sunny country. But it is true. Please do not take my word for it. Please check it with Amnesty International or the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please help us by shaming Australia, by making this story known. Stephen LangfordPaddington, NSW, Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        Britain and Brexit                                                           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago following Brexit, I contacted my adult daughters in London recalling the anxious push, decades earlier, to gain entry to Europe. Little wonder, therefore, my fervent support for Jonathan Freedland's rhetorical proposition, Can Brexit be stopped ( 30 June )?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British electorate, a year ago, heeded false prophets (Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson) and false premises (an extra weekly &pound;350m to the NHS). What is now clear is that as Britain leaves, Britain loses; from an already eroded sterling, lost trade, lost respect from Ireland and the Europeans, a potential Scottish succession, and geopolitical isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the wafer-thin Brexit result a year ago not a step has been concluded, yet Britain is already significantly poorer and bereft. Then came last month's spot-on general election. The voters, importantly younger voters, rallied to the cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poleaxe hubris, pally-up to Merkel, Macron and Tusk, get Britain back on track, exit Brexit. Robert RiddellHelensville, New Zealand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; In your 9 June cover story, How US became a rogue state, Joseph Stiglitz says: &quot;Donald Trump has thrown a hand grenade into the global economic architecture that was so painstakingly constructed in the years after the end of the second world war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider what the British government and her two prime ministers David Cameron and Theresa May have done. They have thrown a time bomb into the European Union, so painstakingly constructed in the years after the end of the second world war, which resulted in the deaths of millions of young people. Does this make Great Britain a&nbsp;&quot;rogue state&quot;? SH JayasenaColombo, Sri Lanka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Trophy hunting must end                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the only value of African wildlife is as a boutique economic commodity for sale to wealthy humans, then Donald Trump doesn't seem so much an aberration ( Rewilding comes with a condition, 30 June ). When you consider that the market for big-game hunting rests solely on a willingness to pay serious money on the gratification of killing the largest specimens of rare wild animals from a safe distance, it is clear that homo sapiens have more pressing problems than a love of lethal recreation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After serious international lobbying, China has finally bowed to international moral and environmental pressure by curbing its ivory market. The world now needs to legislate to make trophy hunting too onerous for both &quot;sportsmen&quot; and the bent politicians in backward states who facilitate the industry. John HaywardWeegena, Tasmania, Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        Briefly                                                           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     &middot;  With reference to the article How Corbyn changed the rules of British politics ( 30 June ), Gary Younge built&nbsp;a formidable retelling of the election with his observations at Harrow West. I echo his view that we have seen a narrow retraction from pundits who expected a different result. The brunt of austerity spread beyond the poorest and public sector workers. Voters followed their instincts to push for political change, no matter how remote that possibility seemed. Stephen BanksBirmingham, UK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Your Eyewitnessed photo of French bus drivers in skirts ( 30 June ) is similar to recent photos of English schoolboys also denied permission to wear shorts in hot weather and who engaged in protest. What is it that dictates such ridiculous dress codes? Going back over 50 years, boys, albeit below a certain age, were compelled to wear shorts to school. Nowadays boys, albeit above a certain age, are forbidden to wear shorts even on blisteringly hot days. Maria CarterBedford, UK</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN Irish woman has described the terrifying plight of Sudanese refugees forced to run from their homes when gunwielding men attacked their village and killed their loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maedhbh McDonald, 27, from Dublin, has just returned from one of the world's largest asylumseeker camps in Western Ethiopia where just under 890,000 migrants are living in temporary shelter after fleeing war, famine and drought in neighbouring nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the refugees in Gambella are from South Sudan, which has been torn by civil war since 2013, two years after it became the world's youngest country by getting independence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Sudanese conflict, as well as a collapsing economy, resulted in the UN declaring famine in February with 100,000 people facing starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The devastation has left around a third of the country's 12.2 million population severely food insecure and almost two million have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So many people were killed in front of us - even children,&quot; was one of the sobering recollections Maedhbh heard from one of the refugees escaping the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mother-of-two Nyakoun Tut, 24, fled a bloody attack on her village where her two brothers and many neighbours were murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traumatised woman recalled she too feared being shot and killed along with her young girl Knyakotar, who she carried to safety on foot into Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;We walked for six days without food... my daughter cried the whole way,&quot; The young mum also lost her husband in the chaos that ensued during the attack, but they were reunited later in the refugee camp she now calls home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maedhbh described as &quot;admirable&quot; the mental strength and resilience of women like Nyakoun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior content editor with Concern Worldwide said: &quot;She is only 24 and has witnessed things that I can't even imagine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite all her trauma and hardship, Nyakoun is able to get up every day and put on a brave face and just get on with life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has this innate resilience that is so admirable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her story is unbelievably shocking. A militia came to her village. People were running. She said there were bodies all around her and her brothers were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nyakoun took hold of her daughter and just ran. They walked without food for almost a week before reaching the border and the safety of the refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When in the camp she was reunited with her husband and they have since had a son Thujin, who sadly became malnourished, but was treated by Concern staff and is now on his way to recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are hundreds of thousands of people in Gambella who fled on foot from their country with nothing. They left not knowing if their loved ones are OK and are living in a huge state of insecurity - but somehow they just get on with life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just have to put one foot in front of the other each day - for their with children.&quot; Maedhbh was in Gambella to share the stories of refugees for Concern Worldwide's Christmas Appeal, which urges people to fund its work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;When I was there I really saw for myself how important aid is to people like Nyakoun and her family - without it Thujin wouldn't have survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know from talking to staff that by donating, even the cost of a Nyakoun. Tut son Thujin cup of tea, you can help save other children like Thujin from suffering malnutrition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia has been praised for opening its borders to so many asylum seekers, despite having many challenges of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi described it earlier this year as a shining example of African and global hospitality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Victorian Liberal moderate Russell Broadbent has called for &quot;genuine refugees&quot; in offshore detention to be settled permanently on the Australian mainland once the US resettlement deal has run its course. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadbent signalled his intention to break ranks with government policy in a short speech to parliament just before question time on Wednesday, saying it was &quot;time for this parliament to act to resolve the situation on Manus and Nauru&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former member once said, there's a rubbish bin there, and it smells, and you can't walk past it</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Russell Broadbent    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The veteran Liberal, who has campaigned within the Liberal party and across party lines on behalf of asylum seekers, referenced a column from Guardian Australia's David Marr as the prompt for him to call for a permanent resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, Broadbent quoted the opening of Marr's piece, which was published last week : &quot;If only Christians fought like this for refugees. Imagine if the Coalition's big men of faith threatened to tear down their own government unless it brings home the wretches we've imprisoned in the Pacific. Surely there couldn't be a greater service for Christ?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadbent told parliament: &quot;David Marr can be pretty hard when he writes. It comes out of his life experience, and I accept that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Two Coalition MPs join Tim Watts in call for more private sponsorship of refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberal MP said he could not ignore the challenge he laid down. &quot;I couldn't walk past it. Eventually you come to a place in your time - as a former member once said - there's a rubbish bin there, and it smells, and you can't walk past it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Enough. El Shaddai. Enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadbent said he was &quot;happy&quot; with the progress of the US refugee resettlement deal but once that process had concluded it was time for the parliament to act to ensure people were not subject to indefinite detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech was greeted with a round of applause by MPs in the chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked after the speech what he meant by parliamentary action to resolve the situation on Nauru and Manus, Broadbent told Guardian Australia: &quot;It means the Australian parliament should act to resolve the situation of people in long-term offshore detention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who are genuine refugees should be brought home to Australia,&quot; he said. &quot;Those who aren't genuine refugees - we need to work hard to find another place for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Abbott's obstruction of gay marriage is a defence of privilege and the power of shame | David Marr</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coalition's punitive policy forbids boat arrivals ever being settled on the Australian mainland. Its opponents say people now in offshore immigration centres are subject to indefinite detention despite the fact they have broken no laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The offshore detention centres have attracted condemnation in Australia and internationally for alleged human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadbent's decision to break ranks with government policy follows comments by Paris Aristotle, a member of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers that proposed Australia restart offshore processing of boat-borne asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aristotle told an audience in Sydney on Tuesday night: &quot;The detention centres are terrible, I've been opposed to indefinite mandatory detention for years, the impact is awful for people - but really what crushes people is an absence of hope and an absence of connection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said current arrangements did not deter asylum seekers from boarding boats, and the regime that had been implemented did not reflect the recommendations the expert panel had made to the Gillard government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of the global humanitarian crisis that has been unfolding since the Arab spring precipitated revolt and instability across the Middle East in 2011 can feel overwhelming. In the past few weeks alone, terrible stories have emerged of the brutal treatment of Rohingya Muslims, forced to flee Myanmar to grim camps in neighbouring Bangladesh. A fortnight ago, CNN ran a devastating film shot undercover in Libya, showing young migrants from Nigeria being auctioned into slavery. The sight and sound of a market in human beings carries a weight that dwarfs other reporters' graphic accounts of the scale of the trade. The impact of the CNN report drew unflattering attention to the EU-backed programme run by Libya to detain and repatriate migrants in order to prevent them attempting the Mediterranean crossing into Italy or Spain. This is an arrangement of convenience for Europe. It has led to migrants being held in wretched and degrading conditions that in an unusual rebuke of the countries that pay a significant part of the costs, were condemned by the UN as &quot;inhuman&quot;. This week the EU met with members of the African Union in Addis Ababa. The EU has now signed up to a programme to repatriate migrants rather than leaving the huge task to a country that is still in turmoil after the fall of Gadaffi, which was backed by the UK, France and the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The great majority of the world's displaced people flee to the nearest safe place, often another poor or middle-income country: in the past year a million refugees have arrived in Uganda from South Sudan. By far the largest part of the responsibility for those displaced around the Middle East has been borne by neighbouring countries, in particular Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Europe has been reluctant and defensive in responding to a crisis for which it is at least partly to blame. There has been a complete failure to agree a fair process for resettlement of refugees across the 28 member states. Greece and Italy have been left, for years now, to manage an unprecedented influx of desperate men, women and children. In an unparalleled international political vacuum, there has been little global leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the New York declaration on refugees and migrants tried to lay the framework for a positive approach. It starts with recognising realities: the forces that motivate young people to risk death in the hope of a better life need to be met not by the kind of resistance that ends up with thousands being penned up in a filthy Libyan detention centre, but by opening up legal channels of migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrants want to work, and they want to be able to send cash home. Remittances are worth many billions of dollars to the economies of the global south; they cannot replace development aid, but they far outstrip its value. This time next year a UN refugee summit in Morocco aims to have a programme for legal migration in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A humane policy for migrants would make it easier to distinguish and meet our obligations to refugees, those who flee in fear. The responsibility for displaced people has fallen on poorer countries in a grossly disproportionate way. At the very least, there should be a programme of education so that every child in every camp has a school place. Internally displaced people need to be helped to find work (not always easy) and supported with direct cash payments that will go back into the local economy. But all of this depends on changing attitudes, above all moving away from the language of threat. Many people in the rich world want to - and do - support refugees, often in a more personal way than giving money: Canada's scheme, for example, of finding sponsors for 15,000 Syrian refugees  was hugely oversubscribed. Fear often speaks with a powerful voice. But so can that other great human emotion, solidarity. The former foreign secretary David Miliband has called this crisis a test of humanity. It is one that we must not fail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tahir, his wife and their year-old daughter are in a special camp at Siddiq Nagar in Haryana's Nuh town, about 100km from the city.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They, like hundreds of refugees from the community settled in the National Capital Region, do not want to return to their native country.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court will next month hear the plea of two Rohingya refugees who have approached it against the Centre's decision to deport Rohingya Muslims to Myanmar.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We would not even dream of going back to Myanmar. We are not treated as human in a state ruled by Buddhist people. We did not know what freedom is since childhood. We have experienced it only after reaching the soil of India,' Tahir said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas have fled from Myanmar following a military crackdown, which the UN has described as ethnic cleansing, with many taking refuge in Bangladesh and some then crossing a porous border into India.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar says its forces are carrying out their legitimate duty to restore order after guerrilla attacks in August on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 63 families at the Siddiq Nagar camp and all of them echo the same view.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamad Shadik, head of the shelter, said the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar has been simmering for years but it boiled over in 2010 and later.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The number of people from our community in Bangladesh went up to over 10 lakhs, and many crossed the border to reach Kolkata,' Shadik said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centre sees the Rohingya refugees as a security threat, arguing that the illegal migrants are vulnerable to getting recruited by terrorist organisations and are also a burden on the country's limited resources.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to government data, there are 1,360 Rohingya Muslims, or 400 families, living in Mewat, which is a cultural region that spans Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Siddiq Nagar area has two camps: the second one called Nangli 2 or Siddiq Nagar 2 where 100 families live in hutments. Besides, 55 families live in Ferozepur Namak, 60 in Chandni village and 23 families in Punhana area.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Buddhist people along with local police and military (in Myanmar) gang-rape our women and girls, behead youths, torch our houses and madrasas, and throw our children in the fire,' Shadik said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The laws of human rights do not apply there, so how can we live in such a situation?' Shadik told Mail Today that members of the community living in Delhi's Uttam Nagar, Faridabad in Haryana and Rajasthan's Jaipur city have also contacted him.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees in Mewat claimed that 15,500 Rohingyas are registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in India and have obtained smart cards. Sources say over 40,000 Rohingyas are living in various parts of India.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiyab Mohammad, who owns a small grocery shop at the Siddiq Nagar camp, said the Buddhists do not consider the Rohingyas Myanmar nationals.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I crossed the border (into Bangladesh) alone and sent a message to my family members to come over due to the threat to their lives,' he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'My wife, three sons and two daughters crossed the border a day later to reach Chittagong. After living there for four months and earning some money, we were forced by local police to leave Bangladesh too.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We finally decided to cross into India. Crossing India- Bangladesh border is not easy in daylight and therefore we did it in the night as there is hardly any patrolling of border security personnel then.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His daughter, Rashida, said they do not have any passport or other documents to be identified as Myanmar nationals. 'We just have the UNHCR card issued from New Delhi,' she said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say India is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and is therefore not bound by the principle of 'nonrefoulment'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-refoulment, a principle in international law, stops a country from returning refugees to a place where they could be at risk of persecution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are continuously monitoring activities of Rohingyas in the camps of Nuh,' Vipin Kumar, the SHO of Nuh police station, told Mail Today.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The police personnel along with CID visit camps every 10 to 15 days and check with the camp heads about who left the place and if any new people came in. We cannot allow any Rohingyas to live in the camp without having a UNHCR card.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Donald Trump's childhood home in New York had some new occupants over the weekend - refugees who shared their stories as a way to draw attention to the refugee crisis as the United Nations General Assembly convenes this week with Trump in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-storey Tudor-style home in Queens that Trump's father, Fred, built in 1940 is now a rental available on Airbnb that anyone can stay in for $725 a night. It was auctioned off to an unidentified buyer in March for $2.14 million, its second time going up for auction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international anti-poverty organisation Oxfam rented it on Saturday and invited four refugees to talk with journalists. The Republican President's administration issued travel bans on people from six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees. After various court challenges, the Supreme Court last week allowed the restrictive policy on refugees to remain temporarily. The justices will hear arguments on the bans 10 October.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wanted to send a strong message to Trump and world leaders that they must do more to welcome refugees,&quot; said Shannon Scribner, acting director for the humanitarian department of Oxfam America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump lived in the house on a tree-lined street of single-family dwellings until he was about four, when his family moved to another home his father had built nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an upstairs bedroom, Eiman Ali, 22, looked around at the dark wood floors and a copy of the book </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump: The Art of the Deal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on a nearby table and wondered about the home's previous resident.</SPAN></P>

Ali said she remembered Trump as an entertaining character on &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice,&quot; but has since changed her opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To have someone so outspoken against my community become the president of the United States was very eye-opening and hurtful because I have invested a lot in this country,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the hall, Ghassan al-Chahada, 41, a Syrian refugee who arrived in the United States with his wife and three children in 2012, sat in a room with bunk beds and a sign on the wall that said it likely was Trump's childhood bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the conflict began in Syria we had dreams of coming to America,&quot; al-Chahada said. &quot;For us, it was a dream come true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Chahada said his life changed when Trump signed the ban that barred people from Syria and five other countries, from entering the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had hopes I would get my green card and be able to visit my country,&quot; al-Chahada said. &quot;But since Trump was elected I don't dare, I don't dare leave this country and not be able to come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He looked out the window into the front yard and thought about what he would say to the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would advise him to remember, to think about how he felt when he slept in this bedroom,&quot; al-Chahada said. &quot;If he can stay in tune with who he was as a child, the compassion children have and the mercy, I would say he's a great person.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greek government said yesterday that it could not accept a German decision to start sending back asylum seekers who had passed through its borders because it was overwhelmed by the tens of thousands already on its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement, from a senior migration official, suggests that there will be tension between Athens and Berlin before German elections next month. The far-right Alternative for Germany party is trying to revive migration as a political issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be tragic if not hugely nonsensical for Greece to take back refugees from Germany and other European countries as it battles to manage 60,000 refugees and migrants already stranded here,&quot; the Greek official said. &quot;It's not an issue of Greece not wanting, rather of it not being able, to take back refugees because it simply does not have the space.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Accommodation facilities are already up to the brim with refugees. They are at breaking point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking on condition of anonymity because of his proximity to talks with the EU on the migrant returns, which are expected to begin next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paris yesterday Angela Merkel joined a French-led attempt to manage the flow of migrants from Africa through action against people smugglers along the migrant routes and aid to help to improve conditions there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders of Chad, Niger and Libya, all transit countries for migrants, were at a meeting in the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace along with President Macron, Paolo Gentiloni, the Italian prime minister, and Mariano Rajoy, his Spanish counterpart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the so-called Dublin rules EU states are required to return asylum seekers to their country of entry to the 28-nation bloc. Germany and other states suspended the returns in 2011 after the European Court of Human Rights questioned Greece's ability to take back migrants because of its economic crisis, harsh conditions and poor treatment of refugees by local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greek official said that Berlin and Athens were in continuous contact about the controversial plan but Greece was not prepared to accept more than 50 asylum seekers in special shelters in the capital and in the historic city of Thebes. &quot;It will just be a symbolic gesture,&quot; the official said. &quot;We want to show that Greece is upholding its side of its commitments in this migration crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks echo the government's call for a revision of the Dublin regulations. They also mark a fresh jab at Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to take in thousands of migrants and refugees in line with an agreement to help to ease an unprecedented build-up of asylum seekers in Greece and Italy. Fewer than 20,000 of an estimated 160,000 relocations have been completed since the agreement was reached two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's executive branch has launched infringement procedures against the three states, giving them until the end of the month to reconsider their refusal to resettle even a single refugee as part of the EU-wide scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month Ioannis Mouzalas, the Greek migration minister, told the German public service broadcaster ARD that Berlin's demand for the refugee returns was part of Mrs Merkel's election strategy. &quot;There was pressure from several EU countries to resume returns,&quot; Mr Mouzalas said. &quot;I understand that governments want to show some results to their voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French-led initiative is aimed at staunching the flow across the Mediterranean through a combination of incentives to remain in Africa and international action against the traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Macron has backed away from a proposal made in July in which he called for &quot;hot spots&quot; to be set up to process asylum applications in Libya. France is now focusing on shoring up the Tripoli-based administration of Libya, which is the main gateway for migrants heading north.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump voiced his concerns to Turnbull in a phone call that took place eight days after he was inaugurated.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tone and tenor of the conversation were already known - The Washington Post  revealed snippets of the terse conversation several days later.&nbsp;The publication put out a full transcript of the conversation this morning, though, that reveals just how angry Trump was about the refugee deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous,' Trump tells Turnbull near the end of the January call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the talk grew tense Trump told him, 'You have brokered many a stupid deal in business.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump took the Oath of Office on Jan. 20. He spoke to Turnbull over the phone on Jan. 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the call the new president repeatedly misstated the number of refugees the U.S. had agreed to take on and opined that the deal with Australia put him in a 'bad position' his first week on the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Trump's first acts in office had been to sign a refugee ban prohibiting arrivals from citizens of seven countries on a temporary basis.&nbsp;The group included Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's administration had previously agreed to accept 1,250 refugees of those nationalities and others who were being held in detention centers off Australia's coast in Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions at the detention centers had prompted United Nations condemnation. The U.S. said it would take in half of the population, so long as they passed security screening tests that other refugees have also been submitted to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 1 the US embassy in Canberra said President Trump would honor the deal with Australia, despite his issuing an executive order that barred other refugees from those countries from setting foot on U.S. soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not too long after, Trump tweeted: 'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His tweet cast the United States' commitment to the deal into doubt, as well as its relationship with Australia, a key ally that it shares intelligence with as part of the 'Five Eyes' agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Mike Pence assured Australians in April during a visit to Sydney that the U.S. would hold up its end of the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But it doesn't mean we admire the agreement,' Pence said during a news conference. 'Frankly looking back at the last administration, the President has never been shy about expressing frustration with other international agreements, most notably the so-called nuclear agreement with Iran.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Trump sat down with Turnbull in May for a conversation aboard the Intrepid in New York, he told reporters that earlier characterizations of their call were off base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We had a great telephone call. You guys exaggerated that call. That was a big exaggeration. We're not babies. That was a little bit of fake news,' he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Washington Post had put out portions of the call to that point, but not the full transcript. An unedited copy of the conversation that it posted to its website this morning backs up its previous assertions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump suggested during the talk with Turnbull that he could renege on the refugee deal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I do not know what he got out of it. We never get anything out of it - START Treaty, the Iran deal. I do not know where they find these people to make these stupid deals. I am going to get killed on this thing,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull assures him, 'You will not.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump pushes back and says, 'Yes, I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his counterpart says, 'You can certainly say that it was not a deal that you would have done, but you are going to stick with it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am going to say that I have no choice but to honor my predecessor's deal. I think it is a horrible deal, a disgusting deal that I would have never made. It is an embarrassment to the United States of America and you can say it just the way I said it. I will say it just that way,' Trump tells Turnbull 'As far as I am concerned that is enough Malcom.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Trump fumes, 'I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, 'This is crazy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull attempted to end the call on a high note, telling Trump, 'Thank you for your commitment. It is very important to us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is important to you and it is embarrassing to me. It is an embarrassment to me, but at least I got you off the hook. So you put me back on the hook,' Trump replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian leader stressed to Trump that he wouldn't regret it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You can count on me. I will be there again and again,' Turnbull asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         TEN TIMES TRUMP SNIPED AT TURNBULL                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUMP: 'I do not know where they find these people to make these stupid deals. I am going to get killed on this thing.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUMP: 'I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUMP: 'I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous. This is crazy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUMP: 'The United States has become like a dumping ground.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUMP: 'Look, I spoke to Putin, Merkel, Abe of Japan, to France today, and this was my most unpleasant call.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUMP: 'I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUMP: 'You have brokered many a stupid deal in business and I respect you, but I guarantee that you broke many a stupid deal. This is a stupid deal. This deal will make me look terrible.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUMP: 'I say that it was a stupid deal like all the other deals that this country signed.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRUMP: 'Can Australia give me a guarantee that if we have any problems - you know that is what they said about the Boston bombers. They said they were wonderful young men.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calming down, Trump told him, 'I hope so. Okay, thank you Malcolm.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Okay, thank you,' Turnbull said before they disconnected.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official White House read out of the chat says the two leaders 'emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the U.S.-Australia relationship.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WaPo's transcript of the talk emphasizes Trump's frustration with the refugee deal and the trouble he had wrapping his head round it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Who made the deal? Obama?' he says partway through. 'Yes, but let me describe what it is. I think it is quite consistent. I think you can comply with it,' Turnbull tells him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was after Trump told him that taking in 2,000 people who are 'probably troublesome...will make us look awfully bad' in the context of his Syrian refugee ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Here I am calling for a ban where I am not letting anybody in and we take 2,000 people,' Trump says. 'Really it looks like 2,000 people that Australia does not want and I do not blame you by the way, but the United States has become like a dumping ground.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump goes on to say: 'I love Australia; I love the people of Australia. I have so many friends from Australia, but I said - geez that is a big ask, especially in light of the fact that we are so heavily in favor, not in favor, but we have no choice but to stop things.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have to stop. We have allowed so many people into our country that should not be here. We have our San Bernardino's, we have had the World Trade Center come down because of people that should not have been in our country, and now we are supposed to take 2,000. It sends such a bad signal. You have no idea. It is such a bad thing.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull informs Trump in response that the deal doesn't require the U.S. to take 2,000 people in. In fact, it doesn't require the United States to accept a single refugee, if they don't meet the vetting standards.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also tells Trump, a leading businessman in America before he was elected, that it's important to respect deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Every individual is subject to your vetting. You can decide to take them or to not take them after vetting. You can decide to take 1,000 or 100. It is entirely up to you,' Turnbull says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also assures Trump that 'none of these people are from the conflict zone.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They are basically economic refugees from Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. That is the vast bulk of them. They have been under our supervision for over three years now and we know exactly everything about them.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason they cannot come onto the mainland is because Australia bars refugee arrivals by boat, Turnbull explains, to stop smugglers from trafficking them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We had to deprive them of the product,' Turnbull says. 'So we said if you try to come to Australia by boat, even if we think you are the best person in the world, even if you are a Noble [sic] Prize winning genius, we will not let you in.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump tells him, 'That is a good idea. We should do that too. You are worse than I am.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They then veer off into a discussion about Angela Merkel's refugee policy and its effect on Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I spoke to Merkel today, and believe me, she wishes she did not do it. Germany is a mess because of what happened,' Trump says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump later comes back to the '2,000' refugees he thinks the U.S. is taking in - and proclaims that he's also hear it's 'like 5,000 as well.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The given number in the agreement is 1,250 and it is entirely a matter of your vetting,' Turnbull informs him.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump disagrees with him, then lays on his first insult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Look, I spoke to Putin, Merkel, Abe of Japan, to France today, and this was my most unpleasant call because I will be honest with you. I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From there, the conversation goes downhill, with Trump telling Turnbull that deals like this one cost Obama's party the presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That is why they lost the election, because of stupid deals like this. You have brokered many a stupid deal in business and I respect you, but I guarantee that you broke many a stupid deal. This is a stupid deal. This deal will make me look terrible.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull politely rebuffs him, reminding him once again of the pre-existing commitment, and Trump says, 'This shows me to be a dope. I am not like this but, if I have to do it, I will do it but I do not like this at all.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think it is ridiculous and Obama should have never signed it. The only reason I will take them is because I have to honor a deal signed by my predecessor and it was a rotten deal. I say that it was a stupid deal like all the other deals that this country signed,' Trump says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a bit of back and forth Trump asks Turnbull, 'Can Australia give me a guarantee that if we have any problems - you know that is what they said about the Boston bombers. They said they were wonderful young men.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They were Russians. They were not from any of these countries,' Turnbull responds. 'They were from wherever they were,' Trump tells him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Turnbull explains that the refugees are part of a trade. Australia agreed to accept Central American migrants Obama really wanted to relocate in exchange for the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am a highly transactional businessman like you and I know the deal has to work for both sides,' Turnbull says. 'Now Obama thought this deal worked for him and he drove a hard bargain with us - that it was agreed with Obama more than a year ago in the Oval Office, long before the election. The principles of the deal were agreed to.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is just before the end of the call, where Trump first says he's going to get 'killed,' then declares that he had a more pleasant exchange with Putin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Trump met with Turnbull in May, he was careful to play down the tensions. He even told Turnbull in front of the cameras that he thought Australia has a better health system that the United States - a comment that also caused him problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump said to Turnbull in dinner remarks that night, 'We had a nice phone call, right?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Now the record is straight -- we had a very nice phone call.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted the talk was 'a little testy, but that's OK' and said he was 'very proud of that relationship.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. president had arrived hours late in New York after holding an impromptu celebration in the White House's Rose Garden with House Republicans. They had just passed an Obamacare repeal bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That legislation did not make it out of the Senate, and lawmakers are still haggling over a health care deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capping off its highly anticipated week of awards, the Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce its annual Peace Prize on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coveted prize is given to a person, or group of people, who have &quot;done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations&quot;. The committee reportedly receives more than 200 nominations a year, though only a select group of people - such as politicians, committee members, and Peace Prize laureates - are allowed to nominate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee has received some questionable nominations this year - both the US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are said to have been nominated - but various organisations have whittled them down to a more realistic list of front runners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobel Prize in Literature 2017: English author Kazuo Ishiguro wins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topping the list is Pope Francis, who has been favoured to win since he became head of the Catholic church in 2013. No pontiff has ever won the prize, but Pope Francis has distinguished himself for his progressive viewpoints and strong statements on climate change and refugees. One British betting company told TIME that Francis received more bets than any other candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the committee is looking to reward work with refugees, they have several strong contenders. The UN Refugee Agency and High Commissioner Filippo Grandi are obvious nominees, given their work on the international refugee crisis. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who opened her country to more than one million refugees and migrants, is an outside contender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis greets the faithful in Cartagena, Colombia (Alberto Pizzoli/Pool via AP)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Peace Research Institute Oslo, which maintains a popular list of Peace Prize favourites, is betting on two architects of the Iran nuclear deal: Mohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister of Iran, and Federica Mogherini, a High Representative of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2015 agreement ended a 12-year international diplomatic crisis over Iran's nuclear weapons programme. After 20 months of deliberations, the country agreed to get rid of their uranium stockpile and allow international observers to oversee their nuclear programme. Awarding the Peace Prize to the deal's authors would reward these efforts while sending a strong message to Mr Trump, who is reportedly planning to decertify the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Committee is serious about reaching Mr Trump, however, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has suggested awarding the prize to the American Civil Liberties Union. The nonprofit advocacy group has mounted some of the most effective legal challenges to Mr Trump's policies since he took office, and have seen a surge in donations in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Chelsea Manning poses with an ACLU sign ACLU/Twitter)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee may choose to target to another world leader, however, by awarding the prize to Turkish journalist Can D&uuml;ndar. The former editor of Turkey's Cumhuriyet newspaper, Mr D&uuml;ndarwas convicted of espionage and aiding a terrorist group due to his groundbreaking reporting. He currently lives in exile in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen of Mr D&uuml;ndar's former Cumhuriyet co-workers have also been put on trial for aiding a terrorist organisation. Awarding the prize to Mr D&uuml;ndar, or Cumhuriyet as a whole, would be a strong rebuke of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's media crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another journalist floated for the prize is Raif Badawi, a Saudi writer who was arrested in June 2012 for &quot;insulting Islam&quot; online and on television. He was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes, of which he has received 50. The award would send a similar message to the Saudi government about the importance of press freedoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rounding out list is one of last year's top contenders, the Syrian Civil Defence (better known as the White Hats). The group, nicknamed for the helmets they wear to protect themselves, rescues civilians in Syria from bombed-out buildings. They claim to have saved 99,000 people over course of the country's six-year civil war. While they were passed over for the prize last year, they've since had a poignant - and very convincing - documentary made about their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced at 10am BST on Friday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">614 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A US$ 200 million World Bank project will help Jordan expand access to early childhood education, and improve student assessment, teaching and learning conditions for Jordanian and Syrian refugee children.<BR><BR>The Education Reform Support Program was approved today by the World Bank Group's Board of Directors. The project will benefit approximately 700,000 Jordanian and Syrian refugee children. It will also help train more than 30,000 teachers across the Kingdom.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last two decades, Jordan made impressive strides in terms of school access, attainment and enrolment rates. The primary gross enrollment ratio increased from 71 percent in 1994 to 99 percent in 2010, and the transition rate to secondary school increased from 63 percent to 98 percent over the same period. Nevertheless, challenges remain on certain fronts. These have been further exacerbated by the influx of Syrian refugees. The expansion of education access to Syrian refugee children has stretched resources thin and constrained the ability to maintain and improve the quality of education.<BR><BR>'The Government of Jordan realized early on that keeping Syrian refugee children out of school would have detrimental impacts in the long-term on peace, stability and economic development,' said Saroj Kumar Jha, World Bank Mashreq Regional Director. The Government's commitment to protecting Syrian refugee children's right to education and integrating them in the public formal sector has put severe strains on the country's fiscal balance and ability to deliver public services, The World Bank is committed to helping Jordan improve the access and quality of education to achieve the full potential of educational investments.'<BR><BR>In spite of steady improvements over the past few years, a key challenge facing the education system in Jordan is low access to quality early childhood education. This leads to poor school readiness, particularly for children from poorer and disadvantaged backgrounds, including Syrian refugee children. Poor student learning outcomes are also a challenge and are mostly attributable to the existing learning environment and teaching quality. One in five students in grade 2 cannot read a single word, while nearly half are unable to perform a single subtraction task correctly, thus lacking the basic skills for further mental development. Jordan also faces a major challenge regarding its student assessment system which does not provide early and effective feedback on performance.<BR><BR>'The Education Reform Support Program is well aligned with the government's National Strategy for Human Resource Development (2016-2025) and supports four of its five main themes: expanding access and improving quality of early childhood education; improving teaching and learning conditions; reforming student assessment and certification system and strengthening education system management.' said Karine Pezzani, World Bank Senior Operations Officer and Co-Task Team Leader.<BR><BR>The US$ 200 million Education Reform Support Program is financed at 25% from the Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF). The Program brings the World Bank Group's total commitments to Jordan to US$ 1.060 billion, of which US$ 890 million is on concessional terms with funding from the GCFF and the International Development Association (IDA). Launched in 2016, the GCFF provides concessional financing to middle income countries hosting large numbers of refugees at rates usually reserved for the poorest countries.<BR><BR>Contacts<BR><BR>Washington<BR><BR>Ashraf Al-Saeed<BR><BR>(202) 473-1187<BR><BR>aalsaeed@worldbank.org<BR><BR>Beirut<BR><BR>Zeina El Khalil<BR><BR>(961) 1-962-954<BR><BR>zelkhalil@worldbank.org<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The filmmaker's father Arif was only 12 when he was caught up in the sectarian violence of the 1947 partition of India, in which a million people died and 15million were displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last four years, Rohingya, a centuries-old Muslim minority group in Myanmar, have been subjected to ethnic cleansing by the country's army and extreme nationalist Buddhist monks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half a million Rohingya have since poured into neighbouring Bangladesh, many accusing the army of mass killings, arsons and rapes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the United Nations said the speed and scale of the influx made it the world's fastest growing refugee crisis and a major humanitarian emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A comparison can be drawn with the murder and turmoil which followed partition seven decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions fled their homes and were killed or attacked as they fled to the safety behind their new borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uzma, who recently made a BBC documentary on partition, said the pictures she researched for the film could easily be transposed with those of the Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;Seventy years have gone by and it is the same images all over again. The faces, even the clothes look the same. It made me realise I had to do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uzma spent two weeks on the Greek island of Lesbos cooking for hundreds of refugees who have fled there from war-torn areas including Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;It has been said that once you have looked a refugee in the eye, you will always want to help them. That's how I feel&quot; She has joined forces with Glasgow businessman and restaurateur Sanjay Majhu to organise All In For Rohingya, a cross-cultural charity event of music and entertainment to raise funds for the refugees in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be hosted by Still Game and River City actor Sanjeev Kohli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;In this 24/7 exposure to news, we can become inured to what is going on and dismiss it as another headline. But these are human beings. We should do something to help. That's what this event is about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 80,000 young Rohungya children may need treatment for malnutrition in western Myanmar, where the army have closed down food markets and restricted aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houses, fields, food stocks, crops and livestock have been destroyed by the army and marauding mobs of extremist Buddhists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the Rohingyas have walked for days, arriving in overcrowded makeshift camps in Bangladesh, sick, exhausted and in desperate need of food, water and medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money from the event will go to charities working on the ground to help the Rohingya, including Medecins Sans Frontieres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Music at the event is from Raag and Tonic, The Violet Kind and The Bhangra Beatles, who create a fantastic, infectious fusion of traditional Punjabi folk dance music and Beatles hits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmad uses Arabic sign language and Mountaha can't speak English, meaning they are struggling to learn how to communicate and get by in their new home country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Ahmad has recently started classes in British Sign Language (BSL), Mountaha is still waiting to start English classes five months after arriving in Birmingham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to new research by Refugee Action, refugees are now waiting up to three years to start learning English, as cuts in funding have left colleges struggling to meet the demand for classes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mountaha</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research has been released as part of the Jo Cox Loneliness Commission, which was established by the former Labour MP murdered last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Action, which polled the English language providers of more than 35,000 learners, said its study shows that current provisions are &quot;not fit for purpose&quot; with average waits for access to classes standing at six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said: &quot;Leaving refugees isolated and unable to start learning English is a huge barrier to integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A shared language prevents communities becoming alienated, and enables friendships and understanding to develop between people of different cultures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite living in the UK for nearly half a year, Mountaha says she hasn't been able to make any friends, something she desperately wants to change. While some classes are available in her area, she has been unable to access them because there are no additional services to help her with childcare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tried to have a conversation with my neighbour yesterday,&quot; Mountaha says. &quot;We tried to talk but couldn't understand each other. I felt very lonely and sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separated from friends and family, and isolated by a language barrier, loneliness can have a long-lasting impact on the mental health of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Loneliness itself isn't a mental health problem, but the two are often strongly connected,&quot; Vicki Nash, head of policy and campaigns at mental health charity Mind told the </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supporting the mental health and wellbeing of vulnerable migrants in local areas is a big challenge facing commissioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmad worked in a deaf school in Aleppo, teaching children how to use sign language. He was a prominent and well-respected member of the deaf community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite trying to find work in Lebanon, the language barrier held Ahmad back and he found he was heavily discriminated against due to his disability. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmad's confidence was low by the time the family reached the UK. &quot;I felt isolated, and so I stayed at home,&quot; he remembers. He is now taking BSL lessons at Birmingham's Deaf Cultural Centre and feels optimistic about possibilities in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Little by little, if I can learn just a little bit and my knowledge grows, I'll be strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the research, women face the biggest barriers to learning, with 77 per cent of providers unable to provide childcare at all or enough to meet the needs of all those who want to learn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ahmad and the children were my first responsibility when we arrived,&quot; Mountaha explains. &quot;I couldn't leave him alone by himself, and without support I couldn't look to go to English classes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colleges and organisations that provide English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) classes say quality is crumbling under a dramatic decline in funding over recent years, with current levels less than half what was available eight years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority (80%) of providers with waiting lists said a lack of Government funding was the reason behind long delays for learners. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worsening state of ESOL provision in England comes despite a growing body of evidence - including the Government-commissioned Casey Review - finding that learning English is vital for effective integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one provider said: &quot;It's a Catch-22 situation - the Government complains that people who have come to live in this country aren't making enough effort to learn English, but there aren't sufficient classes for them to progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: &quot;We are committed to supporting all adults in England secure the English language skills they need for life and work. Adults who are granted refugee status are eligible for the same skills funding as any other English resident.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southeast Asia could &quot;pay the price&quot; of Islamic State supporters seeking to exploit the persecution of the Rohingya Muslim minority, Malaysia's defence minister has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin cautioned that Isil, who have been seeking to establish a bigger foothold in the region, could use the current crisis to recruit members of the Rohingya community who were left &quot;vulnerable and without a choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot leave them (the Rohingya) desperate and wanting, because if they are and they turn to these groups, countries in this region would have to pay the price,&quot; he said, according to the New Straits Times.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warning comes as Rohingya refugees continue to flee a brutal crackdown by the Burmese army, which human rights groups have accused of burning down villages and killing thousands of civilians since the end of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past two weeks an estimated 370,000 refugees have poured across the Bangladeshi border to take shelter in squalid refugee camps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of Britain and Sweden, the United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday after the organisation's human rights chief said that &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; is taking place .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslim-majority Malaysia, which already hosts over 100,000 Rohingya refugees&nbsp;from previous crises, and this week offered to take in even more, has been warning for months about the&nbsp;risk that Islamists could turn the plight of Rohingya terrorists into a jihadi rallying cry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaysia is already on edge after hundreds of Isil-affiliated miilitants invaded the southern city of Marawi in the Philippines, a regional neighbour. The two countries have pledged with nearby Indonesia to step up sea patrols to search for extremists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Malaysian think-tank Iman Research, Malaysian militants had already been recruiting Rohingya affected by&nbsp;the last&nbsp;mass exodus of the minority in October, and dispatching them to the Philippines for training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation that violence against the Rohingya had fuelled an outflow of refugees that could destabilise the region, warning that Isil would infiltrate the group if the violence did not stop.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, with no solution in sight for the unfolding humanitarian crisis, Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina toured refugee camps and urged Burma to take back hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian immigration minister has accused detainees - &quot;aided and abetted&quot; by advocates and the Greens - of attempting to force the government to change its policy through subterfuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Dutton released his statement on Tuesday as more than 600 men, a mix of refugees and asylum seekers,  refuse to leave the Manus Island detention centre, citing fears for their safety in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates, detainees and human rights organisations, as well as Greens, Labor, and independent politicians, have called for the closure not to proceed in the current manner. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton said the coalition government had a &quot;clear and consistent policy&quot; of refusing to allow people who sought asylum by boat to ever settle in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island detainees fear for safety after police squads armed 'like it's a war'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Six hundred men at the Manus Regional Processing Centre (RPC) in Papua New Guinea who attempted to enter Australia illegally via people smuggler's boats - now aided and abetted by so called 'advocates' and the Greens - are trying to force a change to that policy,&quot; he said. &quot;They will not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton echoed his department in disputing human rights group accounts that the alternative accommodation was not ready. He said it was safe and secure, and health and other services &quot;will be maintained&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed complaints by detainees and advocates about the current situation as &quot;nothing more than subterfuge&quot; and said there were &quot;reasonable alternative pathways&quot; for all detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those whose claims for asylum were rejected were in PNG illegally and should return home, he said. Refugees could settle in PNG under the 2013 agreement, apply for US resettlement, or move to Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton also accused the Greens Senator, Nick McKim, who was at the centre on Tuesday and expressed &quot;grave fears&quot; for the men, of giving detainees false information and using them &quot;for cheap political stunts to build his public profile&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Perth, the acting prime minister Julie Bishop said the government was in &quot;constant communication&quot; with PNG authorities, and refugees and asylum seekers would be &quot;guaranteed all appropriate services&quot; at the new accommodation units. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island: dark chapter of Australian immigration poised to close</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the regional processing centre on Manus Island will be closed and the PNG government has made alternative accommodation arrangements,&quot; she said. &quot;I understand the PNG government has made arrangements for all essential services to be available at the alternative accommodation - food, water, electricity and medical services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton's lengthy statement did not answer questions about Australia's financial and practical involvement on Manus beyond Tuesday. It made no reference to the PNG immigration minister, Petrus Thomas, and his declaration on Sunday that unsuccessful asylum claimants and refugees who refused to settle in PNG were the responsibility of Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas said PNG had &quot;no obligation&quot; to deal with them and Australia had to pursue third country options. On Tuesday he reportedly said the Australian government was yet to provide any clarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is PNG's position that as long as there is one individual from this arrangement that remains in PNG, Australia will continue to provide financial and other support to PNG to manage the persons transferred,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island detainees launch legal action over Australian centre's closure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labor immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, said: &quot;Peter Dutton's failure to answer basic questions about arrangements in PNG after the closure of the regional processing centre has fuelled refugees' uncertainty. Transferring refugees from one centre to another is not a long term solution. These people urgently need viable third-country resettlement options.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor senator Lisa Singh said the situation was a &quot;humanitarian crisis the government has created on its own&quot; and they should have accepted an offer from New Zealand to resettle some refugees from Australia's offshore processing centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia has a duty of care to protect these vulnerable men. There may be more deaths if the Australian government does not resolve the dangerous situation it is creating today by closing its detention centre unilaterally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot understand how New Zealand does not fit with a regional resettlement framework. They are our neighbours and are willing to help settle these refugees,&quot; she told the Guardian. &quot;Now that Australia has been elected to the UN Human Rights Council, we need to start practicing what we preach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detainees on Manus Island have been told they face &quot;removal from an active PNG military base&quot; if they refuse to leave the detention centre after 5pm, and locals told Amnesty International that police squads have armed themselves &quot;like they are going to war&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiple accounts from detainees, locals, and observers say the situation on the ground has been exacerbated by a lack of consultation and communication. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manus residents have protested against the construction of accommodation units for refugees on private land in communities, without consultation. They have also expressed fear at large numbers of refugees joining the small community, and questioned what support will be given.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Nick Mulvey is back and preparing to release his new album</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wake Up Now,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the follow-up to his 2014debut</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's released three singles so far: &quot;Unconditional&quot;, &quot;Mountain to Move&quot; and &quot;Myela&quot; - the latter of which now has a striking video to accompany it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was produced with animation company BlinkInk and directed by MajidAdin, an Iranian refugee who lived in the Calais Jungle for six months. It draws on his personal experience after fleeing his home, travelling across Europe and coming to direct a music video for Elton John after winning a global competition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch the video premiere for &quot;Myela&quot; below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q&amp;A with Nick Mulvey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tell us about &quot;Myela&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee crisis was something I couldn't look away from. I felt I needed to do something, anything, to help and I also just needed to express my sorrow. I wrote this song in collaboration with musician friend Federico Bruno. Neither of us felt particularly worthy to write our own poetry about this situation - how could we pretend to understand the level of uncertainty that refugees must experience?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we decided instead to explore firsthand accounts of refugees journeys and draw the lyrics from there. We wanted to give these stories a voice. We wanted to create work that would humanise them. A twelve-year-old boy from Nigeria called Deo Gratias said the lines 'I'd rather die once in the sea than dying slowly every day that I stay'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did the collaboration with Majid Adin come about?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We partnered with Help Refugees UK on the release of this song (all profits the song generates go to them). They invited us to go to Calais to see the continuing situation there, meet some of the refugees and see for ourselves the work that they are doing there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst there, several people said 'Majid should do the video for this song! Have you seen his work?' He created the official video for Elton John's &quot;Rocket Man&quot; and wewere blown away by his visual re-telling of this song as an account of a refugees journey. We knew he'd be perfect to help with the Myela video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What have you been up to since we last saw you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I moved out of the city, became a father, and wrote and recorded my new album - Wake Up Now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asides from the album release, what are your plans for the rest of the year?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've also got a dream to create 'immersive' versions of some of the album tracks and its becoming a plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea is to reimagine the material as environments rather than songs and to reconfigure the recordings as such, so you can 'enter' the track, inhabit it and walk around within it... The location will be something very special and the people I'm working with are geniuses. Watch this space...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What should fans expect from the new album?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a new level for me. The recordings have quite a live feel, recorded with a group of musician friends all together. The songs are about big subjects, they don't shy away from some hard topics like the refugee crisis, but ultimately, they celebrate the joy of being alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You must be looking forward to your UK tour - how did the festivals go this summer?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summer festivals have been fun- it's good to be out playing again- but I gotta say, I'm looking forward to having a soundcheck! Festivals are quite hectic- turn up, plug in and play- so having a degree more control at venues with our own crowd will be a welcome thing. It's a new band, they're all amazing players, and I'm itching to share this with the fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wake Up Now is set for release via Fiction Records on 8 September - pre-order now</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Katy Fallon</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDUCATION; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">918 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A half pipe may seem an unlikely hero in the refugee crisis; but with the help of a few skateboards, a charity in Athens is breaking down gender and culture barriers amongst the children living in Greek refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project was set up in early 2017 by two British volunteers, Will Ascott and Ruby Mateja, who met volunteering at 'SkatePal', a charity which teaches skateboarding to children in the West Bank. 'We both went along and taught skateboarding there for a month and saw the amazing effects it had on this whole community,' says Ruby, 'we spoke at the time about how there were plenty of places which could benefit from something similar.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few months later Will was chopping vegetables in the kitchen at KHORA, a community centre in Athens working with refugees, when he got to speaking to a girl next to him. He mentioned that he'd like to set up a skate charity. She happened to be Josie Naughton, the founder of the charity 'Help Refugees'. 'She said come back at me with a formed written proposal,' says Will and a few months later, with funding from 'Help Refugees', he had had enlisted Ruby and both were in Athens building a portable skate park in their living room.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, over six months down the line, ' Free Movement Skateboarding ' is in full swing and most days will see the team unpacking their half pipes and ramps at camps around Athens and squares in the city. 'We teach at a basketball court five minutes up from out flat and there are people from everywhere: North Africa, Syria, Afghanistan,' says Ruby, who remarks on the varied demographic, 'lots of Greeks kids are skating now and boys and girls of different ages...it's amazing.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They now have regulars at all the sessions and emphasise the egalitarian nature of the sport. 'I know I say this a lot but there is no winning or losing in skateboarding,' says Ruby. 'We are trying to create this positive skate park culture,' adds Will, 'so that everyone's on the same level and everyone cheers for everyone when they learn something new.' He points out the benefits of skateboarding for children, refugee or not, 'it normalises failure because you relentlessly try the same thing over and over again.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chance to do some physical exercise is also important for the children&nbsp;who may be cooped up in small rooms all day; and they begin every session with a yoga warm up. 'We actually do have to deal with pretty serious difficult challenging behaviours all the time,' says Will, who has taught in a British school. He suggests that skateboarding offers the children, many of whom are dealing with varying levels of trauma, a chance to let off steam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the younger children mix freely regardless of gender, the older teenage girls generally don't attend. Ruby and Will are now looking to expand and build a permanent indoor skate park, which will enable them to, among&nbsp;other things, hold all female-sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For the girls that are older, that will be the safe enclosed space that they need, to sort of come and feel comfortable on their own and to be surrounded by women, it's quite hard to do girls-only sessions when you are doing open sessions in public,' says Ruby who is keen to see this happen. 'I think the girls skateboarding thing is at a really exciting place at the moment, people are really excited to see more and more girls skating.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They both hope that even if the children they teach are granted asylum elsewhere in Europe, they will continue to skate. 'We know there's a kid who is going to go to Barcelona sooner or later,' says Will, 'we've got people there who can hook him up into the skate scene and I just think &quot;what an incredible thing to be welcomed into&quot;, as you feel completely intimidated walking into a new place, like just a massive community who will sort you out.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The local skate scene is so supportive of our project as well,' says Will, 'it's the kind of thing you wouldn't get from another city because it is so close knit here.' Integration is an issue, not only with the Greek population but also within the refugee community itself, which is comprised of many different nationalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a session in the local square, Ruby and Will have noticed how freely the children mix regardless of which country they come from. 'There's a school right next to it so when the kids finish they come and we've had more and more Greek kids skating every week,' says Ruby, 'the parents are present and are really excited and encouraging.' The project is also looking to employ more Greeks as a way of investing in a community that has been stricken by a severe economic crisis and where around half of those under twenty-five are unemployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst the drudgery of a refugee camp, where the children are constantly reminded that they are refugees, skateboarding is a chance to be part of something where they can escape labels. Will and Ruby hope, funds permitting, to open their indoor space next year and give a permanent home to their skate park. They also plan to team up with a couple of other services in Athens offering training and apprenticeships to young refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often perceived as the domain of the non-conformers, there is something appropriate about the skate-scene now offering a lifeline to those who just want to fit in. 'My own personal feeling about the skating thing is that you think, &quot;oh it's just messing around&quot;,' says Will, 'but then I deeply believe that it gives so much more than that.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     You can find out more about the project here .                   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1063 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excerpt from report by Khalid Boudia entitled &quot;Algeria refuses to play the role of a policeman along its borders&quot;  in privately-owned Algerian newspaper El-Khabar website on 13 December - subheadings as published</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algeria conveyed at the UN rostrum its refusal of European countries &quot;playing the role of a policeman for Europe along its border and believes that the stability and perseverance of illegal migrants in their countries of origin is the solution which would be achieved through thought-out projects with the support of local residents&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report submitted to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Algeria objected to &quot;countries providing budgets in order to appear as though their conscience is clear regarding illegal migration when 75 per cent of the budgets go to non-governmental organisations, including European organisations, under a convincing working format allocated to logistical, administrative and travel expenses&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algeria is the destination </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said that Algeria had &quot;in recent years become a destination for migrants because of the restrictions imposed by Europe. The unprecedented influx of migrants, especially from countries south of the great Sahara, is attributed to the strategic position of the vast 7,011km land border with seven countries and the 1200km maritime border as well as work and settlement opportunities offered by Algeria, taking into consideration the political crises recently in Libya, the Sahel countries and Syria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, in order to face the influx, Algeria has adopted &quot;a stance of openness and tolerance in line with the Algerian people's traditions of hospitality and generosity and hosted tens of thousands of illegal migrants from south of the Sahara and taken responsibility for their welfare, treating them with dignity and providing them with security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prevention of the infiltration of terrorists amid migrants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the source, Algeria has also set in place &quot;measures to break up organised crime networks throughout the homeland in order to prevent the infiltration of terrorist elements. Those networks exploit the misery and distress of the migrants and force them into prostitution and use their children for begging and transporting drugs and other forms of illegal trading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report revealed that &quot;the great majority are economic migrants and refugees represent only a small percentage - they are under the care of the UN Higher Commission for Refugees. The office for stateless people and refugees received 45 requests for refugee status; Syrians, Libyans, Yemenis and people from Central Africa were among those who had made requests for refugee status to the UNHCR representation in Algiers. Syrian citizens, with an estimated presence of 45,000, are not considered as refugees because they come under the restricted residence system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algeria support the return of migrants to their countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, Algeria supports the &quot;voluntary return of illegal migrants to their countries of origin and in that context and in coordination with UN agencies it initiated a process of their repatriation in coordination with the consulates of their countries of origin by repatriating people who had been begging to their homelands. The process cost the Algerian treasury more than 20m US dollars&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algeria stressed that &quot;the competent authorities implemented the process in harmony with the countries of origin in complete transparency, particularly as a result of repeated attacks on public order and grave violations perpetrated by illegal migrants in many areas of this country which inadvertently led to malicious remarks aimed at distorting the image of traditional hospitality of the Algerian people and Algeria's natural solidarity with neighbouring countries which face security, economic, social and ecological crises&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draft law on the status of refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, the Algerian authorities admitted in their report that &quot;tens of thousands of illegal migrants from south of the great Sahara are in Algeria and, unless they engage in activities which are incompatible with public order and security, Algeria has no concern about them and is tolerant with those who work in many sectors such as agriculture, housing, public works and services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algeria believes that: &quot;like any other country, Algeria cannot accept for its territory to become a place where criminal activities are widespread. All those who abuse this hospitality will be subject to the severity of the law. This situation has compelled the Algerian authorities to initiate a joint process among the ministries aimed at drafting a final text of a bill concerning the status of refugees and stateless people in Algeria, taking into consideration various international protocols concerning protection which have been endorsed by Algeria and regarding which the UNHCR offered technical help and legal expertise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, getting medical care in Algeria had become a right that is constitutional, international, unbiased and without discrimination. [Passage omitted: More in the same vein]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitality is not dictated by political agenda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, Algeria's &quot;generous policy&quot; extends to education, whereby children of illegal migrants from south of the Sahara may attend schools. According to the source, this policy aims at &quot;keeping them away from being used for all kinds of ends, such as begging in streets. In the event of fathers who may be under the influence of criminal networks and use all kinds of tricks to avoid sending their children to school, the authorities would have to repatriate them to their countries of origin after consular authorities ascertain their identities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report ends with Algeria stressing that it &quot;remains the land of hospitality and is well aware of the challenges which neighbouring countries face and expresses its multi-faceted solidarity with the national courses of national reconciliation and development. This stance is not dictated by any political agenda, it is a manifestation of the generosity of the Algerian people who have never abandoned their commitment to solidarity and justice with others. In this context and since we submitted our last report 27 people have been sentenced for making racist remarks and insults in seven cases dealt with by courts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a Bangladeshi lent him money for the chillies, which he sells for 200 taka (&pound;1.80) per kg, higher than the local market price of 130 taka per kg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladeshi traders sell plum at a stall in the camp, one pot costing 9p (Reuters)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have the money to take lots of food, that's why I have to take a loan,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to pay more to the lender who gave me the money to buy the vegetables, so there is only a small profit,&quot; said Fayaj, adding he takes home 100 taka a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obaidul Mannan, 40, with five daughters and two sons, traded clocks in Myanmar until the military came to his village, arresting people and burning homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He now sells betel nut that he bought with 9 grams of gold that belonged to his wife. His complaints are common to shopkeepers everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem I'm facing here is that I'm selling next door to traders who are also selling the same items,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He used to transport goods in Myanmar, but was told that Rohingya could not own a business in Bangladesh. Ullah joined up with a local business owner and now sells snacks and red chillies in the camp for a daily wage of 100 taka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Bangladesh government officials confirmed that the refugees are not legally allowed to own businesses in the country since they are not citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are giving all kind of humanitarian assistance. They are not our citizens,&quot; said a senior home ministry official. &quot;The Myanmar government will have to take them back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is still best known in Britain for filling the turbine hall of Tate Modern with millions of &quot;sunflower seeds&quot; for a 2010 exhibition. These seeds all looked identical but actually were all hand-made, tiny pieces of porcelain with their own little grooves and idiosyncrasies. It is easy to be reminded of these seeds in his epic new feature documentary, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The film, shot in 23 countries, has several high angle shots of men, women and children in tented villages, or in boats, or in long files, walking down endless roads. They are among the 65 million refugees in the world today who have been forcibly displaced from their homes. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Ai Weiweiis telling some of their stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking the day after the world premiere at the Venice Festival, the 60-year-old Berlin-based artist proves a disconcerting interviewee. Before you can ask a question, he takes your photograph. He doesn't ask for permission and he doesn't explain his reasons for doing so. He's softly spoken and thoughtful in his responses to questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Ai Weiewei explains, began in very modest fashion. He likes to tackle new projects from a position of near ignorance; to &quot;come from zero&quot;, as &quot;innocent as a new born person&quot;. In this case, he had visited the Greek island of Lesbos with his son. They were on holiday when he saw scenes thatrendered him speechless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese artist Ai </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weiwei</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is still best known in Britain for filling the turbine hall of Tate Modern with millions of &quot;sunflower seeds&quot; for a 2010 exhibition (Getty)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are on this beautiful beach and then you see a dinghy boat, peacefully approaching the port right in front of us. I turned on my iPhone camera and started filming. What I saw was shocking and unbelievable -a baby being handed out (of the dinghy), women climbing out. There was nobody there to receive them. I started to hear their stories. They had to walk 70 hours to reach the point where they can register. They sleep on the road. They are sitting in the rain. That made me so curious. They (the refugees) are proud people. They have dignity. They're not beggars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene was like something &quot;out of cinema, not real life&quot;. The refugees arriving on the beach didn't speak the same language as the Greeks and couldn't communicate with them. It was as if they had arrived from Mars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei tried to make sense of what he was seeing but was too &quot;badly equipped&quot; to do so. He was, though, intensely curious. He comes from China, a &quot;communist country&quot; with limited horizons. He had grown up with little material wealth and with severe restrictions on freedom of expression. His father, the poet Ai Qing, had been badly mistreated during the Cultural Revolution and forced to spend 20 years in exile &quot;in a very remote area&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A beautiful but very haunting shot in the film of a pile discarded </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lifejackets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">used by refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now,here he was, in western Europe, in the cradle of ancient civilisation, watching people who had given up their homes to travel to somewhere &quot;totally foreign&quot;. He wanted to know why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So that started the film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei's method of telling the refugees' stories was pragmatic. He began by&quot;documenting the situation&quot;, and slowly planned his film, as his knowledge developed. He has made many art documentaries and human rights films that he shot &quot;guerrilla warfare&quot; style, posting them online so they could be seen immediately, but this was on an altogether grander scale. &quot;I am very used to it, very skilful at that, but to do a documentary to cover such a complex story...&quot; his voice tails off as he contemplates how daunting the task was. He was covering many different stories, some stretching back for generations (for example, the Gaza scenes) and some about refugees who have only very recently left their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation of his subjects was changing all the time. He needed to come up with a structure that would allow him to deal with so many shifting perspectives. That is where the idea of human flow came in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ai </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weiwei</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was on holiday in Lesbos, Greece, he saw boats with refugees arriving on the beach and started filming with his iPhone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in his own career, Ai Weiwei's situation was the polar opposite of those whose stories he tells. As a dissident artist in China, he spent time under house arrest and had his passport confiscated. He wasn't allowed to leave home. In </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he is following subjects who've been forced to leave home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does being deprived of the freedom to travel compare to having to travel in order to survive? It's a question he has asked himself. When he was growing up with his father in exile, his father told him to imagine that he had been born in the remote town where they were living. That was the best way of coping with the dislocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when refugees are accepted in a new community, they will rarely feel they belong. &quot;If a plant had been cut off like this, it would die. As humans, theyhave a very strong surviving nature. But, still, they will live in darkness for their whole life. Don't have the illusion they come for an economic reason,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody, for an economic reason, will risk their life.&quot; He tells heartbreaking stories about parents who send their children away to give them a better chance to survive. &quot;The boat comes down and you see people holding children who have no parents because theycan't afford to pay the smugglers. They let the children go first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tells heartbreaking stories about parents who send their children away to give them a better chance to survive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a touching and very intimate moment in </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in which Ai Weiwei cuts a refugee's hair. Wherever he went, he tried to show what he calls &quot;the human touch&quot;. The documentary captures the monotony of his subjects' lives: Their desperate quest to keep their phones dry and charged; their constant waiting; their anxiety; their desire to &quot;fix up a little bit&quot;. Cutting their hair helped with that -and besides, it was something he was good at. If he wasn't an artist and filmmaker, Ai Weiwei could probably have made a living as a barber. &quot;I've done haircuts for people since I was very young because we had no money. I had to cut for classmates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are &quot;proud people&quot;, he says. &quot;They have dignity. They are not beggars. They cometo survive. They are not asking for mercy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei was always struck by how these refugees would offer him food, although they had very little themselves. &quot;If you eat it, they have such a joy. You are part of them. What is humanity? Humanity means we identify each other through our actions.&quot; Sharing a meal, he suggests, is an expression of this humanity. &quot;It is in our blood, beyond our knowledge, beyond our wisdom. We have the same body temperature. We use eyes to look basically at the same images. When we are hungry and cold, we feel the same,&quot; he describes the links between the refugees and anyone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weiwei</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was always struck by how these refugees would offer him food, although they had very little themselves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> clearly cost a small fortune to make. Ai Weiwei made it in collaboration with big US film companies like Participant and Lionsgate. The starting point was just him and his camera. From there, the project grew and grew in scope.&quot;I tried to get as much knowledge about the topic as possible. It is a joy to learn. During the development, some investors heard of our topic, knew we were in need and moved in.&quot; He accepted their support but insisted on complete creative freedom. He believes these companies were as determined as he was to &quot;help the people in need&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a beautiful but very haunting shot in the film of a pile discarded lifejackets. It can't help but make you think of photographs of abandoned suitcases belonging to victims of the Holocaust. The image makes you pause, though. You wonder how Ai Weiwei reconciles his obvious desire to create striking and beautiful images at the same time that he is recording the horrific experiences of the refugees. Ask about this and he responds that he was determined to provide &quot;beauty in the most difficult situations; in tragedy and in crisis...That beauty is brutal because it is very indifferent,&quot; the artist concludes on a very sombre note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ai Weiwei will participate in a panel discussion, hosted by Channel 4 News' Jon Snow and including special guests, broadcast live from Milton Court Concert Hall, London to over 200 cinemas across the UK and Ireland following simultaneous screenings of 'Human Flow' on 4 December. 'Human Flow' is released on 8 December (humanflow.film)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine, if you will, a city the size of Birmingham with a population of a million or so. Now imagine that a disaster has befallen that metropolis, a brutal war that has caused its citizens to flee with little more than the clothes on their backs. Picture the lines of refugees heading west to find a place of safety, which they eventually find across the border in Wales. There, despite severe financial constraints, the million displaced people are met with warmth and generosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a science-fiction story. Substitute South Sudan for Birmingham and Wales for Uganda and you get an inkling of what is happening in one of the poorest parts of the world's poorest continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of refugees globally has not been higher since the end of the second world war and a million of them have crossed from South Sudan into Uganda, mostly into the West Nile district. In all, an estimated two million people have been displaced by the civil war and ethnic cleansing that has been raging in the world's newest country for the past four years. Approximately three quarters of South Sudan's children are out of school - the highest number in the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike many western countries, Uganda has not demonised the new arrivals. The government has given the refugees land and seeds in the belief that they will be better off making a new life for themselves than doing nothing in a camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around half a million of the refugees that have crossed the border into Uganda from South Sudan are children. They have been fleeing at the rate of one a minute for the past year, putting additional strain on an already stretched Ugandan education system. They are being educated, but only after a fashion, in classes of up to 150, without text books and by teachers who speak a different language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'The refugees are like our brothers': Uganda's example to the world - in pictures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western countries, including Britain, talk persuasively about how the only real way to reduce the flow of economic migrants out of Africa is to provide them with an incentive to stay where they are. That means providing them with hope, which in turn means giving them a decent start in life through a decently funded education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, expressed concern back in April that there were now two billion people living in parts of the world affected by fragility, conflict and violence. Kim predicted there would be serious consequences if the internet-fuelled aspirations of people living in developing countries were not met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, the South Sudan-Uganda refugee crisis is going to show whether these fine words mean anything. It is a test for donor governments, for the World Bank, for the United Nations and for the Global Partnership for Education, the international body that has the job of providing quality schooling for poor countries. Thus far, they have not exactly covered themselves in glory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Save the Children, donor governments have funded just 17% of the UN appeal for the South Sudan refugee response in Uganda this year. The UN appealed for $61.6m (&pound;46.8m) for the education emergency, of which only a small fraction has been provided. As the charity notes, there has been quite a contrast between the response of the Ugandan government and that of the rest of the world. Uganda's response has been extraordinarily generous. The response of the international community has &quot;bordered on the derisory&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make matters worse, a Save the Children report adds, the funding provided has been short-term, unpredictable and focused on individual projects. &quot;This has made it impossible for the government of Uganda, UN agencies and national and international NGOs to plan for what has all the hallmarks of a protracted and systemic crisis requiring a long-term, predictable finance to underpin a credible programme. In effect, the international community has turned its back on some of the world's most vulnerable children, leaving Uganda and host communities living in endemic poverty, to shoulder the responsibility alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fixing the problem would be relatively cheap: Save the Children estimates it would cost $132m a year for three and a half years to provide pre-primary, primary and secondary education for all the South Sudanese children living in Uganda. Given the numbers, this amounts to $152 per child annually - or less than $3 a week. Such a scheme would have the added benefits of employing refugee teachers from South Sudan and of strengthening the Uganda education system. At a time when aid spending is (rightly) filtered through the lens of whether it offers value for money, investing $500m in the education of South Sudanese refugee children is a colossal bargain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long-term funding sources are available. The World Bank has a special fund, the International Development Association, that provides grants and soft loans for the least developed countries. The IDA is replenished by donors on a three-yearly basis, 47 of whom agreed to provide $25bn for the current round of funding. A further $25bn is coming from the bank's own resources, with a third $25bn being raised from the global financial market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A welcome innovation in the new IDA round was the creation of a window for financing refugees and helping host country programmes. Some $2.5bn was set aside for precisely the sort of emergency that is happening in Uganda. It is time the bank pulled its finger out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, the Global Partnership for Education has money allocated for South Sudan that is not being spent. This is hardly surprising given that half a million South Sudanese children are in Uganda and perhaps a further half a million are in other neighbouring countries. The Global Partnership for Education does not normally do cross-border funding, but these are not normal circumstances. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     In May, the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, gave nearly 7,000 asylum seekers living in the Australian community a deadline of 1 October to apply for protection or be barred from ever applying. He described them as &quot;fake refugees&quot; and said they were bleeding Australian taxpayers of millions of dollars in welfare payments each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the asylum seekers had been living in Australia for several years, but had been barred from applying for protection by the minister until just months before the deadline was announced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Peter Dutton launches extraordinary attack on 'economic refugees' sent to US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several thousand were already on waiting lists with legal advocacy services to assist with their applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister's announcement sparked furious activity within refugee legal services, aided by &quot;an army of lawyers&quot; who offered pro-bono services, philanthropic donations and community support, Tanya Jackson-Vaughan from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service in Sydney, told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've gone from providing about 25 free legal sessions a week to about 125. That's because we have been working seven days a week, nights, and we had an outpouring of pro-bono support from some of the top-tier law firms in Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're doing this on the smell of any oily rag, we hope that we've managed to assist most people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a day before the deadline, about 500 asylum seekers across the country have not lodged protection applications, most of those in Victoria and NSW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have not lodged, legal service providers say, are some of the most vulnerable asylum seekers, including people suffering acute mental health issues, those with a history of torture and trauma, and others who, because of language difficulties or other barriers, do not understand the legal process for formally applying for protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Peter Dutton refuses to say if Rohingya refugees being returned to Myanmar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half of those who have not applied are understood to be families with young children, including Rohingya families who fled Myanmar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are expected to recall what's happened to them, and to provide a coherent, chronological protection claim, but many of those we've seen coming into our office the past month or two, these are some of the most vulnerable. We've had Rohingya families with little kids, people who have really suffered and have struggled to survive in the Australian community because of their vulnerabilities,&quot; Jackson-Vaughan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our fear is that people with genuine claims, but who have a lack of awareness what this deadline means, won't be lodging an application, because they didn't realise that was required of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive director of Refugee Legal, David Manne said the deadline was &quot;arbitrary and unfair&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands of people were left in legal limbo for years without being allowed to apply for protection, desperately wanting to but not being allowed to, and then sent an arbitrary deadline of 1 October or risk of being deported to danger without even having their claim heard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manne said his organisation had massively scaled up its legal assistance, supported too by philanthropic donations, hundreds of volunteers and pro bono legal support. But cases were still coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia offers to pay Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the people we are talking about have fled from brutality, have been deeply traumatised and then suffered a second wave of suffering in limbo in Australia. One of the central reasons that some people are coming to us just before the deadline is that they are confused and frightened. And they are still coming. We will be helping anyone that needs it right up until midnight on 30 September.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Refugee Legal and Refugee Advice and Casework Service say they will remain open, over public holidays and weekends, to assist last-minute applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any move by the government to deport an asylum seeker without fully assessing their claim for protection would almost certainly be met by legal challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the asylum seekers subject to the 1 October deadline raised a prima facie protection claim when first interviewed upon arrival in Australia and so were &quot;screened in&quot; and allowed to live in the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An immigration department spokesperson said there was limited time for those who remained to apply either online or by mail for a Temporary Protection Visa or Safe Haven Enterprise Visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Failure to lodge a TPV or SHEV application will be taken as an indication that an IMA (illegal maritime arrival) no longer intends to seek protection in Australia,&quot; the department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IMAs who do not apply and who do not make arrangements to leave Australia may be detained and removed from Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since May, refugees lawyers and advocates have protested against the arbitrary and &quot;unreasonably tight&quot; deadline, but the government is concerned some of the cohort have lived in the community for several years without a deep analysis of their backgrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 7,000 asylum seekers who had not applied for protection when the deadline was announced are part of the so-called &quot;legacy caseload&quot; of about 30,000 asylum seekers who arrived by sea between late 2012 and early 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly 23,000 of that cohort had already applied for protection when the deadline was announced. Thousands are still waiting for their applications to be assessed, a process that could take years longer still.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVEN in the most idyllic of places it's often hard to escape the harsh realities of the world in which we live. Hiking along the Andalusian coast while on holiday recently, I would sometimes come across the remains of large rubber rafts, lying semi-submerged among the rocks and sand of an otherwise deserted cove. Just a few miles away across the Strait of Gibraltar sits the continent of Africa. It is so close that come nightfall, it's possible to see the harbour lights in the Moroccan port city of Tangier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Strait is a dangerous stretch of water, but this hasn't stopped many refugees from sub-Saharan Africa trying to make the crossing in the rafts that I found washed up on the Spanish shoreline.  These encounters would momentarily take me back to beaches on the Greek island of Kos. There, too, just a few years ago while covering the mass exodus of refugees attempting to reach Europe, I came across the detritus of these perilous journeys made by the displaced and desperate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll never forget the sight of endless heaps of orange &quot;life jackets&quot; abandoned on Kos's beaches. Many of the life jackets were fake, lined with nothing more than bubble wrap and sold by unscrupulous smugglers and people traffickers to unsuspecting families, many of whom unsurprisingly drowned during the crossing from Turkey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recall one night waiting on a beach for the latest arrivals of what had become near daily crossings. We had placed our car so that its headlights shone out from the shoreline into the water. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the night-time blackness we could pick out the pale, ghostly outline of a large upturned inflatable boat drifting on the waves of the Aegean. There was no sound, no voices save those of the small group of volunteers who had gathered on the beach with their flashlights trained on the water. One pointed to a small bundle floating on the current no more than 50 yards out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like the body of a child, a baby,&quot; someone said, their voice along with the hiss of waves lapping on to the shingle of the beach breaking the solemn silence. Sadly this was nothing unusual. More than once during that assignment the bodies of children and stories of those alive who had made the crossing would emerge. Many of these youngsters who had made it to Europe had already survived the horrors of war in places like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Many, too, had made the journey alone or with siblings. This was not something their parents wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, parents were faced with the most awful dilemma of choosing to send their children on the most dangerous of journeys in the hope of safety in a foreign country or having them continue to live in the shadow of war. Just ask yourself, what would you do? What choice would you make were the safety and wellbeing of your children under imminent threat from barrel bombs or the brutality of Islamic State jihadists in cities like Aleppo?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of these child refugees were granted the right to come to the UK, but some still find themselves stuck in the often-terrifying limbo of camps in the Greek islands and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their plight surfaced - albeit almost unnoticed - this week as it emerged that fewer than half of the 480 unaccompanied child refugees whom the Government pledged to house in the UK under the Dubs Amendment have actually arrived. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases children already granted the right to come have been waiting more than a year to transfer from Greece to the UK. Why is the Government dragging its heels on this? In response, of course, it says that it prefers to take unaccompanied refugee children directly from the affected regions of Syria and Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the fact remains that under the Dubs Amendment some children already in Europe were given the right to come to the UK. Any continuing delay in bringing them here only leaves them vulnerable, often at the mercy of traffickers and sexual exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This vulnerability is even more apparent in the case of those in Europe who have already fallen through the system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Oxfam, 28 children every single day are going missing in Italy alone, while numerous other charities and human rights groups cite reports of sexual assaults in official European refugee camps. Indeed, some camps are said to be so unsafe that youngsters are too terrified to leave their tents at night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given this terrible state of affairs, why then despite the Dubs Amendment and agreed transfer rights of some children to the UK should they continue to languish in such camps?  There is simply no justifiable excuse for the UK Government's lethargy on this issue, unless of course it's hoping the plight of child refugees will simply drop of the radar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern over the UK's Dubs obligation aside, the European refugee crisis continues to be one of the biggest moral tests and political stalemates of our generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember when those harrowing pictures of the flimsy rafts and their terrified occupants appeared almost nightly on our television screens? Well, where are those pictures now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the mass crossings from Turkey might have stopped, the movement of those coming across the Mediterranean from Libya, mainly refugees from sub-Saharan Africa, continues daily and takes a terrible toll. Already deaths on this longer and more treacherous Central Mediterranean route have passed the 2,300 mark, with next to nothing in the way of news coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As humanitarian group Save the Children has highlighted, this, too, is increasingly a children's issue. The number of children taking this route rose 76 per cent in 2016, while the numbers of children travelling alone more than doubled. Staggeringly, almost 93 per cent of child refugees currently being rescued from drowning in the Mediterranean are alone. Most are from sub-Saharan Africa, which perhaps only makes it easier for some to cynically ignore their plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For too long now the Aegean and Mediterranean have been the mass unmarked graves of refugee children. At the very least the UK Government should honour the pledge it made under the Dubs Amendment. It must ensure that without further delay those children who made it ashore in Europe are given the safety and sanctuary they were promised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">682 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza on 21 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Editorial by Bartosz T. Wielinski: &quot;Szydlo Scares Merkel&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Merkel, it is a moral duty to help refugees, while for Szydlo it is &quot;lunacy on the part of Brussels elites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Beata Szydlo is once again talking about refugees. This time she touched on the subject whilst speaking to TVP Info at a fire station in Chojnice. And once again she equated them with terrorists. Szydlo placed the moral blame for the attacks in Spain, where the Islamic State [ISIS] killed 14 people, on Chancellor Angela Merkel because &quot;she invited so many refugees to Europe and this benefitted those who are sowing death today.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is another manifestation of the Polish-German cold war that has been launched by the PiS [Law and Justice]. A few weeks ago, Jaroslaw Kaczynski announced that Germany owes Poland millions of dollars in reparations for World War II. Szydlo's remarks are a sign that the anti-German campaign is not dying down. This is because the latest message indicates that the Germans are not only responsible for millions of victims of the war, for which they have not been held financially accountable, but also for hundreds of contemporary victims of terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is also another manifestation of an amoral political game. Szydlo's words reveal a close kinship between the PiS and the populist parties of the West, which want to destroy the EU and borrow money for their campaigns in Russia. For Heinz-Christian Strache from the Austrian Freedom Party or Marine Le Pen from the French National Front, the German Chancellor is also the personification of the evil of the contemporary world. Meanwhile, over the past few months, the PiS has earnestly declared that it wants to strengthen the EU (although it is not doing anything to do so) and that it has absolutely nothing in common with European populists...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Szydlo wants to drown out her conscience. I know from German diplomats that in February 2016, during the Prime Minister's first visit to Berlin, Merkel had told her about the rationale behind the decision she had made six months earlier to accept everyone who sought asylum in Germany. Merkel, the daughter of a pastor, explained to the Polish Prime Minister what the Christian dimension of politics means to her and what it means to have a duty towards one's neighbours. She explained that one could not have left hundreds of thousands of people marching through the Balkans to fend for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Szydlo nodded her head in agreement but when she returned to Warsaw her government was already ramping up anti-refugee rhetoric and spreading a fear of foreigners among society. Szydlo repeatedly stated that Poland would not accept any refugees. For Szydlo, what Merkel treated as a moral duty was &quot;lunacy on the part of Brussels elites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PiS politicians demonstrate their religiosity but they deny help to those who need it. They use the formula of &quot;helping on the spot&quot; and claim (falsely, as it happens) that Poland has accepted a million refugees from Ukraine. At the same time, the PiS government is violating international law by not allowing Chechens who are squatting in Brest to submit asylum requests in Poland. The government is not reacting to the growing wave of racism and aggression, both physical and verbal, towards &quot;Pakis,&quot; refugees, immigrants, and tourists. What does this have to do with Christianity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the government's propaganda, every attack in Europe is an awaited opportunity to use refugees as a scarecrow, and for Prime Minister Szydlo it is an opportunity to yell as she recently did in the Sejm: &quot;Where are you going, Europe? Rise from your knees and awaken from lethargy. Otherwise you will cry over your children each day!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Szydlo also spoke of those who &quot;walk hand in hand with those who aim weapons against Europe?&quot; Was she thinking of Chancellor Merkel?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drowning out her Christian conscience comes easy to the Prime Minister. In the West, the Church would not put up with such hypocrisy, but in Poland it is silent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the refugees forced to flee their homelands due to war and persecution who make up the first ever team of displaced athletes to compete at the World Championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With &quot;no home, no flag and no national anthem&quot;, the five-strong squad competes under the banner of athletics' governing body, the IAAF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of them will be in action on Thursday with Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu, 18, and Rose Nathike Lokonyen, 22 - who both fled war in South Sudan as children - competing in the men's 1500m and women's 800m respectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are keen to remind fans that they are athletes in their own right and had to achieve minimum race times required by the IAAF to qualify for the championships. Angelina Nadi, 23, who raced in the women's 1500m heats on Friday, set a personal best while Ahmed Bashir Farah, 20, also achieved a personal record, finishing less than four tenths of a second behind the pack in the men's 800m heats on Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the competition, the team will return to their training camp home in the Ngong Hills, run by the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team was formed last February after founder and former long-distance runner Tegla Loroupe went into the Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps where they once lived and held trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night Kadar Omar Abdullahi , 21, raced his hero Mo Farah in the 5000m heats, keeping pace with the pack and setting a personal best of 14.32.67. Farah's time was 13.30.18, ensuring qualification in Saturday's final, his last race before retiring from the track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The athletes today told of wanting to inspire and highlight the plight of more than 65 million world-wide refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All were separated from their families at a young age, with some still not knowing what happened to their relatives. Nathike Lokonyen found out only last week that her aunt had died as a result of the war in South Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The athletes and coaches have travelled to London thanks to flights and accommodation paid for by the IAAF.More than 25 refugees at the training base attempted to make the minimum times, with just the five qualifying. A refugee team competed at last year's Rio Olympics, but this is the first time the five have competed at this level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founder Tegla Loroupe said: &quot;Before we came we were received very well in Kenya by the British embassy. They made it very easy for us to come and compete and already we were made to feel at home by the British.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team manager Ladislav Demko, 43, a former triathlete, said: &quot;Sport is a way out for them. When they step into the stadium, they don't feel like refugees any more. These people literally ran away on their feet from fear of death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed Bashir Farah, 20</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somalia, 800m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed Bashir Farah and his mother left Somalia when he was six and crossed the border into Kenya, where they found a home. But in 2014 his mother was deported, leaving him alone. Since then the athletics team has been like a family to the runner, who said: &quot;We left because of the government situation there; there was no peace. My life has changed now that I can compete and I can see Mo Farah. He is my hero. It's very emotional because I don't know where my family are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angelina Nadi, 23</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Sudan, 1500m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angelina Nadi was seven when she fled her native South Sudan. She has been in a refugee camp in Kenya since 2002. She said: &quot;I went with a [distant] relative because the war broke out. I followed them to get to safety and for a chance to go to school. From that moment I lost contact with them [my immediate family]. Everything was destroyed where our house was.&quot; She added: &quot;I now have hope that one day I will attain the level of some of the other athletes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu, 18</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Sudan, 1500m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu remembers soldiers storming his home in South Sudan before his family decided to flee the country's civil war. After becoming separated from his family, he found himself in an orphanage. He does not like to go into the detail of his hardship, but he eventually fled to a refugee camp in neighbouring Kenya where he met his teammates. He said: &quot;It has been difficult because my family dispersed and I have not seen my parents since I left. Running means I have a future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rose Nathike Lokonyen, 22</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Sudan, 800m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rose Nathike Lokonyen fled her home in South Sudan at the age of eight. She and her family went to a nearby town in 2002 but then she and her nine siblings became separated from her parents. They eventually made it across the border to Kenya. She said: &quot;I left home with my younger siblings but not my parents. It is horrible back home. I found out my aunt was killed last week. It is not safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she added: &quot;I feel very excited to be here in London. Sport has given me a better quality of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadar Omar Abdullahi, 21</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, 5000m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadar Omar Abdullahi left his native Ethiopia with his uncle and brother aged 13 and travelled to a refugee camp in Kenya, but does not wish to share his story. He said: &quot;Mo Farah is someone I Iook up to and one day I want to be like him. It was horrible growing up and I had a lot of challenges, but running is something that has given me hope. I don't know why we left home, but there is no fear now and I hope one day I will be a champion and that my dream will come true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee team also partnered with Swiss sports company On, who supplied them with running equipment, clothes to compete in for the championships and specialised training sessions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last asylum seekers have abandoned a closed immigration camp on Papua New Guinea, ending a three-week standoff between police and the hundreds of men who had remained there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Chief Superintendent Dominic Kakas said police and immigration officials had removed all 378 men from the male-only camp on Manus Island over two days and had taken them by bus to residences in the nearby town of Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the refugees had earlier refused to leave, and were prepared to suffer squalid conditions without power or running water rather than move to other accommodation where they feared violence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee advocates say officials used force and destroyed asylum seekers' belongings to make them leave Manus. Video was released of officials in the camp wielding batons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Water, power and food supplies ended when the Manus camp officially closed on October 31, based on the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court's ruling last year that Australia's policy of housing asylum seekers there was unconstitutional. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia pays Papua New Guinea, its nearest neighbour, and the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru to hold thousands of asylum seekers from Africa, the Middle East and Asia who have attempted to reach Australian shores by boat since mid-2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia will not settle any refugees who try to arrive by boat - a policy that the government says dissuades them from attempting the dangerous ocean crossing from Indonesia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The navy has also been turning back boats to keep them from reaching Australia since July 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before confirmation that Manus Island had been emptied, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull welcomed news that asylum seekers were leaving. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm pleased to say in terms of Manus, that the reports we have are that busloads of the people at Manus are leaving, they're complying with the lawful directions of the PNG authorities and moving to the alternative facilities available to them and that's as they should,&quot; Turnbull told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is precisely what you should do, if you're in a foreign country. You should comply with the laws of that other country,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shen Narayanasamy, activist group GetUp's rights campaigner, said in a statement: &quot;I awoke this morning to frantic phone calls from refugees on Manus screaming: 'Help, help, they are killing us'. It is astounding that refugees being beaten and dragged out to buses has the support of the Australian government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police maintain no force was used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton accused refugee advocates of making &quot;inaccurate and exaggerated claims of violence and injuries on Manus&quot; without providing evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton also accused asylum seekers of sabotaging backup generators and water infrastructure at the new accommodation provided by Australia in Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is clear is that there has been an organised attempt to provoke trouble and disrupt the new facilities,&quot; Dutton said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, said in a statement that its staff had heard troubling reports of forcible removal. UNHCR said it had been given assurances that excessive force had not been used, but could not independently confirm as staff had not been allowed full access to Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Costello, chief advocate of the Christian charity World Vision Australia, who is on Manus, said at least one of the three alternative camps in Lorengau was still under construction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were an Australian builder, you wouldn't let a civilian on to it, let alone move in,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was less than a quarter of a century ago that Rwandans would have faced the same plight as their own nation was in the grip of a genocide which saw as many as a million lives lost in just 100 days in 1994. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, it is Rwanda which is offering a sanctuary not only to those fleeing from Burundi, but to refugees escaping the long-running violence in another troubled neighbour, the Democratic Republic of Congo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here in the Mahama refugee camp, a glimmer of hope is being offered through cricket with a sport that is increasingly being used to define reconciliation in Rwanda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new charity, Cricket Builds Hope, has been launched to spread the sport across the country and bring about social change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sceptics may have reservations over such an apparently idealised approach, and claim that what Rwanda needs is investment in infrastructure and industry rather than sport. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to witness one of the first cricket demonstrations to be played at Mahama would help convince even the most stone-hearted of cynics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In front of 200 children who have never seen the game before, the captain of the Rwanda women's international team, Mary Maina, is introducing cricket to the masses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be about as far removed as anyone could imagine from the version that is about to be played this month as the Ashes gets under way at the Gabba in Brisbane, but the enthusiasm of the new recruits is infectious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four cones are set out with a plastic ball on top of each of them, and the batting team lines up to take turns in whacking them as far as they can. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100ft away, the fielding team congregates waiting for each ball to land while the batter sprints around a pair of wickets to score runs in a fusion of cricket and baseball. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scenes are endearingly chaotic, and the fun that the game is bringing to communities that have so little in the way of recreation is plain to see. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is step by step,&quot; says Mary, 24, who was herself introduced to cricket after watching a demonstration six years ago. &quot;There's the fun bit first - it helps you mobilise the kids so they want to come next time. Then you add skills one by one, and then hopefully a cricketer is born.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children who took part in the hour-long session give a refreshingly simple verdict on the game that many a professional cricketer could learn from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles, 13, who has lived at Mahama for two years had never seen cricket before, but said: &quot;It is easy, you just hit the ball.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tour of the camp shows the efforts that are under way to improve life for the 55,500 refugees who live there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education and recreational facilities have been introduced to provide the chance not only to learn, but also to help as a distraction from the harrowing psychological effects of having to flee your homeland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cricket is key to this, according to Joseph Kamuzinzi, the camp's protection assistant in charge of youth and sports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sport is about security, it gives them the chance to focus on something to help forget about the trauma and all the problems that refugees have. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It brings communities together, allowing them to make new friends and build relationships that help them cope,&quot; he adds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The session at the refugee camp offers a brief glimpse into how Cricket Builds Hope is aiming to introduce the sport to as wide an audience as possible and bring about social change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahama is remote and a four-hour journey from the capital, Kigali, the final hour of which is down a rutted dirt road. Its population has risen from 8,000 to 55,500 in the space of just two years as families flee the political instability of Burundi. Of its current population, 51 per cent are children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is exactly these communities that Cricket Builds Hope is looking to target, building on the work of its previous incarnation, the Rwanda Cricket Stadium Foundation, which has introduced the country's first international ground in the capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cricket, for instance, is being used to promote sexual health education and prevent the spread of HIV. Training sessions include the message that the stumps are the batter's life, and the bat is a condom to protect against the advancing ball, which is the disease. A simple metaphor, but one that is being used repeatedly across Rwanda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cricket Builds Hope project has international backing, including the UK-based Cricket Without Boundaries that has undertaken similar work elsewhere in Africa, and The Lord's Taverners, which has donated 1,000 items of kit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Taylors of Harrogate, the company behind Yorkshire Tea, is also playing its part in supporting a country that it has had close ties with for 50 years while purchasing some of the finest tea in the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yorkshire-based company has pledged &pound;90,000 over the next three years to promote cricket, building on the &pound;1m it has already invested in Rwanda since 2010 on social and environmental projects, such as introducing wells on tea estates to improve water supplies and encouraging farm diversification. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dom Dwight, the marketing manager at Yorkshire Tea, was among those who visited the Mahama refugee camp to witness firsthand the effects that cricket is having. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed money will continue to be made available for other schemes in Rwanda, but cricket is now a major focus for the firm, with plans to create a tournament, The Yorkshire Tea Tea Cup, within the next two to three years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to admit, I asked questions myself as to whether introducing a sport like cricket was the best way forward. But seeing the passion that it is bringing, it is obvious how important the sport can become,&quot; he says. &quot;The visit to the refugee camp has reinforced to me the benefits of the work that Cricket Builds Hope and organisations like the United Nations are doing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taylors can't take credit for what is happening in places like Mahama, but hopefully our support in other parts of Rwanda will help drive the whole initiative forward.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camp that has grown into city'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOCATED IN the Eastern Province of Rwanda, the vast size of the Mahama refugee camp means that it now ranks as the sixth largest settlement in the African nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 55,500 inhabitants, more than half of whom are children, the camp has become a de facto city, with health centres, education facilities including a school, a bus service and a market to promote small businesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees have fled neighbouring Burundi after violence erupted two years ago following the announcement that President Pierre Nkurunziza was to run for a third term. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahama is the sixth refugee camp to be established in Rwanda, with others accommodating those fleeing political unrest in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In The Yorkshire Post tomorrow, how Rwanda is looking to the future through cricket. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUPILS at Hermitage Academy could be heading to Westminster in the new year to present a petition calling for better rights for child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The members of the Academy's 'Rights Respecting School' group have already persuaded more than 450 staff and pupils at the school to sign their petition in support of UNICEF's 'OutRight' campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they have plans to spread their message beyond the school's gates by talking to family members, friends and members of the public in the coming weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group received a visit on Friday from their local MP, Brendan O'Hara, who said he fully supported both the petition and the wider campaign - and added that he would be happy to welcome members of the group to Westminster to deliver their message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group member Rosie Sumsion said; &quot;Many refugee children have to travel unaccompanied from conflict zones for hundreds or thousands of miles to reach safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want them to be able to travel safely with their families and then be able to live like normal children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our aim is to persuade the UK government to sit up and take responsibility for these children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think the problem is not that people don't care - it's that they don't know. Some people think refugees are just here to take our jobs and so on, but that's often because they don't know much about the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As human beings we have a responsibility for one another. These children are fleeing from people who want to kill them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are the future, but they are dying, and we have an opportunity, and a moral obligation, to help them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2017 'OutRight' campaign focuses on the rights of refugee children - and in particular their right to be reunited with their families in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the world, 50 million children have been uprooted from their homes, most forced to flee from violent conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is seeking to persuade the UK government to change its current laws, which require children fleeing war zones to reach Europe before being considered for reunification with their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK's current laws also don't recognise brothers or grandparents as family of refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'OutRight' campaign is based on Articles 10 and 22 of the UN Convention and the Rights of the Child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 10 requires governments to respond quickly and sympathetically if a child or their parents apply to live together in the same country, while Article 22 says governments must help reunite refugee children with their parents when they have become separated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months of awareness-raising by the OutRight campaign reached a climax with a day of celebration on World Children's Day, on November 20, when the Academy's petition was launched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindsay Purves, the group's 'lead teacher', added: &quot;We are the first Level 1 Rights Respecting School in Argyll and Bute and we have a responsibility to raise awareness of the Rights Respecting Schools movement so that other schools get on board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school attained Level 1 status in October and is now working towards its Level 2 award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr O'Hara told the pupils: &quot;Petitions are good in themselves but you can't stop there - you have to speak to your friends and your families and get them to speak to their friends and families to change understandings and perceptions of the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The recent decision by the UK Parliament not to accept 3,000 unaccompanied children into the UK was disgracefully voted down, and you are almost telling the government 'you're not speaking for me when you do these things'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Educating your peer group is vitally important, but don't let it stop at the gates of Hermitage Academy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll help make sure your petition reaches the Home Secretary, but it would be wonderful to see you bring it to London as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mass exodus of&nbsp;Rohingya&nbsp;Muslims fleeing Burma in just under three weeks is now triple the number of refugees who have tried to enter Europe across the Mediterranean so far this year, leaving aid agencies overwhelmed by the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 370,000 have escaped from Burma's northern Rakhine state to overcrowded Bangladeshi refugee camps since August 25, compared to 128,012 people seeking to cross the Mediterranean since January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International organizations have reported claims of human rights violations and summary executions allegedly carried out by the Myanmar armyCredit:      EPA     </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma's government has admitted that 176 out of 471 ethnic&nbsp;Rohingya&nbsp;villages are now empty.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general,on Wednesday&nbsp;called on authorities in Burma to end the violence against the&nbsp;Rohingya&nbsp;and acknowledged the situation there is best described as ethnic cleansing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the Rohingya fleeing the violence in Myanmar had travelled by boat to find refuge in neighbouring BangladeshCredit:      EPA     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The humanitarian situation in Burma was &quot;catastrophic,&quot; Mr Guterres said, and called on all countries to do what they could to supply aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burmese government said on Wednesday its leader, Aung San&nbsp;Suu&nbsp;Kyi, will skip next week's UN General Assembly meetings, and give a domestic speech to address the crisis, amid growing international outrage at her refusal to condemn the killings.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingyas&nbsp;have said their homes were set on fire and family members shot, slashed or burned to death. &quot;This is the fastest growing refugee crisis in the past five years, with serious human rights concerns,&quot; a UNHCR spokesperson told the Telegraph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya Refugees disembark from a boat at the shore of Naf riverCredit:      EPA     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Lom, a UN aid worker in Cox's Bazar, on the frontline of the humanitarian disaster, said people were &quot;very vulnerable, traumatised,&quot; while relief agencies struggled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UN agencies and the government were expecting the possibility that as many as 100,000 more people could come across when there were already 600,000&nbsp;Rohingyas&nbsp;in Bangladesh,&quot; he told UN News.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I don't think anyone expected a mass exodus like this, unprecedented in terms of value and speed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday one Red Cross mobile medical team at the makeshift Balukhali camp managed to treat 100 people suffering from diarrhoea, old bullet wounds and burns before its supplies ran out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No-one expected this explosion of people, and there is unfathomable need. It is beyond the capacity of international actors to scale up this fast,&quot; said Misada Saif of the International Committee of the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isolated rural locations with narrow, muddy roads, made worse by heavy rains and throngs of displaced people present major obstacles to supplying aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly desperate refugees, weak from hunger, are clambering onto the few trucks that do get through, trying to claim whatever supplies they can, causing fights to break out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Roland Oliphant: The scale of the Rohingya crisis 'is mindblowing'       00:56</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid that arrived by air earlier this week would not cover a tenth of refugee needs, said officials, estimating the relief effort would cost at least $77m [&pound;58m].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children being brought to an Action Against Hunger centre are being increasingly diagnosed as malnourished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One mother, Rozia Begum, arrived with her four infant children, after travelling for four days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had nothing to give my children, who were so hungry and thirsty they were crying. All I could do was give them river water to drink, even though I knew it was dirty and might make them sick,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Children 'burned alive' say Rohingya refugees       01:48</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another woman, Sara Khatun, grieving the murder of her husband and daughter, said she had been so desperate for food that she had eaten tree bark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of the humanitarian crisis has led to comparisons with the Rwandan exodus of 1994 when over two million people fled to neighbouring countries after a brutal genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's government on Tuesday expressed &quot;deep regret&quot; at the &quot;horrendous human suffering&quot; of the&nbsp;Rohingya, adding that it was &quot;very reminiscent of what happened in Rwanda in 1994 and in Bosnia Herzegovina in 1995.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, terrorist group Al Qaeda issued a statement warning Burma it would face &quot;punishment&quot; for its &quot;crimes&quot;, calling for Muslims across the region to help secure&nbsp;Rohingya&nbsp;rights &quot;by force.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRADFORD has become one of the first universities in the UK to be awarded &quot;University of Sanctuary&quot; status for its work dealing with refugees and asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The award recognises the University's work to create a culture of welcome and inclusion, and follows five years of work.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University's Sanctuary Working Group has been focused on training staff and developing learning packages to educate staff and students and helping to develop Sanctuary Scholarships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These scholarships help people who are seeking asylum, or those already granted refugee status, who cannot access student finance to pay student fees and participate in higher education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other initiatives that led to Bradford joining the national Universities of Sanctuary network include the Pennies in the Salary scheme, that contributes to a hardship fund, the provision of local allotment space for scholarship students, local asylum seekers and refugees speaking to students, and the creation of elements in the midwifery curriculum raising awareness of asylum seekers and refugees and their needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradford is already classed as a City of Sanctuary, and the University has developed strong links with this scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes encouraging students to take up volunteering opportunities to help welcome and support refugees and asylum seekers in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other universities to be given a University of Sanctuary title include the University of Sheffield, Dublin City University and the University of Warwick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee and asylum-seeking students often have major obstacles to overcome to get to university and afford the years of study there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story of Emily Wood particularly highlights this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally from Zimbabwe, Emily moved to South Africa after her house was burnt down and she was raped. She became a mother at 13 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;My uncle took us in. We stayed in South Africa, I went to uni, my child went to school. We grew up together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She just wanted to teach, but in 2002 her life in South Africa was upturned after the murder of her uncle. She added: &quot;My uncle was a politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When he was killed, I got a call to say I shouldn't go back to my house, and I travelled to the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She thought she would be in the country a couple of weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen years later she remains an asylum seeker and has yet to be given indefinite leave to remain in the UK. She heard about the Sanctuary Scholarship at the university and successfully applied, allowing her to pursue her studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is a now social work undergraduate and is combining her studies with a lead role in a touring theatre production Tanja, which tells the story of an asylum seeker</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Mel Cooper, chair of the Bradford University of Sanctuary working group, said: &quot;We're delighted to achieve University of Sanctuary status and particularly pleased that we are one of the first in the country to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have worked very hard to provide the help and support that we do for refugees and asylum seekers and it is testimony to that work that we have enabled 16 to be students here, more than anywhere else in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum seekers detained on islands in the Aegean Sea have described people setting themselves on fire, hanging themselves or cutting their wrists, with athird of those on Chios witnessing a suicide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The EU and Greece should take immediate action to address this silent crisis and prevent further harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of asylum seekers, including children, reported rising anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental illnesses as they wait months on end in &quot;horrific conditions&quot; to see whether they will be taken to the Greek mainland or deported to Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 26-year-old Syrian man, who has been detained on Lesbos for more than three months pending deportation, said he has attempted to kill himself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Greece(Reuters)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bilal said he was held in apolice station for two months, attempting suicide in a cell, before being taken to the notorious Moria camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this time [at the police station] I had seen no doctor,&quot; he said. &quot;Then I hurt myself in the police station, and then they brought me here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp, now used as a detention centre for asylum seekers to be transferred to Turkey, has seendeadly fires break out and had to be evacuated after tents froze in the winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrants being held there told HRW how they were being tormented by the wait to hear their fate, with anxiety compounded by delayed and changed meetings with authorities and a lack of information and interpreters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmad, a 20-year-old Syrian, was moved to Lesbos from Chios in May and does not know whether he will be sent back or onwards to Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm in a nervous situation,&quot; he said. &quot;Yesterday, an Algerian guy hurt himself [by cutting] ... my feelings are dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Families are among those detained in Moria, including a Kurdish woman from Syria with four children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My hope is dead since they brought me here,&quot; Rabiha Hadji told HRW. &quot;We saw all the terrible miseries in Syria but me and my children haven't seen a jail [until coming to Greece].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), which provides medical care on Lesbos and the island of Samos, hasreported a high prevalence of depression, anxietyand psychosis, and a significant increase in suicide attempts and self-harm this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee children being raped and forced into prostitution in Greece</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative said poor conditions in camps were a particular risk to former prisoners and torture victims, adding: &quot;For people who have experienced extreme violence in detention back in their countries of origin, a place surrounded by barbed wire, the presence of police, and violent clashes clearly cannot be a proper place for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amir, a 26-year-old Iranian asylum seeker who has been detained on Lesbos since April, said conditions in Moria constantly reminded him of prison in Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see the fences and I remember my past,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the first week I was here, I couldn't sleep all week ... I had nightmares of the torture I've been through in the military prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in Greece: &quot;Every day you die many times&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 13,000 asylum seekers are currently being held on Greek islands, where 9,500 more have arrived so far this year despite the threat of deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December, the EU and Greek authorities ended exemptions for vulnerable groups including unaccompanied children, pregnant women, disabled people and torture victims that previously protected them from detention in island camps, despite an appeal from 13 major NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU is now pressuring Greece to speed up asylum decisions and deportations to Turkey, where 1,200 people had been returned between the EU-Turkey deal coming into force in March 2016 and June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HRW warned that while lengthy procedures were worsening refugees' distress, &quot;length of asylum procedures should not be reduced at the expense of the quality of the process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has documented cases with a lack of capable interpreters during vital asylum interviews, &quot;serious gaps&quot; in access to information and legal help and authorities prioritising migrants according to nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice most commonly sees Syrians fast-tracked over Afghans, Iraqis, Bangladeshis and countries with low application success rates, fuelling tensions within camps that sometimes spill over into violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greek authorities, with EU support, should ensure asylum seekers have meaningful access to a fair and efficient asylum procedure based on individual claims, not nationality,&quot; a spokesperson for HRW said, urging Greece to end the policy of containment on its islands and transfer asylum seekers to the mainland, where children can be enrolled in school and adults can work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The EU and the Greek government should work to restore the dignity and humanity of people seeking protection, not foster conditions that cause psychological harm,&quot; Ms Cerimovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is the latest damning verdict of the EU-Turkey deal, which has seen the main refugee route to Europe switch from the comparatively shorter and safer Aegean Sea to the treacherous passage between Libya and Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement committed Turkeyto accept the return of most asylum seekers who travelled through its territory to Greek islands, in exchange for billions of euros in aid, visa liberalisation for Turkish citizens, and revived negotiations for Turkish accession to the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talks have since broken down over a series of rows over European nations banning Turkish referendum rallies, support for Kurdish groups in Syria and concerns over the crackdown following an attempted coup against Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research by Save the Children previously found the deal had dramatically reduced the number of refugees journeying over the Aegean Sea to Greece but had given people smugglers &quot;a firmer grip on a hugely profitable business&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study by Harvard University foundgirls as young as four had been raped in an Athens refugee camp, while asylum seekers elsewhere in the country were selling sex to raise money to be smuggled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ButEuropol hailed &quot;success&quot; against people smugglingafter setting up the European Migrant Smuggling Centre, identifying 17,500 suspected smugglers in 2016, intercepting messages, seizing documents and destroying boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year by sea, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, Bangladesh and Syria, with 2,300 dying in the attempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A baby's bright red bib emblazoned with the words &quot;My 1st Christmas Ever!&quot; Pyjama tops with sleeve ends intertwined like holding hands. A pair of jeans upside down as though their owner is falling from a height. Shoes, socks, mittens, hats. A long, winding, blue patterned scarf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are among 700 items of refugees' clothing salvaged from beaches and olive groves on the Greek island of Lesbos and hung in an installation by the British war artist Arabella Dorman in the nave of St James's church in Piccadilly, London. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorman has called her artwork Suspended, reflecting both the powerful and poignant display of clothing and the state of limbo experienced by hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict and misery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorman first visited Lesbos in 2015, after earlier spending time on the frontline in Iraq and Afghanistan. &quot;But nothing compared me for the human drama on those beaches. It was so shocking to see the level of trauma, especially among children, the innocents caught up in war,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were thousands of items of clothing discarded by refugees. I was struck by the concept of the empty garment, evoking the hidden presence of the person who had worn that item. These clothes reveal what is now being forgotten.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, the image of the body of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy, on a beach in Turkey focused global opinion on the plight of refugees. Now, said Dorman, &quot;there is a deepening and worsening crisis but it no longer occupies news headlines. People find it easy to turn away and forget - partly because they feel so helpless.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspended aims to bring the refugee crisis back into focus, particularly around Christmas, and to raise funds for the Starfish Foundation, a charity helping refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christmas can very easily be bankrupt of meaning,&quot; said the Rev Lucy Winkett, the rector of St James's. &quot;So as a church we're saying there's no better time to talk about this big issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christmas is a story of a child born into danger, it's a story of perilous journeys, fleeing persecution and violence, rootlessness. So when you see the children's clothes, baby clothes [in the installation], the link with the Christmas story is absolutely undeniable.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labour peer Alf Dubs, who arrived in Britain as a child refugee on the Kindertransport, said it was impossible not to be moved by Suspended. &quot;Every one of these items of clothing represents a life, it's very poignant.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on the government to honour its commitment under the Dubs amendment to provide safe passage to the UK for 480 unaccompanied minors living in refugee camps. To date, 202 children have been brought to the UK, including two from Greece this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's critical that we hold the government to account and ensure that we don't close the door now to children seeking sanctuary in our country,&quot; Lord Dubs said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every child that comes is a victory - it gives that child the chance of a decent life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit had &quot;set the clock back&quot;, he added. &quot;It's taken all the headlines and most of the energy of government ministers. The public has a short memory. So it's really important that faith organisations have been so solid on this issue.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorman said she had been &quot;ruminating on this project for two years - it's been a slow burn&quot;. She shipped 1,400 items of clothing in 27 boxes from Lesbos, and then selected those she felt told the most moving stories. All had to be dry-cleaned and made fire-retardent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've tried to convey the chaos, the explosion of people's lives. It's about the fragility and vulnerability of human beings,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, St James's hosted an earlier art installation by Dorman, Flight, which featured a refugee boat salvaged from Greece and hung in the church's nave. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not the church's job to write immigration policy, but it is our job to speak up for people who are suffering,&quot; said Winkett. &quot;So I don't mind at all being political with a small p. We're saying the government should take the Dubs children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspended will be on display until 8 February. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite being set in a Mallorcan villa (of unsurpassed tackiness), the language on Love Island is neither spanish nor english. Over the past two months, its mahogany-tanned, thong-sporting, ab-baring population has coined its own lexicon, captivating the nation and inspiring endless instagram memes and slogan t-shirts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the concept is this: an ever-changing roster of attractive british singletons (all graced with a comet's tail of social-media followers) is plonked on the spanish island on a quest for true love. if a couple do fall in love, and convince their fellow housemates (and the voting public) that they're the real deal, they will win a &pound;50,000 prize. the housemates all sleep on a row of double beds in a mixed dorm. And if you're not coupled up and therefore sleeping alone and forlorn on a sunlounger, you risk being booted off the show. More and more gorgeous young things arrive on the island weekly, competing for each other and for our attention. And what could be more relaxing than flopping on the sofa with a glass of wine and losing yourself in the mindless conversations of a group of beautiful twenty-somethings?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life on the island has some privations: housemates are apparently rationed to two glasses of wine a night, unless they're allowed out of the compound on a date in a restaurant, in which case all the others beg them to bring back booze. there's titillation in the form of the odd heaving duvet captured on infrared cameras, like something from Planet Earth. but really, the joy is in the complicated he-said-she-saids, pregnancy scares, break-ups and make-ups (or `couplings' and `uncouplings' as the producers call them), and a sexual tension you could cut with a knife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking over the shoulder of Gladys, a young South Sudanese refugee flicking through a frayed album of old family photos, my mind flashes back to my own younger self.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 18, I was in high school in California. I was responsible for my grades, for keeping my old Dodge running and helping clean the room I shared with my brothers. My great aspiration was to see Springsteen in concert one day. At 18, Gladys is a de facto mother to seven children. The war in South Sudan has forced her into looking after a brood of younger siblings and cousins. Gladys's own proximity to childhood appears a forgotten fact in the family, most irreversibly by Gladys herself. It falls on her to make sure the children get to their studies, despite the four-hour round trip from the Imvepi refugee settlement to the school. Her days are consumed with fetching water from a well, collecting firewood, making meals, cleaning inside the wooden-poles-and-tarpaulin shelter that UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, provided for the young family when they first arrived in northern Uganda in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gladys flips the pages of the album. I see families and homes that are no longer. Smiling faces from the past, a feast once laid out in a garden, a bygone birthday party, a graduation, picnics and weddings and children playing on porches. A photo of Gladys with her mother. Gladys's mother too is gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We sit perched on the side of a bed on which Gladys never sleeps. At night, she tucks in four of the younger children here, the other three on a mattress at the foot of the bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gladys sleeps on uncovered earth between bed and mattress, on the hard ground between brothers, sisters and cousins. Gladys speaks with hushed poise as she turns over each album page. She tells me she was dragged from a bus that was set on fire, with women still screaming, still inside. She was forced to watch people she knew hacked to death before her, one by one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gladys shrugs gently. She says she doesn't understand why she was allowed to live. We get up to leave the shelter. Outside, when I kneel to put my shoes back on, she smiles. She had said when inviting me in that taking them off wasn't necessary, waving shyly at the modesty of her home. Inside, everything points to human life derailed, everything a simulacrum of normalcy: the precious photoalbum, a few schoolbooks, a well-thumbed Bible, a crocheted blanket, a teddy bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking around, I spot things I have come to know well from previous travels with UNHCR, the `core relief items', kitchen set, jerrycans for water, a solar lamp under which the children do their homework at night, blankets, dry food rations, a hygiene kit of soap and sanitary pads. A starter pack for dignity. The basic blocks for rebuilding a life. The shelter may be spare, but it is Gladys's home, the place where she and the children sleep, eat, laugh, tell stories and secrets, squabble and make up. It is under its roof that they feel rooted and safe. Outside, I ask Gladys what her great aspiration is, remembering my own dreams of seeing The Boss live. Gladys says she hopes to find a job so that `I can take care of my brothers and sisters and make sure they have a good education in the future'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She laughs timidly. `My perfect job would be accounting.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back on the bumpy road out of Imvepi, heading for Adjumani on the other side of the White Nile, I can only marvel. At Gladys and her resolve. At all the other Gladyses coming across the border daily. The more than 75,000 children who have fled either unaccompanied or separated from their families from South Sudan and the civil war that has raged there since the end of 2013. At every border point, reception centre, or refugee settlement I visit here in Uganda, I find areas specially designated for them, the unaccompanied and separated children, the most vulnerable of the vulnerable. Two hours and a battering rainstorm later, we sit on the ferry to Adjumani. Dusk is lovely on the White Nile, the storm passed, the late sun dazzling in the water, the hump of a hippopotamus in the distance. But on the other side, the barbarity of the war in South Sudan rears its head once more. A UNHCR convoy is waiting to cross, on its way to Palorinya settlement. Inside the buses sit hundreds of refugees who, mere hours before, had crossed the border into Uganda having fled a new outbreak of violence in the town of Pajok. I watch them leaving the buses, boys still in school uniforms, mothers, exhausted, bewildered men. They gather in shocked silence in a clearing by the ferry dock to wait for their crossing. One of the men tells me that soldiers opened fire on the streets of Pajok, in hospitals, in schools. People dropped everything and ran. Those who could not the old, the infirm were slaughtered. Families scattered into the bush, he says. His family spent three days without food, living on wild roots, hiding and walking to the border. I look south sudan have crossed around me and see little in the way of belongings. into uganda Many here are barefoot. I pass a young mother end of 2013 breastfeeding, the infant only a week old. In the children spilling from these buses, I see the defining faces of the refugee crisis in South Sudan, Africa's largest and fastest growing. Over 1.9 million refugees have fled into neighbouring countries, nearly one million to Uganda. Most, 60 per cent, are children, frightened, confused, desperate for shelter and protection. I watch my colleagues interacting with the newly arrived refugees from Pajok, asking them questions, reassuring them that once they reach the reception centre, staff will help them with food, protection, water, shelter and medical care. I admire the work being done here on the front line of the crisis, even though, astonishingly, depressingly, UNHCR's South Sudan emergency appeal is currently only 17 per cent funded. I see in these busloads of refugees the urgent need for critical</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">funds. Not least because humanitarian organisations are supporting a refugee response model, here in Uganda, that is ambitious and visionary and should not be allowed to fail. This trip to Uganda differs from visits I have made to refugee operations in other countries. The most glaring difference here is the absence of fenced-off refugee camps. Rather, in remarkable acts of generosity and solidarity, individual and community landowners, as well as the government, donate land to the refugees. At the banks of the White Nile, as I watch the tired refugees from Pajok, I feel a little hope knowing that within a few days they will be allocated a plot of land on which to build their emergency shelter. They will be free to start cultivating crops there, in order to become less reliant on aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">efugees in Uganda are allowed to move freely, to access the same healthcare and education systems as nationals, and to work and own businesses. Uganda has its own painful history. It understands well that protracted war forces refugees to live in exile for years on average, often decades, and it has learnt that all parties are best served when refugees are incorporated into national development plans, instead of being viewed strictly through a humanitarian lens. Uganda's policy is not only progressive and compassionate, but also smart, as it helps better the lives of its own citizens. Take the case of Bidi Bidi, a small village in north Uganda that, in just nine months, has grown into one of the world's largest refugee settlements with over 272,000 inhabitants. Before the refugees arrived, there was no school here, no healthed south care centre, no graded roads. I sit under a tree e civil war with a local Ugandan farmer named Yahaya. He tells me that previously his youngest children weren't receiving an education, as the nearest primary school was a prohibitively long walk away. It used to take days to get his crops to market and back, he says, but with the new roads it now takes him a few hours. Yahaya has donated land through s are the the government scheme but also directly to refugees who have asked for extra land to cultivate. In this functional co-existence, made possible by Uganda's refugee policy, I see the power of pragmatic generosity. By the time we leave Bidi Bidi, I will have witnessed also the power of human generosity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">,000Aisha has big, kind eyes, a slender frame. She is 29, an abandoned wife, and mother to two boys, aged 13 and five. Last August, she fled South Sudan with her sons, a young niece and nephew. She tells me about a checkpoint stop, a soft tremble of indignation creeping into her voice, at which she was forced to kneel, her younger son in her arms, the barrel of a gun pointed at her head. Death was a breath away. In the end, the soldiers took her money and belongings. Aisha and the children arrived in northern Uganda with next to nothing to call their own. They received a UNHCR emergency shelter and Aisha quickly went about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">building a more permanent home from mud bricks she made herself, and thatching a roof south suda from grass that she collected from the bush, one are internall bushel a day. It was hard work, she says, but she and nearly t saw to it that the children were sheltered, fed, of them are (the highest clothed, enrolled in school. the world) When Aisha agreed to become a foster parent, the children were excited to have a new sibling to play with. But when Aisha met the foster child, she found that she was paralysed on the right side of her body and doubly incontinent. She had been abandoned by her own mother. She needed uninterrupted care. Aisha spent a night in prayer. In the morning, she knew. `I love her as my own now. But her condition is not easy,' Aisha says to me. `It is not easy for someone to accept her. But I cannot give up. Someone had to give her a home, somewhere safe to live.' She considered three names for the child: Gloria, Mercy, and Grace. She decided on Mercy, Aisha says, her fleeting smile an acknowledgment of the poetry of her choice. But if given the choice, grateful as she is to Uganda, Aisha would prefer to go home. Gladys told me the same thing. So does David, a former director of education in South Sudan, who now teaches refugee and Ugandan children in Nyumanzi Integrated Primary School. We are standing outside an empty classroom during his break time, talking about the school, when he pauses, his eyes going liquid. `Sometimes I wonder why God created me a refugee,' he says softly. `How long must I be a refugee? When can I go home and help my own people?' Every refugee I have met in Uganda, Chad, Jordan, Iraq, refugees from my own native Afghanistan has echoed this wish. Nothing can replace the deep sense of connection with your birthplace. But when going back to your own country isn't an option, home becomes the place where you feel a sense of belonging. A place where people don't look at you and say `you don't belong here'. And there are too many voices of fear in the world right now telling refugees they are not wanted. Ithink of a lovely moment that unfolds daily at the Koluba collection centre, where refugees are first brought for a hot meal and medical screening ahead of being allotted their land. Every morning, a representative from the Ugandan prime minister's office picks up a microphone and addresses them. Her smile is open. `You have come here to ensure the safety of your children,' she says. `They are the hope and they are the future. It's our wish that in your new home here you can make your children's dreams and aspirations come true. Welcome to Uganda.'

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Movements by sea from Libya to Europe, despite being the most dangerous route for reaching the continent, have increased and there are indications that it will likely continue to do so, a new study by the United Nations refugee agency has revealed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mixed Migration Trends in Libya: Changing Dynamics and Protection Challenges, a study commissioned by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), around half of those travelling to the country did so believing they could find jobs there, but ended up fleeing onwards to Europe to escape life-threatening insecurity, instability, difficult economic conditions and widespread exploitation and abuse.<BR><BR>&quot;Foreign nationals going to Libya are part of mixed migration flows, meaning that people with different backgrounds and motivations travel together along the same routes, often with the help of ruthless people smugglers and criminal gangs,&quot; said the UN agency in a news release today, announcing the findings.<BR><BR>&quot;They include refugees, asylum seekers, economic migrants, unaccompanied minors, environmental migrants, victims of trafficking and stranded migrants, among others.&quot;<BR><BR>The study also found that almost 80 per cent of the refugees and migrants in Libya were young men (80 per cent), aged 22 on average and travelling alone (72 per cent).<BR><BR>Of particular concern was the rise in number of unaccompanied and separated children travelling alone, now representing some 14 per cent of all arrivals in Europe via the Central Mediterranean route, as well as women, particularly those from West and Central Africa, who could be victims of trafficking.<BR><BR>Refugees and migrants in Libya also tended to have a low level of education, with 49 per cent having little or no formal education and only 16 per cent having received vocational training or higher education, noted the study.<BR><BR>It also revealed that while economic reasons was the major factor motivating people to travel, many were also trying to flee violence, conflict or political persecution in their countries of origin.<BR><BR>In addition from people from within the African continent, the refugees and migrants in Libya also included individuals from as far as Syria, Iraq and Bangladesh.<BR><BR>However, many arriving in the country risk being kidnapped, held captive and abused by human smugglers or criminal gangs.<BR><BR>RELATED: 'No limit' to cruelty of traffickers, says UN agency, as video surfaces of abused migrants in Libya<BR><BR>In the news release, UNHCR noted that conflict, instability and the collapse of the justice system and reigning impunity in Libya have contributed to an environment where human smuggling and criminal networks flourish.<BR><BR>In order to provide humanitarian assistance to those arriving as well as to the Libyans affected by the ongoing conflict, UNHCR is scaling up its response and recently issued an appeal for $ 75.5 million to strengthen protection monitoring and interventions, as well as advocacy on issues related to respect for human rights, access to basic services, asylum procedures and freedom of movement.<BR><BR>The UN agency is also stepping up efforts in Libya and the neighbouring countries to provide credible alternatives, find durable solutions and establish legal pathways for refugees and asylum seekers, as an alternative to dangerous trips to the country or over the Central Mediterranean Sea to Europe.<BR><BR>The study was commissioned by UNHCR and done by Altai Consulting, a specialised consulting firm that focuses on research, monitoring and evaluation in fragile states, and IMPACT Initiatives, a Geneva-based think-tank that assesses, monitors and evaluates aid programmes.<BR><BR>Its findings are primarily based on qualitative data - including interviews with refugees and migrants - collected in Libya, Algeria, Chad, Italy, Niger and Tunisia, between October and December 2016.<BR><BR>Let's block ads!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF was concerned about the health of the men who, after more than four years in detention, had eaten and drunk little for the last few weeks while living in unsanitary conditions. The men were also hit with bars by authorities during the removal operation, resulting in some minor injuries, and they alleged further beatings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conden said MSF had heard of some of the sick and injured men had been unable to access healthcare or were too afraid to leave their bed, and MSF called for access to visit them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said psychiatric concerns might be a &quot;very significant&quot; issue now given that prior to the standoff the men were believed to have been given a month's worth of medication to see them through the transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conden said he was concerned patients - particularly those with heart conditions and psychiatric illnesses - had now run out of medication. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF had also tried to access the health clinic set up for the refugees once they moved to Lorengau, but was again prevented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Health clinic staff] came to the gate one day, but that's the only meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said as he understood the clinic was only operational for limited hours during the day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have also been repeated claims of poor facilities and sanitation in the new accommodation units, which organisations such as MSF and the Australian Council for International Development have been prevented from accessing and verifying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF rarely speaks out publicly, but Conden said the situation called for it after the organisation had exhausted other options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've come to the conclusion that we're even more concerned about the medical state of these people, and it reached a point we were prepared to say we've done all the right things,&quot; said Conden.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF has joined the UNHCR, the Australian Council for International Development, Amnesty International, Oxfam and other human rights groups in criticising the &quot;humanitarian crisis&quot; on Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite pleas from the organisations and other governments including New Zealand, the Australian government has insisted the alternative accommodation is complete and refugees are simply trying to pressure it into bringing them to Australia. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Turnbull government has rejected offers from New Zealand to resettle 150 refugees, saying it wanted to see out a previously struck deal with the US, and that New Zealand resettlement would help restart the people-smuggling trade.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE population of the European Union has reached almost 512 million - with the ongoing migration crisis contributing to an increase of almost 1.5 million people in 2016, new figures reveal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU population grew by around 1.5 million in 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of January 1, the EU's total population stood at 511.8 million, up from 510.3 million the year before.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of births and the number of deaths were roughly equal, meaning that the population growth was largely down to net migration, according to a press release from the bloc's statistics agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Millions of migrants to arrive after EU's woeful response - warning  G20 leaders agree refugees should claim asylum in the first safe co... </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the population increased in 18 EU member states and decreased in 10, with Germany and Sweden - two of the biggest recipients of migrants in recent years - among the countries with the highest population increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany saw a net increase of 7.6 people per 1,000 inhabitants, while the population in Sweden increased by 14.5 people per 1,000 inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest population increase was found in Luxembourg, with 19.8 more inhabitants per 1,000 compared with the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EUROSTAT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This graph reveals which EU populations grew or shrunk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain saw a population rise of 6.5 per cent, or an estimated 426,000 people - and remains the EU's third most populous member behind Germany and France, home to 12.9 per cent of the total EU population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Croatia, Latvia and Lithuania reported the largest falls in population. Italy, Greece and Portugal also posted slight decreases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the World Economic Forum, around 370,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Europe in 2016, with more than 75,500 refugees and migrants left stranded in Greece and the western Balkans after Hungary and some other countries closed their borders to migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers crossing from Turkey to Greece fell sharply after the European Union struck a deal with Ankara in March in a bid to stem the flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of migrants arriving in Europe has dropped drastically compared with 2015, when around one million refugees and migrants came to the continent with many of them fleeing conflicts in their home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news comes after Theresa May told the Commons earlier today that leaders at the G20 summit in Hamburg agreed that &quot;refugees should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister said: &quot;On migration I expressed the UK's continued support for the scale of the challenge facing Italy, and agreed with prime minister Gentiloni that a UK expert Home Office and Department for International Development delegation will travel out to Italy to see how we can help further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we're leaving the European Union, as a global Britain we will continue to work closely with all our European partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May told MPs about her discussions with other world leaders at the G20 summit in Hamburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The G20 also agreed to use the upcoming negotiations on the UN global compacts to seek the comprehensive approach that the UK has been arguing for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This includes ensuring refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, improving the way we distinguish between refugees and economic migrants and developing a better overall approach to managing economic migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It also includes providing humanitarian and development to refugees in their own countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany is offering asylum seekers new fitted kitchens, bathrooms and a year's free rent if they go home, in the latest measure seeking to increase the return of refugees to their country of origin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cash incentive is marketed to refugees under the slogan &quot;Your country. Your future. Now!&quot; Immigration has become the main political issue as Germany tries to form a government after inconclusive elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Existing financial incentives of up to (EURO)1,200 each for refugees to leave Germany will be topped up by (EURO)3,000 for each family and (EURO)1,000 for individuals if they voluntarily return home over the next three months. The cash can be used for rent or home renovations in a desperate attempt to persuade refugees to leave of their own accord to reduce numbers and take the political heat out of the issue next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you voluntarily decide to return by the end of February, in addition to start-up help you can provisionally receive housing cost help for the first 12 months in your homeland,&quot; Thomas de Maizi&egrave;re, the German interior minister, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 8,639 migrants participated in the return programme between February and October this year even though there are 115,000 eligible rejected asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee organisations have attacked the latest financial incentive as bribery and an underhand strategy to persuade asylum seekers to give up their rights in return for cash. &quot;He's trying to entice people to give up their rights in the basest manner,&quot; G&uuml;nter Burkhardt, the head of Pro Asyl, said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elections in September were dominated by immigration and the rise of the nationalist anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, leaving a weakened Angela Merkel still trying to form a new coalition government after the first round of talks collapsed last month over the refugee question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversial measures to begin the deportation of Syrians - who arrived in their hundreds of thousands in 2015 - after the middle of 2018 have been tabled by regional governments controlled by Mrs Merkel's conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bavarian interior ministry, one of the regional governments that supports the measure, told Welt am Sonntag yesterday that Afghans who have been refused asylum tended to disappear days before their deportation flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of 50 Afghans at a time being sent home only an average of five people from each &quot;collective flight&quot; hand themselves in for deportation or can be found, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nationalist hardliner Alexander Gauland was elected leader of the AfD on Saturday alongside the more moderate J&ouml;rg Meuthen, suggesting that the AfD, which has 94 MPs in parliament, will continue to move towards the anti-immigrant right wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives of 12 people killed in the terrorist lorry attack on a Berlin Christmas market last year wrote that they had been &quot;left in the lurch&quot; by Mrs Merkel and attacked her &quot;political inaction&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a time when the threat posed by dangerous Islamists has greatly increased, you have failed to push ahead with expanding resources and reforming the confused official structures for fighting these dangers,&quot; they wrote in Der Spiegel magazine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis has demanded that the international community take &quot;decisive measures&quot; to resolve the causes of the mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, breaking his recent silence over what the United Nations has declared to be a textbook case of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving in Bangladesh from Myanmar, he said it also was &quot;imperative&quot; for world governments to immediately provide assistance to help the Bangladeshi government cope with Asia's worst refugee crisis in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech in front of Bangladesh president Abdul Hamid, government officials and ambassadors from around the world, Francis praised Bangladesh's sacrifice and generosity in welcoming in so many refugees &quot;before the eyes of the whole world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not identify the Rohingya by name, ethnicity or faith, referring only to &quot;refugees from Rakhine state&quot; but his words were sharp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of us can fail to be aware of the gravity of the situation, the immense toll of human suffering involved, and the precarious living conditions of so many of our brothers and sisters, a majority of whom are women and children, crowded in the refugee camps,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is imperative that the international community take decisive measures to address this grave crisis, not only by working to resolve the political issues that have led to the mass displacement of people, but also by offering immediate material assistance to Bangladesh in its effort to respond effectively to urgent human needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis, a tireless and fearless advocate for refugees, outcasts and society's most marginal, had drawn criticism from human rights organisations and Rohingya themselves for having failed to speak out publicly about their plight while he was in Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had remained silent out of diplomatic deference to his hosts, who consider the Rohingya as having illegally migrated from Bangladesh and do not recognise them as one of Myanmar's ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 620,000 Rohingya have fled Burma and poured into Bangladesh refugee camps over the last few months amid a scorched earth campaign by the Burmese military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vatican defended the Pope's silence, saying he wanted to &quot;build bridges&quot; with the predominantly Buddhist nation, which only recently established diplomatic relations with the Holy See.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesman Greg Burke said Francis took seriously the advice given to him by the local Catholic Church, which urged him to toe a cautious line and not refer to the Rohingya by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya have faced persecution and discrimination in Myanmar for decades and are denied citizenship, even though many families have lived there for generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation grew worse in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August when the army began what it called clearance operations in Rakhine state following attacks on security positions by a group of Rohingya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya living in camps in Bangladesh have described indiscriminate attacks by Myanmar security forces and Buddhist mobs, including killings, rapes and the torching of entire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh President Hamid accused Myanmar's military of having committed &quot;ruthless atrocities&quot; against the Muslims and, in his speech to Pope Francis, demanded international help to return them safely to Myanmar.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the glow of his phone, Benham Satah leads the way into the Manus Island &quot;regional processing centre&quot;, abandoned now by both the Australian and Papua New Guinean governments, and left to ruin and the resourcefulness of those left within.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The massive steel fences that have surrounded this place for years have been, in large part, pulled down, but in haste, and much of the perimeter lies half-dismantled, twisted and torn. Inside is decay and despair, but also defiance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks since the camp was shuttered and essential services withdrawn, the 400 men who remain inside are resolute in their determination to stay. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say they have spent nearly five years living with uncertainty of indefinite detention, and they are adamant there is no possible future - no safety - for them on Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they survive on increasingly meagre resources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a fraught underground supply chain of food and medicine coming into the camp from Manusians outside anxious to help. But it is ad hoc and vulnerable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phones, lifelines to the outside world, are kept charged via batteries dragged from one of the abandoned administrative blocks. Those are kept replenished by solar panels brought from another building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they come to take us by force, we will not fight back, we cannot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Benham Satah    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp is rotting in the muggy tropical heat. Refugees have been pulling apart the abandoned buildings, using the timber frames as firewood so that they can cook on earth stoves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The generators that powered the centre have been removed, and water lines cut. Other items of value and utility - fans, fridges, furniture - have been stolen by people from the surrounding military base or further outside. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The water in the jury-rigged wells the men have been dug has been deliberately spoiled. Rubbish and oil have been poured into them by PNG immigration officers sent in to encourage the men to leave. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papua New Guinea wants to reclaim the land where until recently it allowed the men - refugees and asylum seekers - to be held on behalf of Australia, which is refusing to resettle them. PNG police have brought officers from across the country to Manus to oversee the final shutdown. Thus far, there has been no force used against the men themselves, but shelters have been torn down, and pumps and pipes sabotaged so they can't be repaired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the men who remain in the camp have coalesced into an anarchic collective, co-operating to share the tasks of running the &quot;camp&quot; in the absence of anyone else here, and anywhere else to go. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say the abandonment has inspired a new unity among them. It is a resilience born of new agency: after four-and-a-half years at the whim of a capricious detention system, the men of Manus finally feel in charge of their lives again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I lost my memory in this place. I can't remember my past and I can't think about my future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ezatullah Kakar    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All our brothers here are contributing in whatever way they can to make life a little bit easier,&quot; Satah says. &quot;This situation has made us more closer, and more determined. Many of us have experienced war, and this is like a war. We are all together.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees have established a roster of men &quot;on watch&quot; guarding the perimeter of the camp, for any incursions, and people are assigned jobs based on their skills. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engineers have supervised the digging of the wells, and what little battery power can be generated is overseen by electricians. Others take charge of dispensing medicines and providing basic medical care. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone does what they can, what they have the ability to do,&quot; Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Muhamat tells the Guardian. &quot;And that way we help each other, because it's only us.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp sleeps in the day, to avoid Manus's relentless heat. While the 400 men who remain here are awake at night, there is little movement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are sick,&quot; Satah says. &quot;We are tired and we are hungry.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they come to take us by force, we will not fight back, we cannot, we are for peace. But that is the only way we will go.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly, the men sit without speaking, in small tight groups, their faces illuminated by the glow of their phones or the light of a fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some, however, prefer the darkness. One man sits in total silence in the very corner of one compound, his forehead resting against the pillar of the decrepit fence. He makes no sound. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In quiet pockets men are bathing, standing up, with water from buckets, others are pulling water from the re-dug wells. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees and asylum seekers who remain inside the Manus &quot;RPC&quot; live largely divided by nationality and language groups, though there appears little hostility to the divisions. In this polyglot refuge, English is the lingua franca. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over here is where the Tamils live,&quot; Satah says, nodding to the man standing in the darkened doorway. &quot;The Kurdish area is over here.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here,&quot; he says, reaching the top of a flight of stairs at M Block. &quot;This is where my roommate Reza Barati was murdered. &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 2014, in the midst of a riotous invasion of the centre from outside, Satah watched from the doorway as Barati was struck twice in the head with a stick spiked with nails, before a succession of guards kicked the prone Iranian and, finally, a rock was dropped on his head, the injury that ultimately killed him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Barati was reportedly attacked by up to 15 people, including expatriate guards, only two local men were ever charged, convicted and sentenced - to five years' jail. Eight months ago, one of those escaped from prison and hasn't been apprehended since. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a wall in the middle of the centre are posted pictures of men who have died in the detention centre - Barati, murdered; Faysal Ishak Ahmed, who collapsed after being rebuffed from medical help after dozens of fits ; Hamid Kehazaei, who died of sepsis after a small infection in his leg overtook his whole body; Hamed Shamshiripour, who killed himself after more than a year of warnings to Australian authorities he was psychotic and a danger to himself and others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here there are people from every religion, Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists. But most of us now are atheists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Benham Satah    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over tea - there is a little sugar remaining - Satah is mournful for lost friends, but is moved to rage as he says hope for the future is what has been damaged most. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this place there are people from every religion, Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists. But most of us now are atheists. We know there is no fucking God in this place.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the refugees have abandoned any ideal of Australia as a country that might one day welcome them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't care about Australia, I don't care where they send me, I just need to be somewhere safe,&quot; a Kurdish refugee, who declines to give his name, says. &quot;Safety is all I want, and we are not safe here.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far beyond the issue of their alternative accommodation on Manus not being ready (power and water is intermittent in the places refugees are being encouraged to relocate to), safety is the major reason why men are still in this place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are rising tensions in Manus between the local population and the transplanted refugee one. The province's only city, Lorengau, is small, monocultural and close-knit. It is a conservative place and almost everybody is linked by the familial bonds of wantok that criss-cross all over the island. The imposition of several hundred young men from vastly different backgrounds into their town, living on their land, has had the obvious outcome from Manusians. Tensions are especially high over relationships between refugee men and local women. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After dark, many refugees say, they are too scared go out, and almost all have a story about being attacked and robbed. Some show scars from having been assaulted by gangs wielding iron bars and machetes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other men still in the detention centre who have never left it after being sent there more than four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the same time, there are many Manusians who are supportive of the refugees and empathetic to their situations. Many Manusians are trying to assist the refugees stranded inside the detention centre. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezatullah Kakar still has the kickboxer's physique that made him a champion in Pakistan, but he says his mind has been weakened by years of indefinite detention, and the capricious, shape-shifting regime which has held him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I lost my memory in this place. I can't remember my past and I can't think about my future. The future for us is the next day; will we survive?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hassan, who is older, gives his first name and his six-digit boat ID, PRT094, by way of introduction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am like everybody else. Waiting for my life back. Waiting for ... I don't know what.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has two children, now aged 11 and 15, he hasn't seen in four-and-a-half years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss them every day. All those years I have lost.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hassan sleeps on top of a shipping container, surrounded by a makeshift clothesline bearing all the clothes he owns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Turnbull could go to Manus to see what's happening. But that would take courage | Nick McKim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each night he climbs a ladder to reach his makeshift bed. It is cooler outside, he says, and safer up high. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they come,&quot; he says of the police raid he expects, &quot;I can kick the ladder away and I am more safe. But only a little. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Goodnight.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the morning, Satah is calmer. He says he slept little. He takes a dangerous number of sleeping tablets each night, but his tolerance is so high, after years uninterrupted consumption, they barely have any effect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mind is too hard to control. It is hard to think properly, because there is so much pressure on us. Four-and-a-half years is too long. Still, we don't know what will happen to us. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we just wait. And we try to survive.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">863 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by website of Turkish pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak on 23 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Commentary by Ozlem Albayrak: &quot;The Syrians matter should be taken seriously&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking back, it was only early last month that I wrote a review on refugees based on Turkish pop singer Demet Akalin's statement, &quot;Syrians should go back home.&quot; When, shortly after the article, nine-months pregnant Emani Errahman who was raped was then killed with her 11-month-old son, I had written another article dealing with the Syrian refugee problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that I am someone who writes frequently on the topic of Syrians. Despite the frequency, I wanted to write on Syrians again today, yet I think this topic is going to have heavier outcomes than predicted. I had the chance in the last two months to speak to many people and make observations in different places and different environments. Of course these observations are not scientifically binding, but if complaints about Syrian neighbours are the first thing that comes out of the mouth of every two of the three people you speak to, then there is certainly a sociological situation and, I believe that a very serious wave of racism is rising from the lower echelons of society in Turkey; this wave is not diminishing, it is increasingly growing, expanding.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me put it like this: The fact that the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) voter profile in Turkey has no toleration for Syrians was officially declared on two occasions by CHP Chairman Kemal Kilicdaroglu through his statement, &quot;When we come to power, we will send them home.&quot; To concretely see the discrimination in certain Aegean and Mediterranean cities, the CHP's natural hinterland, one does not need to be a local of that region. For instance, when you stay in Mugla or Izmir for a couple days and speak to a few people, the topic immediately coming to Syrians and discourse about exaggerated security concerns is enough to show the state of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, conservatives who appear to be average Justice and Development Party (AK Party) voters are also seen quite frequently to have animosity towards Syrians. They too complain of the lack of peace in their neighbourhoods, saying &quot;they have permeated everywhere.&quot; We already know the neo-nationalists' theory: &quot;Instead of staying in Syria and fighting for their land, they flee and come here and stare at our women on our beaches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's worse is that part of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) also share the same opinion. As the MHP voters generally support policies produced through &quot;race,&quot; it is understandable, likewise the CHP voter adopts a &quot;race&quot; based political approach from a different aspect. If you ask them, forget refugees, even those who do not bear the qualities of &quot;an acceptable citizen,&quot; despite living in this country, do not belong here. We are used to this; what we are not used to is the widespread Syrian refugee racism among conservatives; there is no room for this in our religion, in AK Party policies or humanity, but that is the way it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hatred and discrimination in Turkey against Syrians is silently growing. It seems that our community could not be convinced to believe that even if part of the refugees return, part of them will not return and stay with us, and that we will build Turkey's future together. It appears that in the last five-year period, it has not been possible to prevent Syrian refugees from being seen as burdens. This needs to be solved. How? Of course, not by sending them back to their country, which is in a state of ruins; by first raising awareness among the community, then convincing them and then through integration. The discourse of CHP politicians, performance artists and some who are considered as elites that produces racism and hatred do not help convince the people to live together. Responsible politics are essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second topic is education. More than half of the refugees are under 18 and all of them need to be included in the curriculum in Turkey. Of course there are integration efforts in relation to Syrians, but because they are made separately within every institute and as the refugee problem is not managed from a single centre, it is difficult for us to know about those other than the ones that come up on the media's agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing to list the things that need to be done: Practices such as free health services for Syrians was - in my opinion - the product of quite a humane and right thought, yet for integration, Syrians need to be employed. The matter that requires attention in employment is to prevent the exploitation of labour, otherwise, justified complaints such as, &quot;they are dropping prices in the market by doing the work we do at lower prices,&quot; will emerge on the Turkish side and the exploitation will continue. The exploitation of labour can be prevented by granting them work permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, before anything, a Refugee Ministry needs to be established. And it needs to be done imminently. If such a sharp fault line has emerged in a time period as short as five years, I cannot begin to think about what may happen 10 years later.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.K., Dec. 18 -- The UK Government made the following announcement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brandon Lewis speaks at a Convention of Scottish Local Authorities event to mark 2 years of the vulnerable person's resettlement scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a pleasure to be here with you all today. The past 2 years of resettlement in Scotland have been a wonderful journey and I'm so pleased to be able to share this celebration with you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland, along with the rest of the UK, should be proud of the way it has welcomed some of the world's most vulnerable refugees who have sought protection from conflict or persecution in their own countries. It was a real privilege to be able to meet some of these individuals earlier today and hear their stories.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone in this room has played a part in making that happen, and it's with this in mind that I am pleased to have a chance to talk to you about 3 things today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, I want to thank you for your support for resettlement in Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, I will say a few words about resettlement across the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, I will touch on how I hope you can be part of the conversation as we consider our future plans for asylum and resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resettlement in Scotland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am delighted with Scotland's achievements so far and your continued support for refugee resettlement. I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to Scottish local authorities, COSLA, the Scottish Government and all other partners in Scotland involved in supporting resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These families have been welcomed by communities in every part of Scotland. From Argyll and Bute to right here in Edinburgh, you have been providing refugees with a safe environment and the opportunity to rebuild their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resettlement in Scotland has been dependent on collaboration with partners from the beginning of the Scheme, and I am extremely grateful for the leadership and support that COSLA and the Scottish Government have provided so far. Across the UK, we have seen all parts of the community coming forward to resettle refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK resettlement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incredible support we have seen here for refugees from Syria is present across the UK. Since the scheme began, we have resettled over 9,300 individuals across 263 local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in addition to the thousands we grant protection to under normal asylum procedures and our other resettlement schemes. In the past year, we have also resettled over 400 at-risk children and their families through our Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to you, these families receive a warm welcome as well as support to integrate into their new communities, including learning English and preparing for work and self-sufficiency. I ask you all to please continue your good work, as we are on track to meet our commitment to resettle 23,000 refugees by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Future of asylum and resettlement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As 2020 draws nearer, we must now consider what the future of resettlement should be beyond our existing commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our ability to deliver resettlement depends on your continued support in offering and providing placements for these refugees. I know the challenges this can present, especially given that this is not the only scheme which requires the support and assistance of local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am very grateful for the contribution that Glasgow has made to the asylum dispersal scheme, particularly given the increased pressures in recent years. I am keen for more local authorities in Scotland to participate in the scheme. I would encourage those of you not participating to do so; we stand ready to work with you to plan how you can participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will also have seen the news that the National Transfer Scheme will be extended to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales to allow the relevant authorities in each nation of the UK to participate and ensure it is a truly national scheme. I hope that I can count on your support for the scheme, helping unaccompanied children to get settled in the areas in which they are going to be looked after as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we move forward, I want us to work together as we discuss what our next steps should be. Only by taking a collaborative approach will we be able to provide the best outcomes for resettled families and the local communities they are placed in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to finish by thanking you once again for all that you have done, and congratulating you on this milestone. I look forward to continuing to work with you to welcome and provide sanctuary to more vulnerable families.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2,000 refugees and migrants who had been sleeping rough on the streets in Paris for weeks in squalid and insanitary conditions have been evicted and bussed to temporary shelters in school gymnasiums as riot police stood by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of refugees and migrants arrived in the Porte de La Chapelle area of northern Paris, sleeping under road bridges and on the side of the road with almost no access to water, sanitation and food, outside Paris's new aid centre for asylum-seekers that was opened in November.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eviction began at dawn on Friday and took place calmly as riot police watched over groups of men and women from countries including Afghanistan and Eritrea - some only with small rucksacks or plastic bags of belongings - being moved and placed on buses and driven out of of Paris. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the 34th police evacuation of large numbers of refugees and migrants sleeping rough in the French capital since 2015. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers warned that France needed to establish an efficient long-term strategy for processing and housing asylum-seekers in decent conditions rather than constantly taking emergency action at the last minute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those sleeping rough had queued each day for access to the aid centre only to find it was full. Hundreds had bedded down on the pavement outside the gates, alongside traffic-choked roads. In recent weeks, more than 1,000 people had been sleeping here, with aid associations saying 200 more arrived each week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers of refugees and migrants sleeping rough in Paris has grown after the closure last October of the Calais migrant camp - a vast makeshift shanty town near the Channel coast where thousands had lived in squalid conditions, hoping to get into Britain by stowing away on board motor vehicles entering the Channel tunnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, French authorities organised buses to take people to temporary locations in the Paris region, mainly school gymnasiums that had become available during the holiday season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 25-year-old former veterinary student who described fleeing violence in Somalia, had been sleeping on the street here for one week, with little water or food and no blankets to lie on. He had come down to Paris from Calais after several weeks in squalid conditions there. &quot;I'm exhausted from living on the street,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;I'm not sure where they are taking us today. I just want to be somewhere fit for humans. I'm so tired and hungry, but you just have to be patient.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 22-year-old Afghan man said: &quot;It has been two months sleeping under a motorway bridge with little water, not much food, some fights between different groups here. You never really sleep. I would queue every day but there was no hope getting into the aid centre here.&quot; He said he hoped for somewhere to sleep indoors and the possibility to begin an asylum application in France. &quot;We're humans, we're not animals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guillaume Schers, who runs the emergency programme for Terre d'Asile, a French NGO working with asylum-seekers, said: &quot;The number of people arriving in France is not likely to drop this summer.&quot; He said there had to be a permanent, stable and strategic plan for taking care of asylum-seekers in France rather than the current &quot;multi-layered and complex&quot; system focused on crisis-management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corinne Torre, the head of French operations for the doctors' charity, M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, said poor hygiene and sanitary conditions for the people who had been sleeping rough in Paris had worsened existing skin infections. But she said cases of scabies had been contained to 7% to 8% of the refugees and migrants, adding that it was not an epidemic, contrary to a rumour spreading among local residents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Torre warned that the major issue was refugees' and migrants' mental health after trauma. &quot;Most of these people have come through Libya. Many have faced violence, torture, inhumane treatment, traffickers or sexual violence. We don't talk enough about that, and there should be better structures in place to deal with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some local politicians in Paris have warned against a continuing cycle of evacuations, and the return of rough-sleepers, with a lack of long-term strategy on asylum. The last police evacuation in Porte de La Chapelle was only two months ago, in which 1,610 migrants were moved. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evacuation in Paris comes as 600 to 700 refugees and migrants sleep rough in Calais in precarious conditions, since the sprawling migrant camp was dismantled last autumn. The French human rights ombudsman recently warned of dire conditions for migrants in Calais. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities and NGOs trying to distribute food and water in Calais complained that the police and local authorities were preventing them from providing basic aid to refugees and migrants, and took court action last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A court ruled against the creation of a new aid centre in Calais but stipulated that the refugees and migrants must be given access to water, showers and toilets, which the local authorities have refused to provide. The judge said: &quot;It is not possible to leave these people, who are in a state of complete destitution, without any aid.&quot; The state has appealed against the court ruling that stipulated it must provide basic water and sanitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new centrist French president, Emmanuel Macron, told both houses of parliament gathered in Versailles this week that he wanted to overhaul the French asylum system, which has been criticised as too slow, inefficient and lacking in protections. Macron said he wanted &quot;a more human, and fairer&quot; treatment of asylum-requests by refugees. An announcement is expected in the coming weeks on what shape a reform of the French asylum system would take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Calais, Maya Konforti, a volunteer with the Auberge des Migrants, which works with refugees and migrants, warned of harsh police treatment of those in Calais. She said: &quot;Macron says he wants to put more humanity into the system and speed up the asylum process, that is good. But the Ministry of the Interior is still doing the dirty work.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newcastle University has joined a city-wide coalition to welcome refugees and asylum seekers to the city.<BR><BR>Shared values<BR><BR>Professor Chris Day, Vice-Chancellor and President of the University, this week signed a pledge to support Newcastle: City of Sanctuary. The organisation works closely with communities, voluntary and faith organisations to help new arrivals to the city settle in and highlights the contribution of refugees to the area they have made their home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Day signed the pledge with Sarah Smart, co-ordinator of Newcastle: City of Sanctuary.<BR><BR>'I'm proud to sign this document, which pledges our support to an organisation which is working so hard to help people who are making a new home in this city,' he said. 'We share many of the values of Newcastle: City of Sanctuary and this is another example of Newcastle University's ongoing commitment to social justice.<BR><BR>'It is extremely fitting that the University has pledged its support as we come towards the end of Freedom City 2017, our year-long commemoration of Dr Martin Luther King's visit to Newcastle to receive an honorary degree in November 1967. The great problems he identified, war, poverty and racism, are things refugees and asylum seekers often face.'<BR><BR>Commitment to social justice<BR><BR>Sarah Smart said: 'Newcastle: City of Sanctuary's vision is that wherever those seeking sanctuary go within the city they will find people that understand why they are here, welcome them and include them fully as members, colleagues, volunteers and friends.<BR><BR>'By signing this pledge of support Newcastle University is showing their commitment to supporting this vision, sending out a positive message of inclusion to asylum seekers and refugees within Newcastle.'<BR><BR>One of the core values of Newcastle University is a commitment to social justice and its Institute for Social Renewal looks at how people and communities thrive in turbulent times. Many academics across the University are investigating issues such as migration, displacement and belonging.<BR><BR>Professor Mark Shucksmith, Director of the Newcastle University Institute for Social Renewal said: 'Recently, social and political turmoil and rising inequality have led many refugees to flee violence and look for a more stable place to live and work. Globally, one in every 122 humans is now either a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum. Unfortunately such displacement is likely to be a continuing feature of the 21st Century, and as researchers and as citizens we will seek to play our part in mitigating the impacts on those seeking sanctuary, welcoming them to our city and protecting their human rights.'<BR><BR>Supporting refuges and asylum seekers<BR><BR>The University has a number of schemes in place to support refugees and asylum seekers including reduced fees for eligible students. It also directs these students to other organisations which can help and support them. It contributes to the Council for At-Risk Academics (CARA) which helps academics and scientists fleeing from discrimination, persecution, suffering and violence in some of the world's most dangerous places. It also works with a number of charitable foundations to alleviate the suffering of those in such difficult circumstances.<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POPE Francis has asked for forgiveness from refugees in Bangladesh for the hurt and persecution they have endured, and spoke the word he had avoided days earlier in Burma: &quot;Rohingya&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a deeply moving encounter in Dhaka, Francis greeted and blessed a group of Rohingya Muslim refugees, grasping their hands and listening to their stories in a show of public solidarity amid Asia's worst refugee crisis in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He apologised for the &quot;indifference of the world&quot; to their plight and then pronounced the name of their ethnic group to a gathering of Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and Christian leaders. &quot;The presence of God today is also called 'Rohingya'&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 16 Rohingya - 12 men, two women and two young girls - had traveled to Dhaka from Cox's Bazar, the district bordering Burma where refugee camps are overflowing with more than 620,000 Rohingya who have fled what the UN says is a campaign of ethnic cleansing by Burma's military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign has included the burning of villages and fleeing Rohingya have described rape and shootings by Burmese soldiers and Buddhist mobs that left them no option but to make the dangerous and sometimes deadly journey through jungles and by sea to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burma government has denied any such campaign is under way. The army says &quot;clearance operations&quot; are targeting militants who attacked security positions in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma's government and most of the Buddhist majority opoose the term &quot;Rohingya&quot;, saying the members of the Muslim minority are &quot;Bengalis&quot; who migrated illegally from Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma does not acknowledge them as a local ethnic group and will not give them citizenship, even though they have lived in Burma for generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one, each of the refugees approached the Pope at the end of the event in the tented garden of the Dhaka archbishop's residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis blessed one little girl, placing his hand on her head, and grasped the shoulder of a young man. The women who approached him pushed aside their headscarves so they could speak, offering their hands out for him to hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe we can't do much for you, but your tragedy has a place in our hearts,&quot; hetold them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His voice trembling with emotion, he continued: &quot;In the name of all those who persecute you, who have persecuted you, and those who have hurt you, above all in the indifference of the world, I ask you for forgiveness. Forgiveness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing the &quot;big heart&quot; of Bangladesh that welcomed them, Francis said: &quot;Now I appeal to your big hearts, that you are able to grant us the forgiveness that we seek.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for continued aid for the refugees, and continued advocacy &quot;so that their rights are recognised&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We won't close our hearts. We won't look away,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis had refrained from publicly raising the crisis or using the word Rohingya in Burma out of diplomatic deference to his hosts. The Holy See only established diplomatic relations with Burma in May, and the local Catholic Church had begged Francis not to create waves - and possible problems for them - by using the term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis' encounter with the refugees was the highlight of his day that began with a Mass to ordain 16 new priests. Bangladesh's tiny Catholic community represents a fraction of 1% of the majority Muslim population of 160 million. Despite its small size, the Catholic Church runs a network of schools, orphanages and clinics and has enjoyed relative freedom in its work, although Christian missionaries say they have received threats.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A surge in refugee arrivals has led to soaring tensions on Greece's outlying Aegean islands, with Lesbos's mayor accusing the government in Athens of allowing it to become a giant prison camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boycotting celebrations on Wednesday marking the 105th anniversary of Lesbos's liberation from Ottoman Turkish rule, local officials gave the leftist-led coalition in Athens an ultimatum: either it took immediate action to decongest the island or risked mass protests from an increasingly unruly population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are utterly opposed to policies that are turning Lesbos and other border areas into concentration camps where all human dignity is denied,&quot; said Spyros Galinos, the island's mayor. &quot;The government has failed to keep to its commitment to effectively deal with this problem and move people on.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosive mood matches the rising number of asylum seekers on Lesbos, the gateway for the vast majority of refugees and migrants who entered Europe at the height of the crisis in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Thousands of unaccompanied children in Greek island camps need help | Alfonso Montero</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close to 6,000 people are being held at the island's main camp in Moria, which was initially established as a temporary measure to house no more than 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a fourfold daily increase in arrivals nationwide over the past three months, the Greek immigration minister Ioannis Mouzalas said the government was considering renting hotels and dispatching cruise ships to the islands to house the growing numbers over the winter months. &quot;The rise is concerning,&quot; he told a recent news conference in Athens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a landmark deal agreed between the EU and Turkey to stem the influx in March 2016, refugees reaching Greek islands are forbidden from travelling to the mainland pending completion of asylum requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result nearly 15,000 men, women and children are stranded on Lesbos, Chios, Kos, Samos and Leros, the Aegean islands closest to Turkey's shores, according to figures released by Greece's interior ministry. In Lesbos and Samos more than 8,300 asylum seekers and migrants are living in facilities meant for just 3,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that refugee and migrant numbers jumped from 3,665 in August to 4,604 in September. &quot;After the fall of Mosul there has been a discernible increase ... and 98% of those who come request asylum,&quot; said Daniel Esdras, the IOM's Greece office director. &quot;Any change in a conflict zone will automatically have a huge impact on migratory flows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The containment policy has been denounced by human rights groups. In a letter last month to the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, 18 organisations said the abysmal conditions in which people were being made to live - including the elderly, infirm and vulnerable - were placing lives at risk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Forcing asylum seekers to remain in conditions that violate their rights and are harmful to their wellbeing, health and dignity cannot be justified by the implementation of the deal,&quot; the human rights groups wrote. &quot;With the approach of the third winter since large-scale arrivals on the islands began, it is evident that Greek authorities cannot meet the basic needs and protect the right of asylum seekers while they remain [there].&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal authorities have reacted furiously to suggestions that camps be enlarged and new ones established, arguing that expansion in any form will only lure more refugees and migrants. Lesbos's council has said it is &quot;categorically opposed to the creation of any new facility, including the planned use of floating centres&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the height of the refugee crisis before countries along the Balkan corridor closed their frontiers and shut off entry to Europe, locals on Lesbos exhibited extraordinary compassion, rushing to greet refugees and offering aid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the failure to effectively decongest the islands since the EU-Turkey deal was signed has prompted growing anger with residents blaming overcrowding for almost every ill, including the rise in crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alleviation was necessary not only to maintain the dignity of people fleeing poverty and war but to &quot;protect social cohesion in a border area that is of national significance to Greece&quot;, its town hall said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Athens have been reluctant to criticise Ankara for the increase in numbers, instead attributing the rise to a reflection of Turkey's strained relations with the EU before a visit to Greece in early December by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are Turkey's neighbour, we are not Luxembourg and so we are careful about what we say,&quot; said Ioannis Balafas, the deputy migration minister. &quot;What we are seeing is a political game. Whenever Turkey wants to put the pressure on Europe it turns on the tap and lets more [people] through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giorgos Koumoutsakos, the shadow minister of foreign affairs in the main opposition New Democracy party, agreed. &quot;If it really wanted to, Turkey could more effectively control the flows,&quot; he said. &quot;What we are seeing, it would seem, is a reflection of Turkey's problematic relationship with the EU.&quot; In the meantime, Greece's easternmost islands were paying the price. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a race to prevent a cholera outbreak among the more than half a million Rohingya refugee arrivals over the past six weeks in Cox's Bazaar, Bangladesh, United Nations agencies launched on Tuesday a massive immunization campaign.<BR><BR>&quot;Emergency vaccination saves lives. The risk of cholera is clear and present, and the need for decisive action apparent,&quot; says Dr. N Paranietharan, World Health Organization Representative to Bangladesh said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign, which is led by the Ministry of Health and supported by the WHO and The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), is being held in Ukhiya and Teknaf, where more than half a million people have arrived from across the border since August, joining vast numbers already residing in a series of settlements and camps.<BR><BR>Some 900,000 doses of the vaccine have been mobilized and are being delivered by more than 200 mobile vaccination teams, making it the second largest oral cholera vaccination campaign ever, according to the UN.<BR><BR>&quot;WHO is committed to mobilizing its full technical and operational capacity to support the Ministry and our partners to protect, promote and secure the health of this immensely vulnerable population,&quot; he added.<BR><BR>After more than 10,292 cases of diarrhoea had been reported and treated from across the settlements and camps over the last week, WHO warned of the potential for a cholera outbreak.<BR><BR>&quot;Cholera is a dangerous disease, especially among children living in cramped, unhygienic conditions. Prevention is essential,&quot; said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF Representative in Bangladesh.<BR><BR>The International Organization for Migration's (IOM) Senior Regional Medical Officer for Asia and the Pacific, Patrick Duigan, welcomed the critically important initiative, but stressed, &quot;there are still multiple and serious public health risks for this refugee population and a massive scale up of resources and the overall response is needed to mitigate further risks of life threatening illnesses.&quot;<BR><BR>To help meet water, sanitation and hygiene needs, UNICEF is scaling up its interventions and communication on safe practices, and prepositioning critical supplies for case management and supporting the Ministry of Health to set up diarrhoea treatment centres, among other response-oriented interventions. Meeting the arrival surge In parallel, against the backdrop of Bangladesh border guards saying that more than 11,000 Rohingya refugees crossed by land on Monday alone into south-eastern Bangladesh through several points, the Office of the High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) spokesperson Adrian Edwards told reporters at today's regular press briefing in Geneva that &quot;UNHCR is working with the Bangladesh authorities on a transit centre for a potential refugee influx over the coming days.&quot;<BR><BR>UNHCR sources say that many of the new refugees came from the Buthidaung area in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state. Some said they fled torching and killings back home; one boy was seen with a big gash across his neck. Others said they left in fear ahead of anticipated violence.<BR><BR>To reach Bangladesh, they walked for up to 14 days. Many were carrying children and baskets containing whatever they could pack at short notice. They waded through marshland before swimming across the Naf river that divides the two countries. Many women and children could not swim and had to ride piggyback on volunteer swimmers. Some used inflated plastic bags and UNHCR tarpaulins as makeshift flotation devices.<BR><BR>&quot;The new arrivals have now been moved away from the border areas into established camps and settlements in the Kutupalong and Balukhali area. UNHCR has trucked in plastic sheets and jerry cans for water. We are also coordinating with the government and partners to provide urgent services - food, water and healthcare - to these new refugees,&quot; flagged Mr. Edwards.<BR><BR>In preparation for the possible new arrivals, UNHCR's Government counterpart, the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission (RRRC), will lead preparedness activities with UNHCR in coordination with partners, including UNICEF, IOM, WHO and the World Food Programme (WFP).<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ozone hole over Antarctica shrank to its smallest peak since 1988, Nasa said yesterday. The huge hole in Earth's protective ozone layer reached its maximum this year in September, and this year Nasa said it was 7.6 million square miles wide. The hole size shrinks after mid-September. This year's maximum hole is more than twice as big as the United States, but it's 1.3 million square miles less than last year and 3.3 million square miles smaller than 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Newman, chief Earth scientist at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, said stormy conditions in the upper atmosphere warmed the air and kept the chemicals chlorine and bromine from eating ozone. He said scientists haven't quite figured out why some years are stormier - and have smaller ozone holes - than others. &quot;It's really small this year. That's a good thing,&quot; Newman said. He added that this year's drop is mostly natural but is on top of a trend of smaller steady improvements likely from the banning of ozone-eating chemicals in a 1987 international treaty. The ozone hole hit its highest in 2000 at 11.5 million square miles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top chains profit on back of Syrian refugees, claims watchdog</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Europe's biggest stores are failing to stem the abuse of Syrian refugees who work in the Turkish factories that supply their clothes, a business pressure group said today. The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC) called on the worst offenders -from fashion icon Topshop to discounter Aldi - to better protect refugee workers who have fled war only to suffer workplace exploitation in their new home. Low wages, discrimination and poor conditions are common for Syrian refugees working in Turkey's multi-billion dollar garment industry, where child labour is also a problem, said the BHRRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some high street fashion brands... have made progress in protecting workers, but too many like Aldi, Asda and Topshop are lagging way behind,&quot; said Phil Bloomer, executive director of the BHRRC. The British-based pressure group surveyed 37 major European brands with Turkish factories in their supply chains on the policies and practices undertaken to tackle the abuse of workers. Companies including supermarket chains Aldi and Asda and fashion retailer Arcadia - which owns the Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge brands - are not doing enough to stop the exploitation, the BHRRC survey found. ASOS, New Look, Next, SuperDry and Zara were the top-ranking brands in the survey; Asda and Arcadia came bottom. The charity said more brands had boosted efforts to clean up their supply chains compared to last year, with the top performers establishing plans to protect refugees, providing mechanisms to handle complaints, and initiating dialogue with workers' groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than three million Syrian refugees - about half aged under 18 - have fled to Turkey to escape a war that erupted in 2011. About 650,000 are estimated to be working in Turkey, many in the garment industry, yet most lack work permits, leaving them at greater risk of abuse, the BHRRC said. A spokesman for Walmart, which owns Asda, said the company was exploring how to address the risks to vulnerable workers in its global supply chain, with a focus on ethical recruitment. Topshop declined to comment on the BHRRC survey, Aldi did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and Mexx and River Island could not be reached. Thomson Reuters Foundation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans unveil tax plans to benefit America's middle class</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax plan, revealed yesterday, promises savings next year of $1,182 for a typical household of four with a gross income of $59,000, leaving their tax bill at $400. What is clear is that many of the benefits for the middle class could dwindle over time, even while companies and wealthy individuals could enjoy lasting tax advantages. &quot;We are focused on increasing paychecks in a major way,&quot; said Republican Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But the proposal's conflicting provisions and phase-outs of certain benefits suggest that taxes could rise for some middle-class earners over time. And for many, the income gains being touted by President Donald Trump are unlikely to materialise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of these complications arise because under the budget instructions, the planned tax cuts can't increase the national debt by more than $1.5 trillion over the next decade. Anything above $1.5 trillion would force the Republicans to amend their plan to generate more revenue - a change that would likely prove difficult. Trump has frequently said that this would be the biggest tax cut in US history. But outside analysis shows that's not the case. The tax plan's primary beneficiaries would be wealthier Americans, who would enjoy lower tax rates despite the elimination of some breaks. &quot;With the details they've presented to us so far, it looks like the tax cut benefits the wealthy and major corporations,&quot; said Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts and a former staff economist at the Treasury Department. &quot;In fact, if you have a large family, given the facts that we have now, you would pay more in taxes.&quot; AP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Venezuela seeks to restructure foreign debt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nicolas Maduro announced yesterday that he will begin restructuring Venezuela's foreign debt, calling it the best way to get around US financial sanctions he said are crippling the oil-dependent nation. But in a sign he may be trying to avoid an ugly fight with Wall Street, Mr Maduro also ordered state-run oil company PDVSA to make one last $1.2bn bond payment in full before attempting to postpone future foreign payments. &quot;I decree a refinancing and a restructuring of all external debt and all of Venezuela's payments,&quot; he said in a national broadcast address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Venezuela's economy has shrunk more than 35 per cent since 2014 - more than the US did during the Great Depression - President Maduro's socialist government has found itself forced to choose between paying its foreign creditors and helping a population ravaged by triple-digit inflation and widespread food and medicine shortages. For the most past, it's gone out of the way to prioritise paying its debt, finding new funds from ally Russia and proving critics wrong, who for months had been predicting a doomsday default. But financial sanctions announced in August by the Trump administration banning US investors from lending new funds to Venezuela has made it harder to maintain the delicate balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had to face a real global financial persecution,&quot; Mr Maduro said, adding that Venezuela had paid $72bn in debt since he came to power in 2013, despite a precipitous fall in oil income for the Opec nation. AP</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHITE Western European audiences are challenged about their response to the global refugee crisis in the latest play by Dublin theatre company Brokentalkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Beach, which will be shown in Belfast this weekend, is a blistering satire to the on-going refugee crisis in Europe, examining the notion of sovereignty of one people over a piece of land; and the lengths people will go to bar entry to their dominion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The setting is a private beach, owned and inhabited by a European family for generations. The family are celebrating a wedding when a stranger arrives on the shore - the drama unfolds as the family decide how to deal with them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brokentalkers are acclaimed internationally for their pioneering work of telling stories of social importance in an innovative way. Co-written and directed by founders Feidlim Cannon and Gary Keegan, the play began when the duo were approached in 2014 by the German Europoly festival to be part of a group of pan-European artists making work about Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a visit by the pair to a refugee camp outside Berlin to begin research for the play radically altered their conception of what they would go on to write.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had initially intended to create a piece based on the experiences of refugees, similar to the approach we had taken in our other productions, such as Blue Boy, where we interview people, take their stories and devise a piece around what we heard,&quot; explains Gary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But when we arrived into the camp we discovered they already had their own successful theatre group making their own work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feidlim and Gary were amongst a long line of similar artists sniffing around for stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The refugees were quite upfront with us in the fact they weren't really interested in the likes of us white European, somewhat privileged artists, coming in and cherry-picking their horrendous experiences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair also quickly realised that the refugees were keen to put their past behind them: rather than re-living the trauma they left in their homelands, they were more interested in making theatre about their daily struggles, such as conditions in the camp, work permits and having their status held in limbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary says their visit was a &quot;wake-up call&quot; and outlines how the play changed following their visit to the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm relieved we saw and heard what we did. It was a message to take a different approach. Rather than being at risk of exploiting others, we turned the gaze back on ourselves and explore European attitudes towards dark people and people from outside the European family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He describes the archetypal characters in the play as &quot;disagreeable&quot; and &quot;grotesque&quot;. Each character represent the different facets and viewpoints of our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One character is obsessed with security and walls and borders, another is more volatile and extreme about keeping 'foreigners' out. The mother-in-law character is a type of liberal person, who seems to want to help, but doesn't listen to the stranger's needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oldest character wants to keep them on the beach for free labour, whilst the bride is an artist who wants to exploit the stranger for artistic gratification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is kind of based on us, when we visited the refugee camp,&quot; admits Gary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Beach also highlights the fact that migration is a natural phenomenon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we have seen recently with the hurricanes in America and the Caribbean migration happens due to environmental conditions. Even if you look back at early civilisation - we all came from somewhere,&quot; adds Gary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it addresses a very serious issue, This Beach is humorous, lively, colourful and sharp in its treatment of the subject and provides plenty of laughs as well as being though-provoking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Often we were making work about other people whose stories we were telling and there was an onus on us to be respectful and stay within parameters. This time it is a dramatic fiction, so we have a freedom we don't usually have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next up for The Brokentalkers is a documentary play based on the life story of singer Mary Coughlan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Beach opens at Belfast's Lyric Theatre on November 25. See Lyrictheatre.co.uk for ticket details.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Max Liu</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOOKS; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">894 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After years on the peripheries of US fiction and poetry, Asian American authors have stepped into the spotlight during 2017. Books by writers of east and south-east Asian heritage are one of the hottest trends this year. Led by Viet Thanh Nguyen, Jenny Zhang and the poet Ocean Vuong, it marks the emergence into the centre of the US literary world of a previously marginalised group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transcultural writers, born to immigrant parents in the US or immigrants themselves as children, they are channelling their experiences into writing that, with perfect historical timing, challenges readers to resist attacks on immigrants' rights and to see refugees as individuals with unique stories. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experiences of displaced people are central to the work of this new generation of Asian Americans, and their books cross genres and forms. Vuong, who recently won the Forward prize for best first collection, arrived in the US as a refugee from Vietnam in 1990. His poems in Night Sky With Exit Wounds mix migration with myth and eroticism. Early in the collection, the narrator of Telemachus pulls his father from the sea, dragging him &quot;through white sand, his knuckles carving a trail / the waves rush in to erase&quot;. Such images stick in the reader's mind and, though it is never said explicitly, feel as if they are etched in the memory of the young gay Asian man navigating the 21st-century US in subsequent poems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories in Nguyen's The Refugees are set in Vietnam and among refugee communities in California. The author disarms the reader, consistently complicating our sympathies. What came before and after the characters' journeys across the Pacific pervade the collection. His book is dedicated to &quot;all refugees, everywhere&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  War baby: the amazing story of Ocean Vuong, former refugee and prize-winning poet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The privileged twentysomethings in Tony Tulathimutte's satirical novel, Private Citizens, inhabit a different California - San Francisco's tech scene in the 2000s - but like Nguyen's characters, they're alive to the nuances of Asian American experience. Tulathimutte's Thai American protagonist Will is accused of being paranoid about racism, but he is clearly on to something as he witnesses the lives of Asians overlooked because, he says, &quot;they're outside the black-white binary&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a thrilling and almost wild energy about Jenny Zhang's long sentences in the connected stories of Sour Heart. The brutality of communist China is vividly remembered and the hardships of immigrant life graphically enumerated by young narrators, among them a girl who says: &quot;Going to school in Little Neck was the only thing - short of spending eighty grand on a down payment for a new house, short of having hundreds of thousands of dollars for private tuition - that stood any chance of saving me from a life of misery, poverty and pain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence features in all these books, not least in South Korean-born Patty Yumi Cottrell's autobiographical novel, Sorry to Disrupt the Peace, in which an alienated young woman tries to discover why her adoptive brother committed suicide. One of the year's most distinctive memoirs, meanwhile, is Yiyun Li's piercing Dear Friend, From My Life I Write to You in Your Life in which Li, who moved to the US in her 20s, calls her decision to write in English instead of Chinese &quot;a suicide&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the current wave of young authors is one of 2017's most significant stories, there are of course some older Asian American authors who paved the way. Notable are Maxine Hong Kingston, whose The Woman Warrior (1976) articulates her experiences as a first generation Chinese-American woman, and the late Hisaye Yamamoto, whose Seventeen Syllables and Other Stories (1988) concerns Japanese immigrants and their American descendants, including the important story of those sent to internment camps in California during the second world war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, the South Korean-American Hanya Yanagihara and the Chinese-Canadian Madeleine Thien were shortlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2015 and 2016 respectively, while the Taiwanese American Tao Lin has ploughed a distinctive furrow with his experimental metafiction. But these authors seemed like lonely trailblazers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One theme in the work of the new writers, which reflects current concerns is micro-aggression, especially when it comes to names. &quot;It's pronounced TOO-lah-tim-OO-tee,&quot; begins the biographical note on Tulathimutte's website. I empathise. Since I can remember, my Chinese surname has been causing confusion, misspelling and mispronunciation, even though it's really very simple: it contains three letters and comes from my granddad who immigrated to Liverpool after the second world war. I've always been fairly incurious about my Chinese heritage, but reading Asian American writers this year, I've thought more about my Anglo-Chinese identity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will we soon see a wave of literature by writers of east and south-east Asian heritage in the UK? It is already rising, with the poetry of Hong Kong-born Sarah Howe, the fiction of Japanese-Chinese-British-American Rowan Hisayo Buchanan and London-based Chinese writer Xiaolu Guo. And of course, it would be odd not to mention Japanese-born English Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro, whose body of work tells us subtle and enduring truths about who we are, as only writers who can reveal a culture from outside can. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1066 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To think the Department of Justice never even asked them what they thought of the idea and didn t even tell them why the hotel was being finished out, so that they dared to hope there d soon be a  situations vacant  sign in the window; only to have their hopes dashed with the announcement last January that the deeply depressed town had been earmarked to house the refugees mostly from Syria who we had promised to take a full 18 months before.  Emergency response  my eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what did the community do? They organised to welcome them: They built a  Welcome Wall  with artist Maria Fleming; they built an outdoor and an indoor play area in the empty hotel; they organised football matches; and they put a young Syrian violin maker called Al in touch with retiring violin maker Dave Teehan who donated him his valuable tools.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheer decency of rural Ireland has shone through. Which makes the contrast with the official response of the Department of Justice all the more stark. Most Irish people welcome Syrian refugees. Sixty percent of them told a Newstalk poll they d be happy to live in  close proximity  to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the department whisks them straight from the airport to Baleskin outside Dublin and on to a hotel outside Ballaghaderreen where they look out the window and say:  There are no people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I spent Monday in the Abbeyfield Hotel, Ballaghaderreen. Having made friends with a Syrian refugee volunteer last year in a Greek refugee camp I had promised to visit any of his friends who ended up in Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had seen them on Facebook, beaming and waving Tricolours because they had  got Ireland  and I felt a creeping anxiety they would be disappointed. Sitting with them in the foyer of the Abbeyfield looking out at the rain which bucketed down for the whole day I d have to admit that s what s happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They ve never before seen a town in which  there are no people . They have little contact with locals and in the six months they ve been sitting there speaking Arabic their English hasn t much improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rooms at the back of the hotel have at last been fitted out as classrooms where English classes take place; although no books have been provided, for reasons unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the worst thing about this so-called Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre is it keeps the refugees largely isolated from Irish people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every day,  says one of them. I ask myself the question why this hotel was built here?  I try toexplain the word  boom . Then the word  bust . Ballaghaderreen paid a heavy price and now these Syrians are paying another one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, they re warm and dry and fed. The hotel feels welcoming. The signs are in English and Arabic. The hotel rooms are described as apartments. But these people were in the waiting room of life for a year or more before they arrived here and were told they d be in Ballaghaderreen for four to six weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They didn t expect another nine months or more of limbo and they re bored silly. One woman told me her friends were getting pregnant to break the monotony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They re literally sick and tired of being served up their food. One young man says he s put on a load of weight and another flaps his arms and squawks because he s had chicken so often he thinks he s turning into one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They show me the room they laughingly call  Supervalu , a shop operated from a wardrobe in one of the rooms, which sells Arabic basics like coffee and sunflower seeds. It s just an effort to stay sane made by people who have already lost so much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I met a woman who had to travel to Ballaghaderreen alone because her husband, who was disabled, drowned off the coast of Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I met a man who says he will mnever return to Syria because his 13-year-old brother was taken out of school and murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are everyday stories at the Abbeyfield. And yet these people try so hard to stay cheerful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I spend time with Syrian refugees because it s fun. I love their strength, humanity, faith and warmth but what keeps me coming back is the craic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I realise you can t generalise but in my experiencem Syrians are laughers, jokers, singers, play-acters, inveterate tea-drinkers and always up for a party. They re like us at our best. They are a natural fit with Irish people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we need to get together. And the Department of Justice seems intent on keeping us apart. Yes,  500,000 was doled out in  integration projects . But the refugees don t need projects as much as to be living among Irish people which would, I believe, lead quickly to natural bonds of friendship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those friendships could help these New Irish so much. After just a couple of hours I was offering to mentor a young would-be journalist woman and to help a young man trawl through the paperwork on family reunification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiny offers of help are so gratefully received that it s humbling. But the only reason the offers of help are not coming is that the Abbeyfield residents have had little chance to make Irish friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our government has chosen to waste the Irish people s spirit of hospitality by failing to clear any paths between us and our new guests. By contrast, Canadians can volunteer to help through a government website and Canadian businesses can offer to get involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why has this not happened here? Why has our welcome been squandered? When Dublin s Silk Road Caf&eacute; at the Chester Beatty Library put up a GoFundMe request to bring refugees on coach trips to Dublin, with the help of City of Sanctuary and the Red Cross, the money was in overnight. Irish people want to help but they are not being helped to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another group of 80 refugees is poised to arrive which means my friends will be out of Ballaghaderreen by Christmas. They mostly want to go to cities but will likely be sent to rural Mayo or Donegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let s hope it works out. Already one of my Syrian friends cheers wildly for Mayo in the football, like most of Ballaghaderreen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It s possible they ll all settle very well. But my fear is that the determination of the Department of Justice to keep refugees apart from the rest of the population   and their refusal to facilitate us to give these poor people a true Irish welcome   will one day prove a recipe for disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How long will it take before the refugees stop giving us the benefit of the doubt and begin to distrust us? How long will it take before we begin to distrust them back?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrians are always up for a party. They re like us at our best. They are a natural fit with Irish people</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interpreters for Syrian refugees should be given psychological support as a &quot;priority&quot; due to the stress the work causes, according to a study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers found that while arrangements under the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme (SVPRP) had exceeded the expectations of refugees, there were concerns about support given to interpreters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, which looked at how the scheme was rolled out in Edinburgh as a way to provide guidance for other authorities, highlights how the workers were often the &quot;only available staff&quot; to families, which saw them build close relationships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interpreters reported breaking into tears during meetings and suffering bouts of depression as a result of what they were dealing with, often providing help out of hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SVPRP is a programme which commits the UK Government to resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees. It was announced by the Government following a public outcry over the fate of those attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 8,000 refugees have so far arrived in the UK under the scheme, which has had a &quot;truly transformative&quot; impact on people's lives, according to a recent report from United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have said they are grateful for the &quot;genuine welcome&quot; they have received in the UK, and are heartened that their children have been able to attend school and catch up on lost education, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latest study, published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health, indicates that not enough support id put in place for the interpreters required to support the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the interpreters said in the study: &quot;I just feel down and depressed because every day you are hearing what they've been through and it brings back memories to me, because we've been through this as well in my country - I was crying with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another added: &quot;I've done quite a lot of work with the police, hospitals and courts, but the fact that you establish a relationship with the families, things affect you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NHS Lothian consultant Dermot Gorman, co-author of study, said: &quot;It's always variable with each worker, each one has a different approach, but some would be going out on a Saturday evening to put in papers for appointments. It could be stressful for interpreters. They were hearing stories that perhaps had resonance with their own lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Gorman said the programme has been largely successful and was confident the country could take in more of those in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems identified include language problems for the new arrivals and difficulties with navigating NHS services, which led to them using interpreters as a first point-of-call for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study focused on Edinburgh as it was one of the first in Scotland to take in large numbers through the resettlement scheme. It was announced last week that Scotland had taken in its target of 2,000 refugees three years ahead of schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Th researchers reviewed the successes and downfalls of the programme through the experience and opinions of interpreters during 2015 and 2016, and have called on a number of recommendations to be implemented. In its conclusion it said psychological support for them should be &quot;prioritised&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counselling is available for staff, but the paper said its availability should be reinforced in training for interpreters. It adds that management should consider the workers' own histories when giving them jobs. The findings, have been fed back to City of Edinburgh Council and NHS Lothian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Alison McCallum, NHS Lothian's director of public health and public policy, said: &quot;We are committed to ensuring all our staff, especially those who experience stressful situations through their work, have access to a range of occupational health support services to help them deal with stress and trauma. These services are made available to all our staff, including our interpreters, so that they are able to seek help when they need it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A City of Edinburgh Council spokeswoman said: &quot;We encourage all staff who encounter stress in their role to come forward and access the various support networks we have in place. We are aware of the report and will be considering whether it has any further implications for the support we give our interpreters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ditching the idea of a usual first date, they have jetted to Greece in a bid to help those in need at a refugee camp.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And continuing to document her charitable trip with her Love Island beau, Camilla Thurlow shared a touching post with her 1.3million Instagram followers on Saturday, after being moved by the people she has met during her time there.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality star, who has been accompanied by Jamie Jewitt overseas, explained she was feeling 'overwhelmed with sadness' after her latest experience that saw her attend an English lesson being held for young women aged 14-17 years old.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camilla, who is a keen contributor to charity and had spoken of her hopes to visit a refugee camp with Jamie during her time in Love Island, urged fans to 'do something' to help others in a lengthy message on the photo-sharing site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She penned: 'On our final day we visited Serres, where survivors from the displaced Yazidi population live in a refugee camp. Organisations are not allowed inside the camp.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Instead, Lifting Hands provides lessons in a neighbouring park. We attended an English lesson for young women aged 14 - 17yrs old. Under the shade of a tree, the class spoke of their desire to become doctors, lawyers, and journalists.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Every single one of them without fail said they wanted to help others - that they know what it feels like to be alone and they never want anyone else to feel the same way.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camilla continued: 'Despite the absolute horror and inexplicable violence these women have seen, somehow they have chosen love over hatred.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Watching this group of ambitious, intelligent and compassionate individuals I was overwhelmed with sadness; they will not have the chance to live the life they deserve.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Praising the organisation running the lessons for the girls for doing an 'incredible job', Camilla explained how seeing them in action had reiterated for her the importance of helping others.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: 'Seeing the incredible difference it makes to the lives of the people in the camp reminded me how important it is to do something.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'No, we cannot do everything, we cannot repay the debt conflict leaves when it steals from innocent people's lives - but we can all in our own small way do something.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanying Camilla's post had been several pictures from the blonde beauty's last few days of her trip. She was seen bonding with the young girls she had met, as well as posing alongside boyfriend Jamie in their charity t-shirts.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her latest post comes after the humanitarian worker insisted she had been 'humbled' by her refugee camp visit.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous Instagram posts, Camilla and male model Jamie shared photos of them helping out at a homeless shelter in Thessalonik, as they revealed they will be making a short documentary to capture their trip on camera.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie had also treated his followers to a number of sweet videos of him playing games with the children on his own page.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and his girlfriend were seen preparing wraps for the refugees, clad in matching fundraising T-shirts with the words 'Choose Love' emblazoned across the front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple, who came second on ITV2's Love Island, then posed in front of a blackboard at the camp - which detailed the impressive amount of provisions they have provided over the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly overwhelmed by the day, Camilla accompanied the snaps with an emotional caption, which read: 'Today we were immensely humbled to join the Soul Food Kitchen team to help with the preparation and distribution of meals to homeless refugees in Thessaloniki.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We met the loveliest volunteers who are not only giving their time here, but are acting as powerful advocates back at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They have made the decision to #chooselove&nbsp;with @HelpRefugeesUK, and their efforts are making an incredible difference to wonderful people trapped in a desperate situation.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having announced they are making a short film about their time in the country, she then added to fans: 'The extremely talented @jamiejewitt_ is doing an amazing job of capturing footage of our time here, and we cannot wait to share it all with you.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the trip marking his first time helping out at such a location, it is no wonder Jamie, 27, was also keen to share his day with followers on social media.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking to his story on the site, he shared a snap of him standing in a marquee as he set up an obstacle course for the children - before posting a sweet video of him and Camilla racing round the track with the youngsters.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having displayed his musical talents on the reality series, the hunk then proceeded to teach the kids to play guitar, before they settled on the sofa to tell them stories for the rest of the afternoon.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added of his day: 'Today we were working with the #soulfoodkitchen prepping and packing meals which we then drove around and distributed throughout the streets of Thessaloniki.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We met multiple homeless refugees and visited their temporary homes, we were even cooked for after being given a tour of a particular groups makeshift settlement.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly emotional about the experience, he then added: 'What a day.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camilla and Jamie arrived at Greece's Nea Kavala relocation camp last week, where they planned to spend time helping with the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bomb disposal expert Camilla and her beau took to Instagram earlier this week to share snaps from their trip, with Camilla calling their time in Greece 'incredible' - amid reports some of their co-stars are charging thousands for nightclub appearances.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple have been volunteering with charity A Drop In The Ocean at the refugee camp, which is 20km from the Macedonian border, and are set to make a short film about the organisation's charity efforts.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overwhelmed by the experience, Camilla wrote on Instagram on Monday: 'Our whole trip has been coordinated by the amazing @hollypenalver founder of @indigovolunteers, and after an exceptional day one we are so excited to see what the rest of the week will bring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We will be keeping you updated on a daily basis, and will provide full information on how you can get involved in a short documentary when we get back.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the snaps, the couple could be seen distributing bags of food, water and clothing to the refugees present.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calvin Klein model Jamie added: 'I have never had such a rewarding experience.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camilla, who is rumoured to have dated Prince Harry, has previously hinted she would like to make documentaries about humanitarian causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their trip comes after the Mirror  reported their Love Island co-star Olivia Attwood is charging as much as &pound;10,000 for a public appearance, with winning couple Kem and Amber also raking in thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MailOnline has contacted a representative for Olivia for comment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple have been inseparable since leaving the villa, posting endless loved-up selfies on Instagram and documenting their time together.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite bagging herself a model on the series, Camilla has revealed she struggled with her body confidence while surrounded by her fellow swimwear-clad Islanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The softly-spoken reality star - who became the nation's sweetheart during her seven week stint in the Hidden Hills villa - admitted that she questioned her incredible petite frame while in Mallorca, alongside statuesque Olivia Attwood and Tyla Carr.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amanullah Hassan had no official training before he became a teacher in a secret school in Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya villagers set it up for their community after authorities imposed an apartheid system blocking them from being educated with their Buddhist neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His second teaching job, in a refugee camp in Bangladesh, was also in a semisecret school, a low-profile mud-walled building indistinguishable from the ordinary houses that surrounded it, inhabited by Rohingya refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first school built in Kutupalong camp in 2009 by the charity Children on the Edge was demolished by police and locals, who were angry that the refugees were receiving charity not given to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the introduction of an apartheid system in Burma's Rakhine state in 2012, Rohingya children were not allowed to learn their own language at school. They were taught Burmese and English but not Bengali, the formal language from which the Rohingya dialect is derived. &quot;It is ironic, given that the Burmese government's case is that these are Bengali invaders,&quot; John Littleton, from Children on the Edge, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when they set up their own schools, paid for by villagers, teachers such as Mr Hassan, 21, did not dare teach Bengali. Now Bangladeshi authorities are imposing the same restrictions on schools in the refugee camps after five years of them teaching Bengali alongside Burmese and English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children on the Edge struck a deal with the authorities to build schools for Bangladeshi communities first so that the one for refugees would be tolerated. It was largely thanks to the camp's commander, however, that the school at which Mr Hassan is teaching has stayed standing. After the first higher-profile bricks and mortar school was demolished it was he who recommended they think smaller. &quot;He said 'just build it like the houses and I won't say if you don't say',&quot; Mr Littleton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2010 they had built 18, by the next year 36 and a year later 45. That was supposed to be it until August, when a new exodus of Rohingya began across the border into Bangladesh, 60 per cent of them children. Children on the Edge is handing over its old schools to Unicef, the UN agency for children, as it sets about training teachers to run another 100 schools yet to be built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't get to go to school in Burma,&quot; Rafiq, 12, said. He came among one of the earlier waves fleeing Rakhine. His family left after his cousin was &quot;disappeared&quot; by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayesha Aktar, 19, who never learned Burmese, teaches Bengali to her charges. It is a job that will soon end unless the Bangladeshi government can be brought round. Learning Burmese might not seem an educational necessity here but Mohammed Rashid, who teaches it, views it as crucial if these children are ever to return to the country they call home. &quot;It is the language of their country,&quot; he said. &quot;If they want to achieve anything in Burma they will have to know Burmese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The books they use are the same as those in the Burmese government schools from which they are excluded. In Mr Rashid's class they are open at a page showing all the Burmese ethnic groups. These do not include Rohingya, a term the Burmese reject. &quot;There's no Muslims here,&quot; Humira, 10, notes, pointing at the open pages. &quot;We are here but we are not here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children in these schools are among the lucky few able to learn. Others can only wait in hope of their own chance, peeking through the holes in the mud walls while Humira and her friends pore over books from a country where they do not belong.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local residents and politicians have reacted with disgust after an Egyptian refugee spoke of his fear following a fire attack at his home in Edinburgh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father-of-four claims his family were the deliberate targets of a fire at a flat in Wester Hailes on Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family, who moved to Scotland last year, said it was one of a series of incidents against his family, including his young daughter's buggy being set alight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councillor Donald Wilson, culture and communities convener, said: &quot;I am appalled and saddened to think this fire may have been started deliberately and such acts have absolutely no place in our communities. Edinburgh is a diverse, culturally rich city and one of the safest places to live. Our refugee support network will be reaching out to the victims concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">READ MORE: Refugees targeted' in Wester Hailes fire attack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And culture and communities vice convenor Ian Campbell added: &quot;Racism, bigotry or any form of hate crime is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in Edinburgh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anyone has any information about this incident in the early hours of Saturday morning, I urge you to contact Police Scotland immediately to help them with their investigation. We can only be thankful that no one was hurt, in this instance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, who does not wish to be named, said: &quot;I heard about Scottish people, they're friendly and welcoming to people from different countries and different cultures, never thought this was going to happen with us in Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My wife, she used to wear niqab but she took it off because she is scared. We can't feel safe nowhere, it's just a disappointment really.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every day things are getting worse than ever, honestly, we don't feel safe at all, my kids can't sleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local community were also quick to hit out at the &quot;horrific&quot; incident in a bid to show refugees and visitors the city is a welcoming place to live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jainus Areebas said: &quot;I hope this does not put the refugees that are yet to come off, Edinburgh is a welcoming place for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And James Kelso added on Facebook: &quot;The lowlife underbelly of Scotland. Looking for someone to blame for their miserable lives. They likely find their courage in the bottom of a bottle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scottish Labour's inequalities spokesperson Monica Lennon MSP called the attack &quot;cowardly&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Refugees fleeing for their lives deserve safety and sanctuary when they come to Scotland. This cowardly attack which Police Scotland is treating as deliberate fire-raising will horrify decent people across the county. Community leaders must ensure that resources and plans are in place to support integration and to overcome the fear and hate that seeks to divide us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Police Scotland said: &quot;Police in Edinburgh are appealing for information after a common stair within a block of flats was set alight in the early hours of September 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At around 2.12am on Saturday police and fire services were called to flats after a resident reported the fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, there were no injuries and no evacuations were necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Det Insp Bruce Coutts of Corstorphine CID added: &quot;We are treating this as a deliberate fireraising incident and are carrying out inquiries in the local area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone with information is asked to contact police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr Graeme Bruce and Cllr Susan Webber stated, &quot;We are aware that Police Scotland is investigating this as a deliberate fire-raising. And if indeed it is uncovered that this was an intentional and targeted act then we can only be thankful that due to the quick mindedness and vigilance of the residents in raising the alarm that no one was injured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr Webber stated further, &quot;All the residents that I met during my campaign and since my election have spoken about their willingness in welcoming and assisting new families settle into this community, I was genuinely shocked to hear of this event&quot;. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greece is experiencing a dramatic rise in the number of refugees and migrants entering the country, exacerbating already deplorable living conditions on island camps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'Europe's dirty secret': officials on Chios scramble to cope with rising tensions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people arriving, across land and sea borders, has more than doubled since the beginning of the summer. Authorities estimate arrivals are now at their highest level since March 2016, with over 200 men, women and children being registered every day. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is dramatic and it is the most vulnerable of the vulnerable coming in,&quot; said Elias Pavlopoulos, who heads M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res in Greece. &quot;There are whole families fleeing war zones in Syria and Iraq. In the last few months our clinics have seen more people who have suffered violence, who are victims of rape, who have been tortured, than ever before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a pledge by EU member states in September 2015 to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers - including 106,000 from Greece and Italy - a mere 29,000 have been moved to other European countries so far. With the 28-nation bloc failing to meet the deadline set out in its own plan, mass demonstrations are expected in capitals across Europe this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees and migrants have been arriving in Greece not only on rickety boats from Turkey but by foot across the frontier between the two countries. On Wednesday, police announced 37 refugees - including 19 children - from Iraq, Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan, had been dumped by smugglers on the national highway outside Thessaloniki. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights groups are increasingly likening the situation to 2015, when, at the height of the migrant crisis that engulfed Europe, Greece saw close to a million people enter the country on onward journeys that often took them to Germany. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're living the days of 2015,&quot; said Pantelis Dimitriou from Iliaktida, a local NGO on Lesbos operating accommodation and support centres for the newly arrived. &quot;The flows have become huge. From around 50 to 60 in early July they are now at more than 200 every day. Maybe it is the German elections, maybe it is about Turkey's [worsening] relations with the EU, or maybe this is the last push before winter, but something is going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More worrying is the number of minors making the often treacherous journey to get to Greece. In a statement this week, Save the Children said around 40% of the new arrivals were under the age of 18. Over 1,500 unaccompanied minors are currently on waiting lists in Greece to be housed in child shelters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visiting Athens for the screening of Sea Sorrow, a 73-minute documentary depicting the plight of refugees, directed by the British actor Vanessa Redgrave, the Labour peer Alf Dubs voiced his dismay. As the architect of a scheme announced last year to bring up to 3,000 child refugees to the UK, the increasingly febrile situation was deeply troubling, he said. Despite 40 children being eligible for transfer, none has taken place in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am convinced the Greeks need far more help than they are getting from the international community,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;There simply aren't the facilities or resources here to accommodate new arrivals. The least we should do in the UK is speed up the process of accepting children with families in Britain.&quot; Some unaccompanied minors were &quot;in utter despair, their lives on hold, waiting desperately for news&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Abandoned and abused: the forgotten Syrian refugee children in a Greek island detention camp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee flows dropped dramatically when a landmark accord aimed at stopping the influx was reached between the EU and Turkey in March 2016. In return for (EURO)6bn (&pound;5.26bn) in aid - around (EURO)2bn every year - Ankara agreed to beef up patrols along its Aegean coast and, where necessary, turn back smuggler boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest surge is placing growing strain on Greece's eastern Aegean islands where reception centres in Lesbos, Chios, Kos, Leros and Samos are vastly overstretched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 60,000 people are marooned in Greece. Some 13,352 men, women and children, unable to move since the EU-Turkey deal was signed, are currently stranded on the islands, according to figures released by the Greek interior ministry on Thursday. Riots and violent outbursts in camps are common. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lesbos, the island on the frontline of the human drama in 2015, the main camp at Moria is currently at twice its holding capacity with 4,825 people registered. The centre is equipped to house no more than 1,800 according to the United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR. &quot;In November last year we had reached a point where in Moria there were no more people living in tents,&quot; said Dimitriou. &quot;That was when we had a cycle of arrivals and departures, some coming but others also being transferred to the mainland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions were made worse by the &quot;bottleneck&quot; that appeared as a result of refugee reunifications and relocations slowing down dramatically. &quot;It's like a perfect storm,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frustration has mounted amid donor fatigue and growing difficulty accessing funds to meet the increasing need for humanitarian aid on frontline islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the state of emergency imposed at the height of the crisis officially rescinded, the Greek government assumed responsibility for services provided to asylum seekers in August, spurring NGOs to leave altogether. Authorities say around 99% of those who make it to Greece request asylum. &quot;The Greek state moves very, very slowly,&quot; said Dimitriou. &quot;It's impossible to address needs as they should be addressed.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editorial</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">766 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spain has been a model of solidarity in the three days since the terror attacks that killed 14 people in Barcelona and Cabrils. That number is now known to include the seven-year-old Julian Cadman, who had dual British-Australian nationality and whose engaging image has been on front pages. He&nbsp;had been missing since the savage vehicle attack on Thursday afternoon. On Sunday morning the king and queen led the mourners at a service in La Sagrada Familia, Barcelona's cathedral, which, perhaps paradoxically in the circumstances, was conceived by Antoni Gaud&iacute; as a paeon to faith and nationalism. More than 1,500 people packed the church, while nearby Las Ramblas continued to be a&nbsp;focus for grief and resistance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But behind the solidarity, Spain's national cohesion faces more stresses than in most European countries. At least eight of the terrorists appear to have grown up in one small town, Ripoll. Their horrified families are blaming Abdelbaki Es Satty, the imam of one of the town's mosques, for radicalising their sons. The small community, where one in 10 residents is a migrant, is in a state of shock to discover that football-loving kids who appeared entirely comfortable with their Spanish identity set out on such a murderous course. Police, who are investigating what they now say was a plot to launch a huge terror attack, are trying to establish whether the imam died in a gas explosion that destroyed a house last Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet this is a region that is uncomfortably familiar with conflicts of identity. Catalonia's president, Carles Puigdemont, attended the Sunday service with the king and queen, but it was a rare joint appearance with the monarchs for the republican politician, who is the architect of the unofficial referendum on independence that is scheduled to take place in less than six weeks' time. Madrid continues to insist the plebiscite is illegal and that it will do everything it can to stop it happening. The last Catalan president who organised a similar referendum has been banned from public office for two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's attack is likely to be used by Madrid to add to the pressure on the regional government. The argument has already been rehearsed in the national capital's newspaper El Pa&iacute;s, which said it was a wake-up call for the Catalan government, described independence as a fantasy and called on the&nbsp;regional politicians to &quot;ditch the democratic nonsense ... and start working for our real&nbsp;interests&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are plenty of people, not just in the darker corners of social media, who believe there is a link between terror and refugees. Late last year, Europol reported Islamic State was deliberately trying to radicalise vulnerable refugees in order to inflame the migration crisis and turn EU citizens against refugees seeking asylum. That makes the challenge Barcelona faces now, to sustain the qualities of a multicultural cosmopolitanism, the youthful and open approach that has made it so beloved, the more important. It has a fine record: its recent hostility to rapidly growing tourism, partly aggravated by the way Airbnb has driven up rents in the city, is more than matched - as banners during anti-tourism protests showed - by its readiness to welcome refugees. It describes itself as a &quot; refugee city &quot; and it has an impressive plan for comprehensive reception and resettlement facilities. But Barcelona's offer of welcome is not shared absolutely everywhere in Spain, and, last week, the UN refugee agency warned the country was struggling to cope with the 9,300 refugees who have already arrived this year. That number will only increase as the route from Libya becomes ever more dangerous and some of the tens of thousands who risk the crossing to Italy seek a safer route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The past year has seen terror strike half a dozen European countries. Events in Spain were still unfolding when a man went on the rampage in the Finnish town of Turku, murdering two women. His ethnicity, like that of the Spanish terrorists, was Moroccan. These brutal murders have played a part in poisoning the atmosphere against migrants. While Angela Merkel of Germany stoutly upholds her commitment to refugees, the EU collectively has failed at every turn, unable even to ensure that members honour the commitments they have already made to ease the burden on the frontline states of Greece and Italy. This is a desperate tragedy for millions fleeing endemic violence and insecurity. It threatens, too, the precious cohesion of neighbourhoods. And it is a kind of victory for the terrorists of all sides who seek to undermine Europe's universal values.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They came across in packed boats, some were chased out of their homes by machine-gun wielding men others and another sent here by his mum when he was just six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now refugees have described escaping their war-torn countries to find safety and freedom on British soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Red Cross travelled up and down the country during Refugee Week to give a voice to asylum seekers who owe this country so much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They heard how Mohammed crossed treacherous seas in a small boat crammed with 50 people, while Henry, a 93-year-old Jewish German, came to the UK as a child on the kindertransport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Marzia left Afghanistan she was a court judge and in Kenya, Jacob was a professional footballer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether in Liverpool, Bristol, London, Glasgow or Oldham, these people have all experienced the immense challenge of moving to a new country, growing up among unfamiliar cultures and creating a new life from nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resettlement of refugees has long been a part of British history and in a series of intimate conversations, they tell of their impressions of their new home and hopes for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Everton in the Community hub, in Walton, runs weekly football sessions for refugees and asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coach Lee Johnson runs the sessions alongside Toffees legend Pat Van Den Hauwe and one of his pupils is 21-year-old Jacob Vieira, a former professional footballer from Kenya as well Syrian refugees Abdul, 27, and Orhan, 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here Jacob discusses how football sessions helped him to settle in the UK as well as his hopes for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacob said: &quot;Football has been a massive helps because, like, you know more people, different people, and coming from a different country to a new area where you completely know no one and football brings us all together and playing. It's a social thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apart from meeting new people, it's helped us do some different courses, like football courses, like FA Level 1, refereeing courses and, therefore, we are preparing to go to FA Level 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Knowing other people helps a lot, not just at football, but on and off the pitch so it's brilliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At first when I came, you know, the impression... they say in Liverpool the people are Scousers so the English was a bit difficult to understand but now, having met different people, getting social with other people, I'm now like used to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it now easy with the English and it's been okay for me. Liverpool people are truly the best people in the world, that's what I can say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My dream actually is being a professional footballer. Hopefully, from next season on I will be somewhere, from League 2, League 1, who knows? But my dream is to be a professional footballer. That's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry, who lives with his wife Ingrid in Giffnock, Glasgow, left Nuremberg, Germany, in May 1939 aged 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sent on kindertransport to the UK by his mother, he came to Glasgow under the care of an elderly woman who had previously looked after a cousin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ingrid left Dortmund in July 1939 and was settled in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After writing letters home to his mother in Germany through an aunt in Brussels, the then teenage Henry was put on trial in the High Court in Edinburgh for corresponding with the enemy and was imprisoned before being interred on the Isle of Man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was eventually released because he was under the legal age to be interred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ingrid ended up in Glasgow as there was no work in Leicestershire and, not allowed to work in munitions, she put her sewing skills to use for the war effort, sewing collars onto army uniforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry and Ingrid met in Glasgow at a Jewish refugee club when they were 18. Two years later, they married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the war they set up a successful catering business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conjunction with the Holocaust Survivors Trust and the Association of Jewish Refugees, the couple still regularly give talks to schools and have told their story to the Scottish Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry was made an MBE in 1998 for his work with The Limbless British Ex-Servicemen's Association - here he describes the traumatic journey and his subsequent wartime arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry said: &quot;The journey was horrendous. The children, as young as six who had never been away from their mum and dad before I was howling, crying. You can imagine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The train was packed. There must have been between 150 to 200 hundred children. In these days the railway station was a black hole and we were sitting the cellar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People came, British people, who wanted to take a refugee child, they came to pick one so it was fantastic that we all found somewhere to go. But it was pretty traumatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the war started I was classed as an adult, 16. I had to register as an alien and had an alien's registration book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had an uncle and aunt in Brussels; both were German Jewish refugees. They had settled in Brussels so I had wrote to my uncle in Brussels: 'Can you send this letter to my mum?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it went backwards and forth. That, of course, is now wartime, there's censorship and these letters were opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I was arrested for corresponding with the enemy which at wartime was a fairly serious offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were many young people all coming from an oppressed country and integrating here but trying to find a way out of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We gave concerts in aid of Mrs Churchill's Aid to Russia fund, to keep the war effort going and we were young.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is where I met Ingrid and, eventually, quite a few of us got married. We got married reasonable early, 20, but there was nothing to wait for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's never upset me, being a refugee. I belong still to an association, an association of Jewish refugees and people say we should change our name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, look, this is what we were. We are now British citizens, Scottish citizens, we feel at home here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But nevertheless, we were refugees and I think it's an honourable thing to be. It's not something to be discarded. We were refugees and we were being welcomed here which was the main thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We found asylum and we were given a chance. We were allowed to settle down, work, create a job, have a family and prosper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meena, 56, arrived in the UK in October 1972 as a result of the expulsion of Ugandan Asians by political leader and military officer Idi Amin, who served as President of Uganda from 1971 to 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She travelled to the UK with her father, sister and brother, and was kept in a refugee centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, Meena was resettled in London. She is now married with two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meena said: &quot;Coming to England, life wasn't that easy for us. We struggled quite a lot. My brother had to leave his education and go and try and help the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kept on saying to my father that I will never go back to Uganda. I, just, I was scared to be honest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, I feel, you know, life has completely changed. I feel more settled. I have a job; I have work and I'm happier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, you know, that opportunity was given to me by this country. Had it not been given, I'd don't know where or what would have happened to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marzia Babakarkhail, 51, a former family court judge and advocate of education for girls and women, left Afghanistan for a new life in Oldham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marzia was supported by the British Red Cross when she came to the UK and has since volunteered for the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having come to Oldham with little English, she learned the language and now works for local MP Debbie Abrahams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I came in this country, I left behind everything,&quot; Marzia said. &quot;I lost my career, my identity and my status of life. Everything. I was an educated person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was a family court judge. In 1994, I became an activist as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I was a judge I felt there was no justice around women in my country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I established a small shelter for divorced women. Fighting for freedom, fighting for education, fighting for justice. All my aim was to help women and that put me in the headlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I suppose I've got quite a good imagination and I can put myself in the shoes of people who've lost everything and come here and miss so much about their homeland. I can feel with them and want to help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oldham is full of kind people. The first time you see people with passion, with kindness, that is big, a good start in Oldham for me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I count Oldham as my home, it's my second home, proudly, and Oldham people is like my family now because they stand for me in the good days and the bad days. It's very important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They cried with me; they laughed with me. They appreciated me; they gave me lots of love. It's a big thing really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bristol, a group of former British Red Cross service users gathered at the Avon Gorge Hotel at Clifton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees Jamal Rasouli, from Iran, Zeinab Abdelrahman, from Sudan, Mohammed Osman, from Eritrea, and Qerim Nuredini, from Kosovo, have all been supported by the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed is now a service administrator and said: &quot; I didn't have a choice. I had to take this journey, regardless of how difficult or dangerous it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, it was midnight - 45 or 50 people in a small boat - and we crossed after five hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't know which way you're going. The sea, a very small boat, water coming, all the waves coming and water going inside. It was really horrible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I like in this country is, to be honest, you have your own identity, you have your own culture, your own belief, but you're still the same. Everyone is the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qerim now works for the Red Cross as a refugee services manager in Bristol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The Serbians started to revenge on to Albanians so they decided to ethnically cleanse the whole country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, they came to our house and they ordered us to leave the house and there were a lot of military vehicles, machine guns and what have you. It really reminded us of the footage we used to watch of the Holocaust during the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, when we came here, we were quite overwhelmed with everything that had happened. We were quite happy to be safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I've found interesting when I came home, trying to compare my life back home and here, back home we are a very mono-cultural society. I lived there for 26 years and never met an African person, a black person in my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THESE are the refugees forced to flee their homelands due to war and persecution who make up the first ever team of displaced athletes to compete at the World Championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With &quot;no home, no flag and no national anthem&quot;, the five-strong squad competes under the banner of athletics' governing body, the IAAF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of them will be in action tonight with Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu, 18, and Rose Nathike Lokonyen, 22 - who both fled war in South Sudan as children - competing in the men's 1500m and women's 800m respectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are keen to remind fans that they are athletes in their own right and had to achieve minimum race times required by the IAAF to qualify for the championships. Angelina Nadi, 23, who raced in the women's 1500m heats on Friday, set a personal best while Ahmed Bashir Farah, 20, also achieved a personal record, finishing less than four tenths of a second behind the pack in the men's 800m heats on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the competition, the team will return to their training camp home in the Ngong Hills, run by the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team was formed last February after founder and former long-distance runner Tegla Loroupe went into the Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps where they once lived and held trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night Kadar Omar Abdullahi , 21, raced his hero Mo Farah in the 5000m heats, keeping pace with the pack and setting a personal best of 14.32.67. Farah's time was 13.30.18, ensuring qualification in Saturday's final, his last race before retiring from the track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The athletes today told of wanting to inspire and highlight the plight of more than 65 million world-wide refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All were separated from their families at a young age, with some still not knowing what happened to their rela-tives. Nathike Lokonyen found out only last week that her aunt had died as a result of the war in South Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The athletes and coaches have travelled to London thanks to flights and accommodation paid for by the IAAF, More than 25 refugees at the training base attempted to make the minimum times, with just the five qualifying. A refugee team competed at last year's Rio Olympics, but this is the first time the five have competed at this level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founder Tegla Loroupe said: &quot;Before we came we were received very well in Kenya by the British embassy. They made it very easy for us to come and compete and already we were made to feel at home by the British.&quot; Team manager Ladislav Demko, 43, a former triathlete, said: &quot;Sport is a way out for them. When they step into the stadium, they don't feel like refugees any more. These people literally ran away on their feet from fear of death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'MY LIFE HAS CHANGED NOW': MEET THE TEAM AHMED BASHIR FARAH, 20 SOMALIA, 800m Ahmed Bashir Farah and his mother left Somalia when he was six and crossed the border into Kenya, where they found a home. But in 2014 his mother was deported, leaving him alone. Since then the athletics team has been like a family to the runner, who said: &quot;We left because of the government situation there; there was no peace. My life has changed now that I can compete and I can see Mo Farah. He is my hero. It's very emotional because I don't know where my family are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANGELINA NADI, 23 SOUTH SUDAN, 1500m Angelina Nadi was seven when she fled her native South Sudan. She has been in a refugee camp in Kenya since 2002. She said: &quot;I went with a [distant] relative because the war broke out. I followed them to get to safety and for a chance to go to school. From that moment I lost contact with them [my immediate family]. Everything was destroyed where our house was.&quot; She added: &quot;I now have hope that one day I will attain the level of some of the other athletes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOMINIC LOKINYOMO LOBALU, 18 SOUTH SUDAN, 1500m Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu remembers soldiers storming his home in South Sudan before his family decided to flee the country's civil war. After becoming separated from his family, he found himself in an orphanage. He does not like to go into the detail of his hardship, but he eventually fled to a refugee camp in neighbouring Kenya where he met his teammates. He said: &quot;It has been difficult because my family dispersed and I have not seen my parents since I left. Running means I have a future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROSE NATHIKE LOKONYEN, 22 SOUTH SUDAN, 800m Rose Nathike Lokonyen fled her home in South Sudan at the age of eight. She and her family went to a nearby town in 2002 but then she and her nine siblings became separated from her parents. They eventually made it across the border to Kenya. She said: &quot;I left home with my younger siblings but not my parents. It is horrible back home. I found out my aunt was killed last week. It is not safe.&quot; But she added: &quot;I feel very excited to be here in London. Sport has given me a better quality of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KADAR OMAR ABDULLAHI, 21 ETHIOPIA, 5000m Kadar Omar Abdullahi left his native Ethiopia with his uncle and brother aged 13 and travelled to a refugee camp in Kenya, but does not wish to share his story. He said: &quot;Mo Farah is someone I Iook up to and one day I want to be like him. It was horrible growing up and I had a lot of challenges, but running is something that has given me hope. I don't know why we left home, but there is no fear now and I hope one day I will be a champion and that my dream will come true.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Defend Europe, which is made up of a network of young anti-immigrant and anti-Islam activists, hailed their trip as a success despite the vessel spending less than a week monitoring the sea by Libya where hundreds of thousands of migrants have been rescued in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crew who chartered a 422-tonne vessel called the C-Star for their latest effortsaimed to send refugees &quot;back to Africa&quot; by harassing and blocking search and rescue vessels run by NGOs but were not successful in achieving their goal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, Defend Europe has been a political success. Only two months ago, many NGOs sailed in front of the Libyan coasts, like cabs waiting for customers,&quot; the group said in a statement. &quot;Today, there is only one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-refugee ship stopped in Suez Canal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGO vessels working off Libya have reduced activities in the wake of the Libyan and Italian authorities decision to curb their activities and in direct response to a decrease in the number of migrant boats departing Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boat's voyage has been plagued by a long string of humiliating hitches that saw it delayed by several weeks. Thelaunch was switched to Cyprus from Sicilywhere anti-racist campaigners and journalists had assembled last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vessel, hired by the movement after it raised more than (EURO)75,000 (&pound;67,000) through crowdfunding, set sail fromDjibouti in early July andhad intended to dock in Catania, Sicily. However itwas stopped from doing so after the mayor of Catania, Enzo Bianco, urged the city's port authorities to deny the ship docking rights. Plans to refuel in Greece and Tunisia were also ruined by local opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, the boat was stopped in the Suez Canal after the captain failed to produce a satisfactory crew list, before travelling to northern Cyprus, where crew members were arrested over people smuggling allegations. They were later released after claiming Sri Lankan crew members on board were &quot;apprentice sailors&quot; who were supposed to disembark in Egypt. Ironically this increasedthe list of asylum-seekers the mission was supposed to reduce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the month, volunteers on a German refugee rescue ship were deployed to help them after theywere apparently informed Defend Europe's boat had endured amechanical failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The originally stated aim of the Defend Europe vigilante-style&quot;mission&quot;, which is supported by former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke, was to actively block search and rescue (SAR) NGO ships who rescue refugees and migrants from sinking boats and dinghies. However, they later said they were changing approach, claiming they would&quot;monitor&quot; the situation and intervene should they see wrongdoing by the NGOs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has included blockading roads around Calais, occupying mosques, clashing with leftists and already trying to block an NGO ship in Sicily.The movement can be traced back to France in 2002 when the far-right Bloc Identitaire party set up a youth wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 90,000 refugees and migrants, the majority of them sub-Saharan Africans, have been rescued and brought to Italy so far. More than 2,400 people have died attempting the treacherous Central Mediterranean crossing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of Rohingya refugees who have fled from Burma to Bangladesh nears 300,000, the UN refugee agency said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure jumped from the previous estimate of 164,000 on Thursday, and by another 20,000 in one day, after the agency found thousands more refugees in border areas. It is thought that about a third of the Rohingya population has fled amid the latest violence, caused by clashes between militants from the stateless Muslim minority and government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Tripura, a spokesman for the UN refugee agency, said: &quot;Some 290,000 Rohingya arrived in Bangladesh since August 25.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya militants were suspected of killing 12 Burmese soldiers and government forces are accused of massacring entire villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aung San Suu Kyi, who became leader of Burma after 30 years under house arrest for agitating for democracy, has been heavily criticised for failing to address the Rohingya people's plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first remarks about the crisis, she said there was &quot;an iceberg of misinformation&quot;. However, her government has been accused of limiting access to journalists and aid workers in Rakhine province, where the violence is taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has been condemned by fellow Nobel peace prize laureates. Desmond Tutu called on Ms Suu Kyi to speak out against the &quot;unfolding horror&quot; and &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; in Burma, warning: &quot;If the political price of your ascension to the highest office is your silence, the price is surely too steep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday the activist Malala Yousafzai signed an open letter calling for an end to the violence. In December she was among 11 Nobel peace laureates warning of &quot;the potential for genocide&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An online petition calling for Ms Suu Kyi's prize to be revoked has 390,000 signatures. However, the Nobel Institute said that nothing in the foundation's rules provided for the honour to be withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has warned that the treatment of the Rohingya people could constitute ethnic cleansing. &quot;It can be the precursor to all the egregious crimes - and I mean genocide,&quot; Adama Dieng, the UN special envoy for the prevention of genocide, said. &quot;We are not yet there, but it is time to take action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International reported last night that the Burmese army had planted landmines along the border, and that several refugees had been maimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predominantly Buddhist Burma claims that the Rohingya are Bangladeshi; Bangladesh considers them Burmese. The issue of Rohingya refugees has dominated relations between the countries for decades. Between 1991 and 1992, about 250,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh to escape persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee camps in eastern Bangladesh are overwhelmed, the UN said. One site has doubled its population to 70,000 since the end of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of new arrivals are women, including mothers with newborn babies, the UN said. &quot;They arrive exhausted, hungry and desperate for shelter.&quot; At least a thousand Rohingya are thought to have died crossing into Bangladesh in the past fortnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dipayan Bhattacharyya, acting World Food Programme (WFP) head in Bangladesh, described the situation as &quot;volatile&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We started with planning for an influx of 120,000. Then we made a resource planning for 300,000. The current influx has almost now reached 300,000. Now the WFP and the other UN agencies on the ground may have to review it again if the influx continues unabated,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that hungry Rohingya were running towards any food trucks that arrived in the area. &quot;People are very desperate to get whatever assistance they can get in terms of food, shelter and water. They are deprived of everything. They are desperate for just basic survival,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs from all the main parties have urged the Government to act &quot;without delay&quot; on its pledge on protecting child refugees, after it emerged that children as young as 10 were enduring freezing temperatures sleeping rough across Europe. In a letter to Home Secretary Amber Rudd, the 150 signatories - including 54 MPs, 61 Lords, as well as bishops, councillors and NGOs - ask that all 480 places promised for unaccompanied minors under the Dubs Amendment are filled before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family reunions for lone children with family in Britain should be accelerated, they said, adding that youngsters who are currently waiting many months to access this legal route are often falling into the hands of smugglers and traffickers. The renewed appeal comes after the first unaccompanied child stranded in Greece arrived in the UK - a year and a half after the Home Office pledged to bring hundreds to safety. The Home Office had accepted that the boy was vulnerable and eligible for transfer 16 months ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the demolition of the Calais &quot;Jungle&quot; in October 2016, the UK gave sanctuary to 200 children under the Dubs provision. But since then, no children have been transferred from the north of France under the legislation. This is despite the fact that there are an estimated 100 lone minors currently sleeping rough in Calais. Volunteers working on the ground say one of them, an unaccompanied Afghan boy, is just 10-years-old, and is currently sleeping between two trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an onslaught of freezing temperatures last week and pressure from charities, the authorities in Calais opened sheltered accommodation in a warehouse with capacity for a total of 270 people. But with between 600 and 700 refugees in the area, many are still having to sleep outside in the rain and snow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annie Gavrilescu, who is working on the ground in Calais with charity Help Refugees, which also signed the letter to Ms Rudd, told The Independent: &quot;It's really, really freezing. There's a lot of snow and rain. It's not the nice kind of snow; it's bitter cold and miserable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't sleep very much in the night. It's impossible - it's too cold and wet. And then they've also got police often coming and removing any makeshift shelters they've made. We're seeing signs of hyperthermia - people are very pale, sometimes they have slurred speech and get very faint. You can definitely sense how the mood has gone down even further. It's just really desperate and despondent. We've always said we want the places filled by the time this big freeze comes. It's now here, and kids as young as 10 are having to sleep outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter says: &quot;In light of the current detrimental situation in Calais, a continued commitment by our Government to its legal obligation to fulfil the Dubs Amendment appears to be more important than ever. The previous transfer of 200 children in 2016 proves that our Home Office and our Government are able and willing to follow a proud tradition of being a safe haven for child refugees. Knowing that at least four children lost their lives last year at our border in Calais before the Amendment was implemented is heartbreaking, and we cannot let this happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are writing to ask that you ensure further safe transfers to the UK as swiftly as possible to fill the 480 capacity, and to urge the Government to provide swift access to family reunion so that children do not have to risk their lives to reach protection and their families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter also urges that the EU-Turkey deal eligibility deadline of 20 March 2016 be reconsidered, as currently only children who arrived in Europe before this date are considered eligible under Dubs - meaning many who arrived more recently are not being considered for the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Involvement in anti-exploitation and anti-trafficking efforts in northern France must also be renewed and reinforced, the signatories state, claiming the UK has a duty to safeguard refugees from the dangers posed by exploitative criminal networks before they reach Britain. Recent research by Refugee Rights Data Project indicates that the majority of child refugees in Calais are facing sustained and increasingly brutal forms of police violence as well as abuse by civilians, with many also suffering from untreated mental and physical health problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent revealed earlier this year that refugees in the region had been subject to aggressive use of tear gas and repeated destruction of possessions at the hands of local police, whose conduct was recently condemned by the French government following an independent inquiry. The growing desperation of displaced children, many of whom have family members in the UK, has made them increasingly prone to exploitation at the hands of smugglers and traffickers, who are said to promise them a free crossing in return for &quot;work&quot; upon arrival in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the letter, a Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;We remain committed to transferring 480 children from Europe to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act. We have accepted further referrals this year and transfers are ongoing. We will continue to work closely with EU partners and local authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In addition, our wider focus remains helping those in need of international protection in the region, which is why we have committed to resettle up to 23,000 refugees from the region - more than 9,000 are already rebuilding their lives in the UK - and the Government has pledged &pound;2.46bn to the humanitarian response to the Syria conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Satellite photographs have revealed that Muslim Rohingya villages in Burma were destroyed after the country's government reached an agreement supposed to allow refugees to return home peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 40 villages were attacked in October and November, according to analysis of the images by Human Rights Watch (HRW), based in New York. This brings to 354 the number of settlements partially or completely razed in the campaign of arson, murder and rape by the Burmese security forces after an attack by Rohingya militants at the end of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close to 700,000 people are understood to have fled since then to Bangladesh, the largest so far in a wave of mass emigrations by the Rohingya, who have been persecuted and denied citizenship in Burma for decades.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total number of refugees in Bangladesh - close to one million - is now greater than the number who remain in their Burmese homeland, Rakhine state. The problem is putting intense pressure on the Bangladeshi government, which last month reached an agreement to begin returning refugees to Burma early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights groups and aid organisations, as well as many Rohingya, have expressed scepticism about the sincerity of the Burmese authorities, who have been accused by the United Nations of ethnic cleansing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Burmese army's destruction of Rohingya villages within days of signing a refugee repatriation agreement with Bangladesh shows that commitments to safe returns were just a public relations stunt. The satellite imagery shows what the Burmese army denies: that Rohingya villages continue to be destroyed,&quot; said Brad Adams of HRW. &quot;Burmese government pledges to ensure the safety of returning Rohingya cannot be taken seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial satellite images analysed by HRW disprove a claim by Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto Burmese leader, that conflicts in Rakhine ended on September 5. At least 118 villages have been at least partially destroyed since that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 23 Bangladesh and Burma agreed to return refugees to Rakhine. The satellite photographs, however, show that between November 25 and December 2 at least four villages in Maungdaw township were burnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bimal Chandra Dey Sarker, of the Bangladeshi aid organisation Mukti, said that between 60,000 and 70,000 more Rohingya had crossed into Bangladesh this month alone. &quot;The recent arrivals say that even if their villages are intact, they can't buy essentials in the markets,&quot; he said in the town of Cox's Bazar, close to the vast refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The vendors have been told not to sell food to Rohingya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crackdown followed attacks by members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army on August 25 that killed a few dozen people. The response was described by Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the UN human rights chief, as &quot;a textbook example of ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the BBC to be shown tonight he hinted that Ms Suu Kyi could face future charges of genocide. He said that he telephoned the Nobel peace prize winner last January to beg her personally to bring an end to persecution of the Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I appealed to her emotional standing to do whatever she could to bring this to a close,&quot; he told BBC's Panorama. &quot;To my great regret this didn't seem to happen. The elements suggest you cannot rule out the possibility that acts of genocide have been committed. Given the scale of the military operation, clearly these would have to be decisions taken at a high level.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International artists including Richard Mosse and Candice Breitz have joined protests calling for the National Gallery of Victoria to drop its contract with Wilson Security, which provided services at offshore detention facilities on Manus Island and Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The artists renamed or changed their exhibiting works and activists disrupted Thursday night's VIP preview of the Triennial, a major art and design exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosse, a Prix Pictet-winning artist, called for an immediate end to Wilson's contract with NGV: &quot;I understand that the decision to hire Wilson Security on an interim basis was not made by the museum, but by a state panel, and that during the tendering process the gallery cannot legally respond to this statement.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Behrouz Boochani wins Amnesty International award for writing from Manus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mosse said he and his collaborators, Trevor Tweeten and Ben Frost stood &quot;in solidarity with the Artists' Committee, who call for the immediate termination of the Wilson contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosse altered his one of his works on refugees - a sixteen, flat-panel video grid showing conditions inside Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos - to include a statement from Kurdish human rights activist, filmmaker and refugee Behrouz Boochani, who is detained on Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has sent us a video statement by smartphone which we will install within our exhibit as a gesture to remind viewers of the museum's ongoing and unacceptable relationship with Wilson Security,&quot; Mosse said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosse praised the Triennial's &quot;extraordinary curation&quot; that showed the NGV was committed to raising awareness about the plight of refugees around the world, and said the gallery's support was key to getting his vast film installation, Incoming, made. It documents the flight of refugees in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson Security has been contracted to the NGV since July, after the gallery's former security company was dumped over a wage scandal in May. But the company has been subject to serious allegations of sexual assault and violence against refugees and asylum seekers, including children and women, in its time contracted to detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, the NGV released a statement clarifying that Wilson Security was the gallery's &quot;interim security service provider&quot;, chosen by the Victorian government security services panel. It said it was &quot;in the process of securing a long-term security services provider, who will be selected and appointed through a public tender process as part of a revised Victorian government security services panel later this year&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 2016, Guardian Australia's investigation into the Nauru Files revealed incident reports detailing allegations of Wilson employees assaulting asylum seekers and refugees, sexually assaulting women and children, and attacking and choking children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The files also suggested the company had been routinely downgrading incident reports of self-harm and sexual abuse made by other companies, and had failed to disclose at least 16 cases of sexual violence and child abuse during a Senate inquiry into abuses in offshore detention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company told the inquiry: &quot;Wilson Security is committed to providing a security service... that supports the wellbeing of asylum seekers and minimises harm. Our work is supported by a set of robust policies, procedures and processes, which ensure that we continually reduce the number, type and severity of incidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson announced in 2016 it would no longer work in offshore detention at the expiration of its existing contract, which ended in October 2017. However, the company reportedly remains working on both Nauru and PNG. Wilson Security was approached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African artist Candice Breitz also has work in the Triennial. Her video installation features Hollywood actors Julianne Moore and Alec Baldwin giving voice to the stories of six refugees who fled oppressive conditions in their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breitz announced this week she was changing the name of the piece from Love Story to Wilson Must Go, effective until the NGV severs its contract with Wilson security. She invited other contributing artists to do the same. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The horrific effects of indefinite mandatory detention are well-documented,&quot; Breitz wrote in a Facebook post titled Why I'm Sabotaging My Own Work. &quot;The allegations against Wilson Security since the commencement of their contracts on Manus Island and Nauru in 2012 are extensive and disturbing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blockade of the entrance to the NGV on Thursday is the latest in a recent string of actions taken by the Artists Committee: a collective of artists and arts workers who are protesting the NGV's contract with the security company, which began after the gallery's former security company was dumped over a wage scandal in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small group of protesters with an anti-Wilson Security sign were at two of the main entrances on Thursday evening, and police were nearby. Some groups of VIP guests were ferried into an alternate entrance, but patrons who approached the blockade were handed flyers from Artists Against Abuse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to assure you that our protest is not directed at at you [patrons], the artists, or individual security staff members, but at Wilson Security, the NGV governance and, by consequence, the state government,&quot; the flyer said. &quot;We feel that it has come to the point where we must place pressure on the NGV via their biggest supporters - their VIPs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Cohen</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">846 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) issued a mixed decision in the &quot;Travel Ban&quot; litigation, relating to Presidential Executive Order 13780 (&quot;EO&quot;). As explained in more detail below, the SCOTUS decision gave a partial victory to the respondents who had challenged the EO while at the same time upholding the travel ban and related provisions for certain foreign nationals who cannot demonstrate a sufficient nexus to a family member, employer, educational institution or other entity in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court granted certiorari and consolidated the two federal court cases from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. It will hear arguments in the consolidated case in the Court's October, 2017 term.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are three sections of the EO that were in issue before the Supreme Court: (1) the section of the EO that sought to stay for 90 days the entry into the U.S. of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan Syria and Yemen; (2) the section of the EO that sought to suspend for 120 days decisions on applications for refugee status and travel of refugees into the U.S.; and (3) the section of the EO that sought to limit fiscal year 2017 refugee admissions to no more than 50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the Supreme Court ruled: SCOTUS granted a partial stay of the Circuit Court preliminary injunctions that had been issued against the above-referenced sections of the EO. The Supreme Court based its decision on a distinction between those foreign nationals seeking entry who have credible claims of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States, and those foreign nationals who are not able to establish that they have such relationships. For those individuals who can demonstrate the required relationship, it left the injunctions intact and neither the 90-day travel ban, nor the above-referenced refugee-related provisions will take effect. For those who are not able to prove the required relationship, the 90-day travel ban and the refugee-related provisions will remain in effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timing of the Implementation of the Travel Ban as to Those Who Cannot Demonstrate Sufficient Ties to the U.S.: Pursuant to a Memorandum issued by the White House on June 14th, the travel ban would take effect 72 hours after SCOTUS stayed the Circuit Courts' injunctions. In light of today's SCOTUS decision, based on the above-referenced memorandum, the revived travel ban and refugee ban will likely take effect on Thursday, June 29, 2017. If the ban becomes effective on June 29, 2017, then it would end 90 days later, on Wednesday, September 27, 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Practical Impact of SCOTUS Ruling: The result of today's decision is that for the duration of the forthcoming 90-day travel ban, it will be up to each impacted foreign national seeking (a) a visa to the U.S. and (b) admission into the U.S. at an international airport or U.S. border to prove that s/he has a credible claim of a pre-existing bona fide relationship to a family member or entity (such as an employer, educational institution, business association, hospital, etc.) in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unanswered Questions: Today's Supreme Court decision leaves many questions unanswered. It is not yet clear how much proof and documentation will be required to prove the required relationship and it is not yet clear how much authority the U.S. government will cede to the airlines in evaluating whether the relationships are sufficient. Similarly, it is not yet clear what guidance the Administration will provide to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers about their role in determining whether the required relationship has been sufficiently proved. For example, will the Administration instruct CBP that it should accept the issuance of a visa to an affected foreign national as sufficient proof of the required relationship or will the Administration instruct CBP to re-adjudicate this issue when the applicant for admission is seeking entry into the U.S.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Consular Officers will need to make judgments about impacted foreign nationals' relationships to parties in the United States, it seems likely that visa applications by impacted foreign nationals could be delayed, which could in turn delay other visa applications by non-impacted visa applicants. It is also possible that some impacted applicants for admission may be detained for additional questioning by CBP upon arrival in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the unusual nature of the Supreme Court's mixed decision, all eyes will be on the statements that will be made by the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Department of State, about the forthcoming implementation of today's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump has signed two executive orders to ban refugees from entering the US and to rebuild the military. One order begins the process, in his view, of building up the armed forces, while the other is designed to prohibit radical terrorists from entering the country, but acts as a temporary, blanket ban for any refugee coming to the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is big stuff,&quot; he said, signing the order in front of a raft of cameras. It is the first act to institute a threat he first gave in December 2015 shortly after the terrorist attacks in Paris, when he said all Muslims should be banned from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslims will be the biggest victim of the new executive order, which was reduced to only target immigrants from seven Muslim-dominated countries: Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. No new visas will be issued from these countries for 30 days. These countries are affected by conflict and terrorism, but anyone escaping persecution and death will be barred from refuge in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian refugees will be banned &quot;indefinitely&quot;, although an exemption in the order an remarks by Mr Trump indicate Christians from the country will still be allowed in. It already takes around two years for Syrian refugees to be vetted and enter the US. Refugees coming here are screened by the National CounterterrFBI, Defense and State depts, US Customs, and border protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[This is a] measure to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of America. We don't want them here,&quot; said Mr Trump. He warned that the US should never forget the attacks of 9/11 or those who lost their lives in the Pentagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want to admit the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those that support our country and love, deeply, our people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is yet to be defined how the President will carry out his proposal of &quot;extreme vetting&quot; and the &quot;religious test&quot; of incoming immigrants when the ban is lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep Michael McCaul, the Republican and Homeland Security chairman, told CNN that Christians from Syria would not pose a terrorist threat to the US compared to Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems to be they [Christians] would be top of the list,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President has been widely condemned for threatening to institute this order, which was seen as discriminatory. It was signed on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, a reminder that the US barred tens of thousands of Jews from a safe haven when more than six million of their people were being murdered by Nazis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then signed another executive order to rebuild the military, to build &quot;new planes, new ships, tools and resources&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, the US spent $598bn (&pound;450bn) on the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we prepare our budget request for Congress, our military strength will be questioned by no one and neither will our dedication to peace. And we do want peace,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The orders were signed while General James Mattis was being sworn in as defense secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to extend a very special congratulations to a great man and that's Secretary Mattis,&quot; he said. &quot;I think he's going to lead us so brilliantly. He's a tremendous solider, always has been. He's a general's general.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speed and scale of people fleeing Myanmar has triggered a humanitarian emergency in Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of refugees now depend on humanitarian assistance for shelter, food, water and other life-saving needs, says the United Nations migration agency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The seriousness of the situation cannot be over-emphasized,&quot; said International Organization for Migration (IOM) Bangladesh Chief of Mission Sarat Dash in a press statement.<BR><BR>According to the IOM-hosted Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) of aid agencies, an estimated 536,000 people have fled Myanmar and arrived in Cox's Bazar over the past 47 days. Numbers spiked again when some 15,000 more crossed into Bangladesh between 9-11 October.<BR><BR>Prior to the August influx, infrastructure and basic services in Cox's Bazar were already under strain as it hosted over 200,000 displaced Rohingya.<BR><BR>&quot;These people are malnourished and there is insufficient access to clean water and sanitation in many of the spontaneous sites. They are highly vulnerable. They have fled conflict, experienced severe trauma and are now living in extremely difficult conditions,&quot; underscored Mr. Dash.<BR><BR>With many of the new arrivals requiring immediate health assistance, agencies have appealed for $ 48 million to scale up primary health care in the new settlements over the next six months.<BR><BR>&quot;The risk of an outbreak of communicable disease is very high given the crowded living conditions and the lack of adequate clean water and sanitation,&quot; said IOM Senior Regional Health Officer Patrick Duigan, pointing out that maternal, newborn and child health care are also in desperately short supply.<BR><BR>While almost all new arrivals need non-food items, the spike in migrants is also overwhelming existing water, sanitation and hygiene facilities.<BR><BR>With the population in multiple sites and settlements more than doubling since 25 August, there is tremendous pressure on existing settlements, resulting in a huge site management need for some 700,000 people, costing an estimated $ 65 million, according to ISCG site management agencies.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his capacity as Chair of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine state, is in New York to brief a closed-door session of the Security Council on the situation. He is expected to speak to reporters after the meeting.<BR><BR>Collecting refugee data At the same time, the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been working with the Government in a new 'family counting' exercise to collect data on the estimated 536,000 newly-arrived refugees and their needs.<BR><BR>&quot;The exercise will enable the Government, UNHCR and other agencies to have a better understanding of the size and breakdown of the population and where they are located,&quot; UNHCR spokesperson Andrej Mahecic told reporters at today's regular press briefing in Geneva.<BR><BR>&quot;It is key for getting the right aid to the right people. It will also help flag refugees with special protection needs, such as single mothers with small infants, people with disabilities, or children and elderly refugees who are on their own,&quot; he added.<BR><BR>The exercise has so far counted 17,855 families - more than 70,000 individuals. It is currently being carried out in the Balukhali Extension and Kutupalong Extension camps and should cover an estimated 525,000 people over the coming weeks.<BR><BR>Mr. Mahecic said that UNHCR is working closely with refugee community leaders on presenting information to the new arrivals and providing equipment and the database.

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Prime Minister of Japan  raised the possibility of shooting down North Korean refugees who try to enter his country in the event of war.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taro Aso, who also serves as finance minister, made the remarks when discussing Japanese responses to war at a press conference in Utsunomiya, north of Tokyo. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He asked: 'Will police respond and arrest them on charges of illegal immigration? If Self-Defence Forces are dispatched, will they shoot them down?'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raising fears that some 100,000 North Korean refugees, some with guns, would try to enter Japan, the official added: 'It's a politician's job to think of an emergency response. It may not be an event in the distant future.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Korean foreign ministry criticised Friday's comments.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said in a statement: 'The government thinks it is very regretful in that a responsible government official of Japan recently made such a prejudiced remark with regard to North Korean refugees in a hypothetical situation that is based on a nationalistic perspective and it also runs counter to international norms related to refugee protection.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry also called for restraint from making remarks that could cause misunderstandings or have a negative impact on peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes amid claims that some 20,000 South Koreans would die every day in the event of a US- North Korean &nbsp;war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim was made by a retired Air Force general who said the figure was estimated based on a conventional war scenario and did not include potential use of nuclear weapons.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier today, &nbsp; South Korea and China  urged the United States to help dial down tensions with the North after Pyongyang accused President Donald Trump of declaring war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho made the shock claim that Trump had declared war on North Korea, a statement branded 'absurd' by the White House.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When playing out hypothetical war scenarios in case armed conflict were to break out, the Pentagon 'estimated the potential number of dead in South Korea at 20,000 each day', retired general Rob Givens told the LA Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Givens, who spent four years stationed in Korea, added that the figures did not take into account potential use of nuclear weapons by Pyongyang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There is only one way that this war ends. With North Korea's defeat - but at what cost?,' Givens said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry pleaded with both the US and Pyongyang to 'realise that resorting to military force will never be a viable way to resolve the peninsula issue and their own concerns, adding that 'War on the peninsula will have no winner.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While repeatedly calling for dialogue to resolve the issue, China has also signed up for increasingly tough UN sanctions against North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's fuel exports to North Korea fell in August, along with iron ore imports from the isolated nation, as trade slowed after the latest UN sanctions, but coal shipments resumed after a five-month hiatus, customs data showed on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Moscow, Russia's Foreign Ministry said it was working behind the scenes to find a political solution and that using sanctions against North Korea was almost exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis, speaking during a visit to India, said he appreciated global efforts to increase pressure on North Korea for its dangerous behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday in New York, Ri Yong-ho insisted all options are on the table for Pyongyang and that his nation now reserves the right to shoot down US planes even if they are not in Korea's air space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, talking to reporters in New York, said: 'The whole world should clearly remember it was the US who first declared war on our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ri added: 'Trump claimed our leadership would not be around much longer. He declared a war on our country.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks from the rogue state's Foreign Minister is in reaction to comments made by the President of the US in which he questioned how long the North Korean leadership would be in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump claimed our leadership would not be around much longer,' Ri said, threatening to shoot down American aircraft from international airspace.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The question of who will be around much longer will be answered then,' he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ri, who made the comments before leaving New York where he had attended last week's UN General Assembly, made the statement then returned from his car to the press microphones to add: 'In light of the declaration of war by Trump, all options will be on the operations table of the supreme leadership of the DPRK (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea).'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His words echoed warnings from the Trump administration that all options were on the table in dealing with North Korea's nuclear and missile development and its threats to have a weapon capable of reaching the continental United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday afternoon, the Pentagon gave reassurance to Trump to say he will be provided with options to deal with Pyongyang if North Korea does not stop with its 'provocative actions'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Ri told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with its rockets was inevitable after 'Mr Evil President' Trump called Pyongyang's leader a 'rocket man' on a suicide mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump tweeted: 'Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at UN.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea has pursued its missile and nuclear programs in defiance of international condemnation and sanctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on September 3 Pyongyang said on Friday it might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests, it has also called for the United States and its allies to help lessen tension by dialling back their military drills.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">653  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For decades a giant mural painted by a group of Chilean students and refugees had been forgotten about, hidden from view behind a wall in the foyer at Leeds University Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could have been lost forever had a Chilean PhD student not happened to catch a glimpse of it during a refurbishment earlier this year and recognised his country's national flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The student posted a picture online of the artwork, which turned out to be a mural painted in 1976 by Chilean exiles who had fled from General Pinochet's reign of tyranny in their homeland.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mural, copied from the kind of cultural poster often found on the streets of Chile prior to Pinochet's military coup, features miners and agricultural workers along with the slogan And There Will be Work For all' written in Spanish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, more than 40 years after it was first painted, the damaged mural is being restored with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was originally created in the Students' Union to help draw attention to the plight of the thousands of Chileans who suffered under Pinochet's rule in the aftermath of the coup that ousted the democratically elected Marxist leader, Salvadore Allende, in 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story of the Chilean students and refugees who painted the mural was covered at the time by our sister publication the Yorkshire Evening Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who worked on it was Gilberto Hernandez. He had been a journalist in Chile and spent two years in prison before being released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was allowed to leave the country with his young wife, but left behind his mother, sister and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of political refugees fled Chile during this period, with many arriving in the UK and in particular places like Sheffield and Leeds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hernandez was among those who came to Leeds, arriving here in the autumn of 1975. He said: &quot;There were over 200 Chilean people that came to Leeds and we were supported by organisations like the Chile Solidarity Campaign, which helped us find accommodation and families to stay with until we were settled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We went to the university for meetings and to use the cafe and we asked them if we could paint a mural and they said yes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hernandez studied at the university before working as a librarian at The Yorkshire Post for more than 20 years, but over time he and his Chilean friends forgot about the mural.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is why he is delighted that it has now been found' and is being restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes it is not only important to Chilean exiles living in the UK, but all those who have found themselves in a similar situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;It has a strong meaning to me because it denounces the crimes committed by the Pinochet dictatorship and still acts as a symbol of solidarity and friendship for the people who have been persecuted by dictators and continues to show hope for refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once restored, the mural will form the centrepiece of a resource library dedicated to refugees and asylum seekers, bringing members of the student, local and Chilean communities together. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union Affairs Officer Jack Palmer said: &quot;We hope that the mural's inspiring story will encourage new political artwork in Leeds and bring students, refugees, local residents and the Yorkshire Chilean community closer together.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restoration work will begin next month and is due to be completed by February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1973, Chile's president Salvador Allende, the world's first democratically-elected Marxist head of state, was overthrown and died in a military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet and backed by the CIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the subsequent dictatorship, more than 3,000 political opponents were killed, while thousands more were tortured or disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People were arrested for their political or trades union work, or simply for supporting the previous government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the refugees that fled to the UK ended up in Leeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30 refugees landed  in the city in November 1974, with the remainder arriving in October the following year. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A West African refugee jailed twice for sex attacks&nbsp;has won &pound;110,000 compensation after he was kept in prison too long after his home country refused to take him back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aliou Bah, 28, from Guinea, has twice been convicted and jailed for sex assaults, including one on a 16-year-old girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was kept in prison after serving his sentences whilst the Home Office battled in vain to deport him to his West African homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High Court Judge Nicholas Madge has now ruled that, after a series of Home Office blunders, Bah was kept in prison for 21 months longer than he should have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many would say that it is the victims of sexual abuse who should be paid large sums in compensation, not the men who sexually abuse them, the judge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He agreed wholeheartedly with that but, making the &pound;110,000 award, he added that, as a judge, it was his job to uphold the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Bah had refugee status, he should never have been held in custody after his sentences expired, the judge ruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, as the Guinea Embassy had refused to issue him with travel documents, there was never any prospect of deporting him anyway, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bah, who arrived in the UK in 2007 to join his refugee father, was convicted of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl in February 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was jailed for 18 months and put on the sex offenders' register for 10 years. But he was jailed again, for two years, for another sexual assault in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Secretary signed a deportation order against him in December 2011, without anyone realising that he was entitled to be treated as a refugee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he was held in prison for 14 months between January 2012 and March 2013, pending a deportation that could never have happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was held again, this time for seven months, between October 2014 and June 2015, again unlawfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given his refugee status and the attitude of the Guinea Embassy, there was no prospect of him being thrown out of the country, said the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guinea authorities have consistently refused to issue travel papers to anyone who does not want to return to the country voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bah had not volunteered to go home and the judge said that no-one had been successfully deported to the West African state since 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both periods of immigration detention were therefore necessarily unlawful, the judge ruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the award, the judge said there were few more important principles in a civilized society than that noone must be locked up without lawful authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bah was entitled to justice, like anyone else, and it was the role of independent judges to hold the government to account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had served his punishments for his crimes and was only due compensation because of the Home Office's failure to properly apply its own policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Madge concluded that, had Home Office officials behaved in a competent manner, the need to award Bah damages would not have arisen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh has stepped up security along its frontier with the state of West Bengal after claims Rohingya Muslim refugees are being steered into its territory by Indian border guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said on Sunday that in recent weeks hundreds of refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar have been pushed into Bangladesh at the western border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have stepped up surveillance and patrols so that no Rohingya can be pushed into our territory,' Lieutenant Colonel Hakim told news agency AFP.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tariqul Hakim, an area commander of the Border Guard Bangladesh, said Rohingya could be seen gathering opposite the Putkhali frontier post, where just a narrow river divides the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our directions are very clear, and that is to push all Rohingya into Bangladesh Indian border guard in West Bengal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 40,000 Rohingya in India but the Indian government wants them deported, telling a top court last month they pose a security threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hakim said Rohingya communities inside India could be trying to reunite with their families in southeast Bangladesh, where more than half a million Rohingya refugees have arrived since August from Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 536,000 refugees have crossed since August 25, fleeing violence in western Myanmar described by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Indian border guard in West Bengal told AFP that patrols had previously turned over all Rohingya intercepted at the frontier to local police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But now our directions are very clear, and that is to push all Rohingya into Bangladesh,' he told AFP on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are trying to accomplish our task with active local support'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bangladesh border guard official, Abdul Hossain, said villages along the frontier were on high alert, with newly-arrived refugees saying they had been encouraged by Indian guards to cross the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We've been patrolling the border day and night to prevent their entry. Local villagers have also joined us in the patrols,' Hossain told AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local council member Nazrul Islam said more than a dozen Rohingya who crossed at a southwestern part of the frontier Friday reported Indian guards opening a section of barbed wire to allow them to pass easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh already hosts at least 800,000 Rohingya, including those who fled earlier crackdowns in Myanmar, and does not want to accept any from India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is trying to repatriate the Rohingya to Myanmar. But the stateless Muslim minority are reviled in the mainly Buddhist nation and considered to be illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unprecedented influx of refugees has put immense pressure on Bangladeshi authorities and charities, who have described the crisis as one of the world's most pressing humanitarian emergencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya refugees fleeing violence in Burma have told how the military targeted children and the elderly in sickening attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslim minority refugees said soldiers and Buddhist leaders carried out a systematic campaign of murder and burning villages - accusations which military leaders have denied.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shawkat Ara, 38, said soldiers attacked her village in the middle of the night and she hid in the jungle with fellow villagers as they watched their houses burn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: ``The military told the young boys to stand in a line and told them to run. When they were running they rushed them from behind and they were falling in ditches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Some were cut into pieces and thrown into ditches. They were all between 10 and 12 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The military were actually playing with the boys. They were telling them to run and then cutting them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: ``I broke my hand crawling into the jungle. When the soldiers started firing, people were running here and there, it was totally messed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Fathers were not staying with their sons and sons were not looking for their fathers, just running for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The small children were the worst affected because they can't run.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a recent agreement with the Burmese government for repatriation, refugees continue to arrive in Bangladesh, joining 646,000 who have braved the dangerous border crossing since the surge in violence after Rohingya militants reportedly attacked border posts in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alistair Dutton, director of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (Sciaf), which has raised more than &pound;160,000 to help the refugees, said: ''I don't know who's guilty of what but what has happened are crimes against humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The chopping people up, shooting them, burning bodies, torching villages, stealing belongings and driving people out their country - these are crimes against humanity whoever perpetrated them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Dutton warned the crisis could last for years, stressing that Sciaf and charity partner Caritas Bangladesh were planning for the long term as the average time a person spends as a refugee is 17 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Ara, who saw her parents and one son die from hunger as she made the arduous journey to safety in Bangladesh, said she also witnessed soldiers attacking the elderly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said her neighbour, an elderly imam, was shot and attacked with machetes before being burned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kamal Hossain, 41, one of the Rohingya refugees who met the Pope on his recent visit to Burma and Bangladesh, said 80% of 9,675 people were killed in the district where he was leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: ``The military applied their tricks - they were killing the elderly and young people first so that the other people would do nothing to them. They apply these techniques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Most people were burned and killed in fires set by the military. After the killing they threw the bodies into the ditches so people can't take the water because it is full of blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The villagers had no food, so that made them flee.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the military forced him to watch as they raped his daughter-in-law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People can donate to Sciaf's Rohingya emergency appeal at www.sciaf.org.uk or call 0141 354 5555.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greek government said yesterday that it could not accept a German decision to start sending back asylum seekers who had passed through its borders because it was overwhelmed by the tens of thousands already on its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement, from a senior migration official, suggests that there will be tension between Athens and Berlin before German elections next month. The far-right Alternative for Germany party is trying to revive migration as a political issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be tragic if not hugely nonsensical for Greece to take back refugees from Germany and other European countries as it battles to manage 60,000 refugees and migrants already stranded here,&quot; the Greek official said. &quot;It's not an issue of Greece not wanting, rather of it not being able, to take back refugees because it simply does not have the space.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Accommodation facilities are already up to the brim with refugees. They are at breaking point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking on condition of anonymity because of his closeness to talks with the EU on the migrant returns, which are expected to begin next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paris yesterday Angela Merkel joined a French-led attempt to manage the flow of migrants from Africa through action against people smugglers along the migrant routes and aid to help to improve conditions there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders of Chad, Niger and Libya, all transit countries for migrants, were at a meeting in the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace along with President Macron, Paolo Gentiloni, the Italian prime minister, and Mariano Rajoy, his Spanish counterpart. Mr Macron and the African leaders agreed on a system for filtering Europe-bound migrants in their home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Macron said that Niger and Chad had agreed to help to establish the identity of potential asylum seekers before they left their territory. France and other states would accept asylum applications and handle them on the spot, Mr Macron said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the so-called Dublin rules EU states are required to return asylum seekers to their country of entry to the 28-nation bloc. Germany and other states suspended the returns in 2011 after the European Court of Human Rights questioned Greece's ability to take back migrants because of its economic crisis, harsh conditions and poor treatment of refugees by local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greek official said that Berlin and Athens were in continuous contact about the plan but Greece was not prepared to accept more than 50 asylum seekers in special shelters in the capital and in the historic city of Thebes. &quot;It will just be a symbolic gesture,&quot; the&nbsp;official said. &quot;We want to show that Greece is upholding its side of its commitments in this migration crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks echo the government's call for a revision of the Dublin regulations. They also mark a fresh jab at Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to take in thousands of migrants and refugees in line with an agreement to help to ease an unprecedented build-up of asylum seekers in Greece and Italy. Fewer than 20,000 of an estimated 160,000 relocations have been completed since the agreement was reached two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's executive branch has launched infringement procedures against the three states, giving them until the end of the month to reconsider their refusal to resettle even a single refugee as part of the EU-wide scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month Ioannis Mouzalas, the Greek migration minister, told the German public service broadcaster ARD that Berlin's demand for the refugee returns was part of Mrs Merkel's election strategy. &quot;There was pressure from several EU countries to resume returns,&quot; Mr Mouzalas said. &quot;I understand that governments want to show some results to their voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French-led initiative is aimed at staunching the flow across the Mediterranean through a combination of incentives to remain in Africa and action against the traffickers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about his &quot;dream&quot; of making the short sea crossing from Morocco to Spain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;. The phrase needs little translation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other diners leap out of their cracked plastic chairs to push the man back, and the bizarre incident is over as quickly as it began. But it is a sudden reminder of the strain that is created when a small city -Tangier has a population of fewer than a million -finds itself at the centre of Europe's migration crisis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adorning the walls of the restaurant are printouts of grainy selfies showing anxious yet clearly overjoyed young men being lifted out of their panteras, adrift in the Mediterranean, into larger vessels run by charities such as the Spanish Red Cross, the Cruz Roja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher, the Sierra Leonean, explains that when the migrants are picked up on the crossing the first thing they do is send a photo back to friends waiting in Morocco to show that, despite everything, they have finally made it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher's parents were among the 300,000 civilians killed in Sierra Leone's civil war between 1991 and 2002 and he himself was forced to fight in the conflict as a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has lived in Tangier for three years after an arduous journey via Guinea, Mali, across the Sahara Desert and Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is very little for us to celebrate here so when our brothers make it, it is as if every one of us has made it,&quot; he says. Pointing to the walls, he laughs: &quot;We all dream of making it onto the Hall of Fame.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Morocco to Spain migrant route has exploded in popularity in 2017, with over 15,000 people so far rescued in the Strait of Gibraltar, marking a 338 per centincrease on last year alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first reason for this is the perceived security situation in nearby Libya, once a major trafficking hub. Much of the country is now run by lawless militias, resulting in many migrants reaching their final departure destination only to be sold into slavery or forced into sex work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This phenomenon made headlines when it was captured in images and videos by Reuters and CNN in November, news which reaches not just the West but also those back down the people-smuggling routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrants dream of leaving Tangier's Old Town (pictured) and making the crossing to southern Spain (Joe Wallen)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, the effectiveness of the Libyan coastguard in stopping boats from leaving has improved dramatically, ever since an agreement was signed in February that saw Italy provide money, training and equipment to the beleaguered Libyan fleet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so migrants are now increasingly making for Morocco, and Tangier in particular, where just 14 miles of sea separate them from the Spanish town of Tarifa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd rather die in that sea than stay here or go home,&quot; says his housemate Habas, 34, who is from neighbouring Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Habas is on crutches with a broken leg, the result of falling off the border wall in an attempt to get into the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. He has also made four unsuccessful attempts to cross to Spain via boat. Despite his latest injury, he says he is as determined as ever to reach Spain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of thousands more people have crossed by boat and on foot into Bangladesh in the last 24 hours as they flee violence in western Burma, the UNHCR said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burma 's security officials and insurgents from the Rohingya ethnic minority are accusing each other of burning down villages and committing atrocities in Burma 's Rakhine state. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military has said nearly 400 people, most of them insurgents, have died in armed clashes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence has triggered a flood of refugees crossing mostly on foot into Bangladesh, though some were fleeing in wooden boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Roughly 60,000 have arrived in Bangladesh since the violence erupted on August 25,&quot; said UN Refugee Agency spokeswoman Vivian Tan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is about 20,000 more than the number local officials had estimated on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees who had arrived at the Bangladeshi fishing village of Shah Porir Dwip described bombs exploding and Rohingyas being burned alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We fled to Bangladesh to save our lives,&quot; said a man who only gave his first name, Karim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The military and extremist Rakhine are burning us, burning us, killing us, setting our village on fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he paid 12,000 Bangladeshi taka, or about &pound;116, for each of his family members to be smuggled on a wooden boat to Bangladesh after soldiers killed 110 Rohingya in their village of Kunnapara, near the coastal town of Maungdaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The military destroyed everything. After killing some Rohingya, the military burned their houses and shops,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a baby who is eight days only, and an old woman who is 105.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Satellite imagery analysed by Human Rights Watch shows hundreds of buildings had been destroyed in at least 17 sites across Rakhine state since August 25, including some 700 structures that appeared to have been burned down in just the village of Chein Khar Li, the international rights watchdog said in a statement Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali Hossain, a deputy commissioner in Cox's Bazar, said Bangladesh was struggling to cope as &quot;the flow of Rohingya refugees is continuing by boat and the land route.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Red Cross has sent teams to refugee camps, in co-ordination with the local Red Crescent Society, to &quot;assess the refugees' requirements. The influx is scattered at different places. The task is challenging for us&quot;, said spokeswoman Misada Saif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violence erupted when insurgents attacked Burma police and paramilitary posts in what they said was an effort to protect minority Rohingya. In response, the military unleashed what it called &quot;clearance operations&quot; to root out the insurgents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates for the Rohingya, an oppressed Muslim minority in overwhelmingly Buddhist Burma, say security forces and vigilantes both have attacked and burned villages, shooting civilians and causing others to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government blames the insurgents for burning their own homes and killing Buddhists in Rakhine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Longstanding tension between the Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists erupted in bloody rioting in 2012, forcing more than 100,000 Rohingya into displacement camps, where many still live.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article that discusses immigration without mentioning refugees does not add much to the debate (&quot;It's not racist to have fears over immigration&quot;, David Quinn, Comment, last week).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I like to think that Angela Merkel's welcome for refugees was informed by her knowledge of her country's history in creating millions of them in the middle of the last century. My welcome for her efforts was due to the rigidly uncompromising attitude Ireland adopted to the resettlement of persecuted Jewish refugees in the war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course we need to distinguish economic migrants from those fleeing great danger. Of course we cannot have totally open borders. The EU, on whose behalf we police part of the western frontier, also knows that. However, if Germany and other EU states can show compassion for refugees coming from outside the EU, then I support their efforts. Seamus McKenna, Dublin 14 The secret is out There is a secrecy and slyness about government policy regarding immigration. We are seeing the effect of a huge increase in population on a country which isn't set up to deal with it. The huge pressure on housing inevitably leads to a spike in prices. As people's wages haven't risen commensurately, they have to set aside an enormous portion of what they earn to have a roof over their head. Mark O'Higgins, Dublin 8 Identity crisis Quinn articulated the concerns privately held by people in almost the same manner as that expressed by our neighbours at the Brexit ballot box. Most people have a problem with uncontrolled open-door immigration. This has nothing to do with racism but with a desire for identity, belonging, a sense of history, culture and common mindset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU must revisit immigration and free movement if the rise of the far right and copycat exiteering is to be avoided. Edmond O'Sullivan, Midleton, Co Cork Feeling the strain Quinn says he always deals in facts then talks about the &quot;evident strain that is being placed on our infrastructure by mass immigration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry, no, there is no such strain caused by &quot;mass immigration&quot;. It is due to massive economic growth, along with a refusal to tax any but a small proportion of those at the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are a low-tax, highspend country, which uses the value added by highly skilled immigrants as a cash cow, and directs all tax raising at these people. Stephen Barrett, Dublin Dark age While couched in seemingly temperate and logical rhetoric, Quinn's piece has a dark underbelly - scaremongering and blaming. He patronisingly tells us that &quot;the average person doesn't have the basic facts and figures&quot; in relation to immigration and then uses random numbers from the ESRI and the CSO to further a specious argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quinn even mentions that he is married to a non-EU migrant, as if that gives him the moral platform to blame immigration for our housing and infrastructure problems. That's like Donald Trump saying he likes Mexicans but is still going to build a wall to keep them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blaming the small number of immigrants here from impoverished areas and war zones for causing our housing problems and strains on our infrastructure has too many echoes of our shameful 1930s Blueshirt movement. We do not have an extreme ultraright wing nationalist party and I would like to keep it that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerard McKeown Marino, Dublin 3 Out of control The figures cited raise the possibility that immigrants could outnumber Irish-born people by mid-century. And because we have ceded control over EU migration to our masters in Brussels, there is little we can do about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Garvey Killester, Dublin 5 Rescue party You mention that Ireland does not have an antiimmigration party. More's the pity. As someone who increasingly feels like a stranger here, I would gladly vote for such a party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teenager Malak arrived in Jordan from Syria two years ago, just another victim of the world's worst refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting the needs of refugee children is challenging enough. The charity Mercy Corps estimates 40,000 Syrian children face barriers to accessing education.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for 15-year-old Malak, who was born with dwarfism and severe scoliosis, the obstacles are even greater. Not much more than two feet tall, it is only thanks to Mercy Corps that she is able to get the education that will help her pursue her goal of one day returning to Syria to teach others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is supported with regular classes and occupational therapy by Haleema, also a refugee who, before leaving Syria, educated orphans in her own home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mercy Corps trained Haleema to provide physical, occupational and speech therapy, and academic training so that she can support students like Malak. An equipment repair workshop, set up in the Zaatari refugee camp, customises kit for students with disabilities, while employing Syrians in a cash-for-work repair scheme. Here, the charity customised a chair for Malak so she was able to sit comfortably in class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope that we can return back to Syria and the war is over and there will be peace all around Syria,&quot; Malak says. &quot;But if the war will not be over and it will not be safe, I'm hoping I can travel outside the country and learn a new language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mercy Corps is The Herald's Christmas Charity and by donating to our appeal you can support its life-changing work. More than seven years of conflict have forced more than 11 million people - half of Syria's entire pre-war population - to flee their homes. Around 10 per cent of those forced from the country have a disability and if services for disabled students in Jordan were limited before the war; now they are almost non-existent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mercy Corps Inclusive Education programme seeks to improve access to education for all students. This year it helped more than 8,000 children with disabilities access formal education in Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees with skills like carpentry or blacksmithing are employed in the workshop. They repair and customise wheelchairs and desks and repair hearing aids and eyeglasses. This benefits children such as 13-year-old Ahmad, who used to stay home and not go to school. Now, with a personalised wheelchair, Ahmad enjoys going to school. He wants to become a mobile phone technician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mercy Corps often works with young people, regarding them as not just a source of hope and determination, but as change-makers who can help communities find a way through crisis, from relief towards recovery and ultimately resilience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 83 per cent of refugees lack documentation, making it impossible to even register children for school. Last year Mercy Corps supported registration for 26,500 refugees in Jordan, with the result that the number of children out of primary school dropped by half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can ensure such work continues. Please consider donating to the Herald's Christmas Charity Appeal on behalf of the work of Mercy Corps in Syria, Jordan and many other crisis hit areas of the world. See below for details of how to get involved.</SPAN></P>

This was the birth of Orenda, an organization that designs virtual curricula, including video and game-based translations of government curricula, and monitors its performance using mobile internet.<BR><BR>After piloting with 1,300 students over the past two years, participating schools have seen substantial improvements in performance and reductions in drop-out rates. His ambitions for Orenda are as strong as ever, and his vision for the next 2-5 years is it becoming truly national by serving children all over Pakistan.<BR><BR>Pakistan's education system is at capacity, Haroon says, and he sees mobile phones and internet as perfect tools to alleviate this. For Haroon, ensuring youth access to education is essential. He says that peace is disturbed when people don't have their basic needs met. Begin to meet their basic needs, and you build peace.<BR><BR>Coming from Pattani, a war-torn corner of Thailand's south, Asma says she's always had what matters - an education, the will to improve herself and the opportunities to follow her dreams. That's all you need, she says, in order to give back to your community.<BR><BR>Asma does this through WO-MANIS, an organization she founded which helps women in the conflict zones of southern Thailand who have lost their husbands and families. WO-MANIS helps women build sustainable sources of income by training them and providing them with an online platform to sell their handicrafts.<BR><BR>The internet and, by extension, Thailand's social media scene helps Asma's organization promote and connect women's strengths with far-reaching marketplaces. Tech helps connect people, she says, and that connection is the first step you need in building peace and improving lives.<BR><BR>Her passions are what saw her awarded a ticket to the Nobel Peace Prize ceremonies in Oslo two years ago as part of the Telenor Youth Forum Thailand delegation. When people think of her organization, she wants them to picture beautiful, smart and inspiring women, role model moms, sisters and daughters, all working together to make their community a happier, more peaceful place. To Asma, one's actions in life are based on opening opportunities and building communities, and she wants the world's youth to see through similar lenses.<BR><BR>A food efficiency advocate and professional pharmacist, Yong Wei Shian sees how inefficient the food supply and healthcare systems can be. While technology and innovation have enabled other industries like commerce, banking etc to focus more on efficiency and customer experiences, he says healthcare has been left behind. He wants to change that.<BR><BR>He's already won Digi's Challenge for Change program in Malaysia for building FoodNinja, an award-winning system that allowed excess food supplies to be distributed to charities, (Wei Shian was just 22 at the time). And now, this former Telenor Youth Forum delegate from Kuala Lumpur is moving on to develop a healthcare platform that will personalize preventative health solutions at an individual level - empowering all to live healthier lives.<BR><BR>He's discovered a passion for using technology and Big Data to maximize healthcare professionals' capacities, optimizing patient care and making his community a healthier place.<BR><BR>This International Youth Day, he says that youth need to discard inherited prejudices from older generations, go out into the world and start making connections. Technology allows us to do this. With technology, we can build on cultural exchanges and shared understanding of each other, which Wei Shian says, are the keys to peace.<BR><BR>Sharad Sagar is on a mission. This mission began nearly 10 years ago, when Sharad was only 16 years of age. He witnessed a gap in his country, a gap in terms of access to education, opportunities and resources. So he set out to do something about it.<BR><BR>Today Sharad Sagar is a leader in every sense of the word. He's been recognized by esteemed institutions such as the Rockefeller Foundation, Forbes and the United Nations as a major force for social entrepreneurship and impact.<BR><BR>His goal is simple: democratize education and create opportunities for the kids of Southeast Asia. By building up this generation and giving them access to the world, Sharad believes that he will create a generation capable of tackling 21st century challenges.<BR><BR>Technology plays a key role in Sharad's mission. It is the platform on which he is empowering future leaders and connecting them with people and information, no matter how remotely they live. By educating millions of children across Asia, he is encouraging greater cultural understanding, a key ingredient in a more peaceful world.<BR><BR>Without education, you don't have understanding. And without understanding, it's nearly impossible to achieve peace. Sharad Sagar's mission has taken him all over the world, but the heart of it remains in Southeast Asia. With every year that passes, Sharad's impact is felt by millions of children in India and beyond.<BR><BR>Technology has been a constant source of excitement and passion for Fatima, who was hooked from the moment she first saw her father using a computer. Today she's still blown away by the applications and opportunities that technology presents us all. A computer science major, she went on to become the first woman in her extended family to own a business.<BR><BR>She founded TechJuice, which is now Pakistan's leading media platform for startups and entrepreneurs. TechJuice's content reaches over 10 million people per month - in Pakistan alone, and is now playing a big role in the country's tech scene. Fatima pitched the platform at Telenor Youth Forum 2015, from which her learnings have helped her grow TechJuice's revenue, readership and reach.<BR><BR>Though Fatima admits that she eats, sleeps and drinks TechJuice, she's also an advocate for breaking down barriers of any kind and for giving people a voice. Though technology is fast-paced, lucrative and exciting, Fatima also sees it as a tool that can add to the peace process across the world, when leveraged properly. Technology levels the playing field for all, regardless of their races, genders, nationalities or religions, she says, and access to it can help the voiceless be heard.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells area Refugee Action Group would like to thank everyone who made their first fundraising gig such a success: the great musicians and singers;  Michael Eavis for his warm welcome and impassioned call to action over the refugee crisis in Europe; the management of the Red Brick Building and to all our supporters. &pound;1,586 was raised for the charity SAFE PASSAGE which works to provide safe and legal routes to sanctuary in the UK for unaccompanied child refugees and vulnerable adults. To date, 1150 refugee children have arrived in the UK through the routes Safe Passage have opened. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many are reunited with close family here. If you want to learn more of the charity's work please look at their website: safepassage.org.uk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regards to both Gill Tucker's and Michael Houser's letters to the journal, I would like to outline my experience. Three months ago I made an appointment at the Wells Health Centre only to have a text reminder sent both 1 week and 24 Hours before the apt was due even though I have never signed up for such a reminder ( which apparently you have to do) on notification of this they agreed to cancel this service, the next time I made an apt this happened again and again they agreed to stop it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Third time when the same thing happened I was informed that I had to opt out in writing from a service that I never opted into!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which I did, only to receive a text an hour later telling me that this had been successful, with a further text an hour after that asking me to complete a short survey regarding my recent experience with the NHS and there text reminder service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was subsequently informed that this service is automatic for everyone, WHY? Surely the NHS should target those people who miss their apts and not people like me who have never missed one or at least cancelled it!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One size does not fit all and the NHS should deal with people individually and not collectively, furthermore I would appreciate being consulted before being signed up to something I do not want nor need, irrespective of however many apts other people do not keep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the NHS keep their house in order is their affair but not at my expense!   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am writing in  response to your article in the 20th July 2017 edition of your newspaper about road safety in the area surrounding the schools in Brooks Road in particular. I noted with interest that the content of that email was published in the 27th July '17 edition of your newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same 27th July '17 edition I read an article under the subject heading and was confused and somewhat concerned about what I read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article noted parents interest and concern on this subject through social media but that none turned up to a Street Parish Council meeting on July 18th '17 to voice their concerns during the 15 minute Public Question Time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article indicated that the Public Question Time stretched to almost an hour to discuss road safety focusing on the Brooks Road situation in particular. Was it intended that this serious matter be raised at the Council's 18th July '17 meeting as either an agenda item or under Public Question Time? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it was the intention or not I would have thought that the Council would have announced in your 13th July '17 newspaper edition that either an agenda item or Public Question Time would be devoted to this subject at the 18th July '17 meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was my experience in 'another' county that if a local council wanted direct verbal input on a serious subject at a council meeting, usually the local media were engaged to publicise the fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the solutions to this serious road safety situation reportedly offered by councillors are only papering over cracks that have been known for some time, time that could have been spent implementing more robust solutions - if the will is there it does not take long to implement such robust solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are about to start on Monday our two week summer school (Tri.art) where over two weeks we will pull togerther a full scale production of Les Mis&Atilde;&copy;rables - our biggest show to date!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winner of over 100 international awards and seen by over 65 million people worldwide, Les Mis&Atilde;&copy;rables is an epic and uplifting story about the survival of the human spirit, and now you can see it at the Merlin Theatre performed by Tri.art Theatre school students. This special schools adaptation features one of the most memorable scores of all time and some of the most memorable characters to ever grace your stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In nineteenth century France, Jean Valjean is released from years of unjust imprisonment, but finds nothing in store for him but mistrust and mistreatment. He breaks his parole in hopes of starting a new life, initiating a lifelong struggle for redemption as he is relentlessly pursued by police inspector Javert, who refuses to believe Valjean can change his ways. Finally, during the Paris student uprising of 1832, Javert must confront his ideals after Valjean spares his life and saves that of the student revolutionary who has captured the heart of Valjean's adopted daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tri.art has gained a reputation for producing high quality youth productions; previous award winning shows include West Side Story and Oliver. Last year's production of Bugsy was so popular  that this year an extra show has been added. With over 40 students taking part in this classic musical this is going to be Tri.art's most ambitious production to date. Tickets cost 10.50 and  7.50. The show is on 23-26 August 7pm. Tickets can be bought on line: merlintheatre.co.uk or call the Box Office 01373 465949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The show is on 23-26 August so hopefully you will be able to come and see this wonderful showcase of local acting, singing and performing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Stag was taken from Glastonbury, which it had never previously left, without any prior discussion with the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society, its owners, or notification afterwards. It had not been GAS's intension to criticise the Abbey in public over its part in the removal but, as Ms Bell's letter ('Statue mystery? What mystery?!' 3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August) makes clear, there are sensitivities there and some surprising misunderstandings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack was loaned to the Abbey for display in 1996 not by the Somerset County Museums Service (the South West Heritage Trust not then</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">existing) but by and on the initiative of the GAS. The Museums Service were simply agents for the removal. The technical experts of the SWHT (one of the new breed of so-called 'Arms Length Organisations') have inherited a curatorial oversight of the GAS collection at the Tribunal museum (where Jack previously was) from the former Museums Service, although without any formal agreement. The SWHT is in no way entitled to remove objects without permission. Therefore there is no question of Jack being 'returned to the SWHT', as Ms Bell's letter states. It was never theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since my article appeared on 20 July, it has been verbally confirmed by Steve Minnitt of SWHT that Jack is 'in store in Taunton'. He reportedly thought the matter unimportant. The GAS has written to the SWHT requiring the return of Jack, with apology, by the end of the month, and a review of curatorial arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Abbey may have acted in part from a careless reading of its own documentation (copies of which GAS has), dating from 20 years ago when its governance was very different, by no stretch of the English language can it be said to have acted properly in the matter. In evicting Jack, an important historic heirloom of the town of Glastonbury (a decision it has not so far explained) the Abbey should clearly have consulted more widely concerning its future. Its failure to do so demonstrates insensitivity, arrogance and an ignorance of local history. It should certainly have informed Jack's owners of its intentions and ascertained their wishes. Through their lack of consultation, the Abbey and the SWHT have both clearly treated the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society (founded in 1886) - and, I would suggest, the town of Glastonbury - with something approaching a contempt which only seems compounded by the tone of Ms Bell's letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is quite a leap from reporting public support for farm subsidies, to the future being the large farm (your article &quot;Public want farm support to continue&quot; of 10th August 2017).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public consistently opposes megafarm planning applications, and large farms are popularly associated with hedgerow loss, monocultural landscapes, enormous machinery damaging topsoil and chemical treatment runoff polluting waterways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I doubt the public would support 80% of payments continuing to go to the 20% largest farm businesses, particularly when there is so little transparency in rural ownership, often unregistered land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WTO and CAP rules support larger farms, fuelling land prices, concentrating ownership into fewer hands, industrialising the countryside, and directing investment into production techniques and resources suitable for super-farms. In a greener world, reform is necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A serious political result is that the public have lost real connection to farming, and opinion often militates against farmers. If the Conservatives take us out of the European Customs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union, farmers will need all the public support they can get to face unfettered world competition. Labour campaigned to reconfigure funds for farming to support smaller traders, local economies, community benefits and sustainable practices. The CAP ignores tiny smallholdings, which deserve their fair share of financial support. Reversing this could revive market gardening and fruit farming, rectifying our current deficit in UK horticultural supply and consumption. Machinery, technology and know-how suppliers might follow this money. Public funds should benefit those whose main or principal income is from land they personally farm. Our county estate farms lower barriers to entry for new and young farmers, encourage innovation in an ageing industry, and keep farming local. In contrast, Conservative Herefordshire council recently decided to sell its small-holdings estate to gain &quot;value for money for taxpayers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells Labour seeks farming support for Labour policies. The Conservatives' Brexit referendum has shattered their government. Farmers may soon have to reconsider which party of government really supports an acceptable future for farming in our constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lawrence Centre took part in the last SOUP event on the 8th July.  We were fortunate to be the winner this time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claire Chettoe gave an inspiring presentation on behalf The Lawrence Centre.  She had four minutes to give a brief overview of the work we do at The Lawrence Centre which is mainly around supporting frail and vulnerable older people and provide interesting and stimulating activities as well as a freshly cooked lunch five days a week.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were delighted to have had the opportunity to take part and raise awareness of our service.  SOUP is a great occasion which helps to bring together local community and voluntary groups as well as the public.  It is a fantastic opportunity to support local projects that will benefit the community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We look forward to the next SOUP lunch on 14th October where we will be reporting how the &pound;325 we were awarded has been spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glastonbury has one of the most fluid and colorful histories of a town of its size in the world. Beginning as a settlement for ceremonial burial for the oldest prehistoric settlement ever discovered in the UK, near Godney, with its preserved artifacts examples of some of the best preserved wooden structures world wide, later on boundaries demarcating one of the furthest east Celtic boundaries, the presence of the 'Island' as a Pagan burial ground, then the first Christian Church developing into the richest Monastery in the UK. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also with it's numerous myths and legends, Games of Thrones-esque alter massacres (when monks in the Abbey 's main altar were slaughtered for refusing to sing Norman versions of hymns, a story which read a bit like the Red Wedding in George RR Martin's popular series!),  satire for Monty Python films regarding the Holy Grail, references to this important cultural centre in Tolkein's work (thinking of Rohan and Helms Deep clearly looking a lot like Glastonbury and Cheddar Gorge?), becoming a center for modern new age travellers, still bringing untold riches to the area, processions and healing centers for Buhddists, Hare Krishna's, Chrisitians and Feminists? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In modern times, kindly bringing the best music known to man to our doorstep. What we have here, is a place of importance to a great many people, and a lot of money for local business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, a few young squatters occupied the Red Brick Building, seeing that industrial architecture as an equally important part of the town's identity. Why have faceless clone companies take over the Moorlands site, when there's plenty of culture here to attract the money anyway, local businesses that benefit local people? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Red Brick Building is now a thriving business and community center. That's an example lot of what occupation politics are about, they are also about housing issues and the ways in which the travelling communities are deprived of land and choose to find alternative ways to live that seem abstract to those people lucky enough to own a house or prefer a mainstream lifestyle, but it's less natural to live in a box an stare out suspiciously at 'outsiders'. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the hermit caveman would behave like that, but humans generally prefer community and social relations. Some people live this way through choice, others because the housing crisis forces them to for survival. Stigma for travellers makes getting work harder, the whole thing is a long standing persecution of a way of life like any other right wing bigotry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation at Moorlands is actually less damaging to the environment than living in a house, there are a lot of things to learn from people there regarding sustainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the presence of Glastonbury as a centre for pilgrimage, it seems absolutely appropriate for a community of travellers to be given a safe place to stay. Having lived here for a few months this year, visiting yearly throughout my twenties and having grown up here, I've noticed that at the present time, there is a large housing problem, but it's a peaceful place to live at the moment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hasn't always been like that, and I can tell you from experience that the majority of violence and anti social behaviour in Glastonbury has come from people who are not travellers. Seeing the terrible way those at Dale Farm were treated in 2010, seeing housing tragedies in London tower blocks this year, why can't Mendip Discrict Council set a better example for the county? By taking over this land as a permanent and secure home for the travelling community, adding to the diversity of a very interesing town. Mendip District Council can tell the right wing bigots who are prejudiced, where to go i.e their home to watch Benefits Street and voice ugly opinions on message boards about issues they have no real world experience of. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mendip District Council should not go against the prevailing winds of the country. In Bristol grassroots campaigning is finally breaking this strange Thatcherite property obsession that convinced people that gaining a house was the ultimate goal and those who didn't achieve home ownership had failed in life, instead all sorts of people are in a constant dispute with a bullying and greedy landlord class, that bought up all the ex council houses and make a packet out of peoples right to shelter. You need an average of &pound;35,655 across the South West to gain a deposit on a house, (also how hard it is to even be approved for a mortgage to a society ridden with &pound;1.345 trillion in personal debt.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's absolutely impossible for people to get into secure accommodation under the sorts of housing policies that have been in place since the 1980s, in fact it created more decision and inequality, it created the need for alternative living solutions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those people insulting this community should at the very least be suggesting the council find an alternative site before any eviction attempt. Any attempts should be resisted by the compassionate people in the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ihave always felt grief for the unfortunate circumstances of the Syrian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many refugees have reached Europe, many reside in refugee camps in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I watched these scenes from the comfort of my living room, I felt compelled as a doctor and a human being to help in whatever way possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of my medical colleagues, Vhaid Mushtaq, had travelled previously to Adana in southern Turkey. On learning there would be another humanitarian aid mission in July, I jumped at the chance to get involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I travelled with a non-profit organisation called United Aid Network (UAN). Our group consisted of five doctors and seven non-medical humanitarian workers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We worked with a local charity that also consisted of Syrian refugees and visited three different camps in July 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had all fundraised prior to travelling, and between us raised &pound;15,000. This money went toward food parcels, medical supplies, sanitation projects and school equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we finally arrived at the first camp in Tuzla, I was overcome with a feeling of sorrow at what laid before me. I had seen such pictures before on television, but seeing it for myself made them very real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were flimsy tents spread over the sand unsystematically to accommodate 1,000 families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was limited electricity in several tents. The temperature was almost touching 40 degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had struggled all day in the uncomfortable heat, despite the air conditioning, however these residents did not enjoy such luxuries. Women and children worked the fields in the sweltering heat to support their families. The toilets consisted of a small tent with a hole in the ground flanked by two sandbags, with waste collecting on the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were flies collecting on the other side and these flies were also in contact with people's food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Needless to say, the potential for disease was evident. Several taps provided filtered water, which had been installed previously through UAN donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also a makeshift mosque and school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey hosts more than 2.9 million registered Syrians, with around 260,000 accommodated in government-run camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These camps are well funded and managed. However, there are many refugees living in unregistered camps that do not receive any funding and rely on humanitarian aid. It was for this reason that we visited unregistered refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrian people are some of the most welcoming and hospitable people I have met. Given their unfortunate circumstances, they insisted we have tea on each visit and prepared large meals for us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This presented a dilemma as I could only guess how many days' worth of food they had selflessly prepared, but at the same time it is seen as disrespectful to refuse food when offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We ran basic clinics at the camps which was best described by one of my colleagues as &quot;organised chaos&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had brought our own medical supplies with us consisting of analgesia, calpol, antibiotics, dressings and topical treatments; the majority of which was donated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medications that we did not have were acquired from pharmacies and given to patients in the camp the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We performed clinics in tents in each of the camps, in groups of two, in addition to a translator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people do not see a doctor unless their condition is life-threatening, soon hearing that there were doctors in the camp a queue of people formed outside the tent, which very quickly became a swarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy was limited. We worked alongside each other, although there was a separate tent for women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We saw many children with viral fevers or skin rashes. Diarrhoea was a common theme throughout the camps, especially with infants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people in the camp were afflicted with skin conditions such as fungal infections, scabies and wound infections following sunburn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other conditions we encountered were simple infections, heat rash, psoriasis, headaches and thermal injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without bloods it was difficult to fully assess patients, although we performed basic observations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, nobody was ill enough to warrant a hospital visit. My impression is that the majority of these problems were secondary to the poor hygiene and sanitation in the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also several chronic conditions that in the UK are easy to treat, however with no money or access to hospitals, were impossible to treat there. For example, we met an elderly lady who was blind from her cataracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, an elderly man with a colostomy bag who had a recent operation in Adana, and did not have enough money to visit the hospital for his clinic follow-up appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not have any replacement colostomy bags and was worried about infection. Luckily there was no infection and we arranged to get a supply of replacement bags for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We met a young girl with Thalassemia Major (severe anemia). She had been very weak, malnourished and developing recurrent skin infections. Fortunately, during our visit, a government hospital in Turkey accepted admission for free treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, we met a young boy with cerebral palsy whose mother complained of his poor swallow. He was severely malnourished. In the UK, this young boy would have had intense multidisciplinary team (MDT) input and an acceptable quality of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had already aspirated on several occasions and been treated for chest infections, and the reality is that each subsequent infection could potentially be a terminal event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We reviewed approximately 200 patients during our visit. It was not an easy task given the limited facilities, language barrier, cultural differences and the heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, in between clinics we helped with food packing and distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For anyone contemplating medical humanitarian work, I cannot recommend it enough. It will challenge your skills in practising medicine outside of your comfort zone, and also give you the opportunity to travel the world and gain a humbling insight into peoples' lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole experience was a memorable one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I left Adana with an immense respect for the Syrian people who despite their hardship, persevere with life and do not let their situation affect their spirit, character and kind-heartedness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although we did as much as possible, I feel they were no more than short-term solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UAN have set aside funds for sanitation, hygiene packs, but also empowerment projects where they may be able to become self-sustainable through small crafts and businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What distressed me the most was the feeling of helplessness at not being able to do more for these people who found themselves in their circumstances by no fault of their own. Some of the children I met, around the age of eight, will be working in the field next year and so will have no chance of an education and hence a future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is true in any society afflicted by conflict, poverty and oppression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will continue to help in any way I can and hope to visit soon again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, as I write this report from the comfort of my home, I know that the beautiful people I had the pleasure of meeti`ng will be in their tents tonight, exposed to the harsh Turkish climate, which in a few months' time will turn extremely cold. I count my blessings for every day I have food, shelter, and easy access to a quality health service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I only hope that there is a political solution for Syrians, and anyone across the world enduring similar hardships.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I first met the Masto family in Lebanon in the spring of 2016. I was reporting on Syrian refugees and met Ibtisam, the mother, at the farmers' market where she had a stall selling different kinds of kibbeh, the Middle Eastern dish of bulgur wheat pastry, usually stuffed with lamb and onions. She and her six children had fled Jisr al-Shughur, a city in the north of Syria, in 2013 after enduring months of fighting: bodies in the streets, no electricity, scarce food, a kidnap epidemic. Her husband Mohammed worked as a plumber in Lebanon, and after a nail-biting, bone-jarring 24-hour journey of buses and checkpoints, they joined him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I met them, they were living in a windowless concrete room in the outskirts of Beirut. They had just been told they were going to be resettled in the United States, but they didn't yet know which city. They were nervous (and this was pre-Donald Trump) about how a Muslim family would be received. I looked at the family: at the two older girls, Amal and Asmaa, hovering in the doorway in long gowns and headscarves; at their brother Khaled, 14, respectfully bringing my translator and I cups of tea; the two younger girls, Sidra and Israa, trying to suppress their excitement at the visitors; and the littlest, Mohammed-Nour, then only four. They were a pious family; Mohammed had declined to shake my hand and touched his hand to his breast instead. Ibtisam wore a long black coat buttoned to her throat and her headscarf was neatly pleated and pinned around her face. None of them spoke a word of English. I tried to reassure them, but I was worried too. How would this conservative family from a provincial corner of Syria, traumatised by war, manage in the US?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were sent to Cincinnati, Ohio. We kept in touch. Ibtisam wrote, via Facebook, that the first few months were difficult. They had been put in a house infested with raccoons, in a rough neighbourhood with drug dealers on the corners. When Trump was elected I messaged Ibtisam, sending my love. Google translate rendered a garbled version of her reply: &quot;My children are well placed in school and always marked by excellent grades. Thank God. But I do not know what we do as Muslims. After the elections, Trump and I are afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, a year after the family first arrived in Cincinnati, I went to visit them. They had moved to a slightly better neighbourhood and now lived in a modest two-storey, three-bedroom house on a typical suburban street of similar houses, each with a front lawn and a backyard, a chain-link fence, and a barbecue. I knocked on the door. The windows were curtained. It was Ramadan and dusk, the hour when the fast is broken. The door opened with a burst of laughter. And there was Ibtisam wearing a short-sleeved tunic with pink and blue flowers, grinning broadly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amal and Asmaa were also bareheaded, though only because they were among family and the guests were women. Khaled and his father wore baggy basketball shorts. I was introduced to two friends: Carol Gates, a local volunteer and Anwar Mhajne, a Palestinian-Israeli graduate student at the University of Cincinnati who helped out with translation. The table was laid with a Syrian feast, Ibtisam's signature kibbeh, made with a pomegranate molasses sauce. There was stuffed courgettes and vine leaves, salad and lamb. We ate through the mountains of food, talked and laughed. I saw that all the Mastos had put on weight. Everyone was smiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's administration increased the annual quota of refugees from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 in 2017. After his inauguration, Trump issued his infamous travel ban, affecting seven predominantly-Muslim countries-Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen-for 90 days. He also cut the refugee quota to 50,000 and specifically banned Syrian refugees indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee resettlement in the US is overseen by different agencies in different cities. In Cincinnati, it is Catholic Charities. This year they had been prepared to welcome about 450 refugees but, Kelly Anchrum, their Communications Director, told me that due to the travel ban, &quot;we are expecting the numbers to be far less.&quot; In practice, she said, only refugees who can claim a close family tie to someone already in the US are being let in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of outrage at Trump's travel ban, multiple legal challenges were immediately mounted and a temporary restraining order was issued against it in February. Trump subsequently issued an amended executive order dropping Iraq from the list and rescinding the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. This too was prevented from going into effect by a temporary judicial restraining order. In June the Supreme Court issued an interim ruling upholding some of the provisions of the ban and deferred the final decision until this autumn. The status of pre-approved refugees remains caught in the legal muddle. For many, the promised opportunities of America have been put on hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's immigration policy has been accompanied by a rabid &quot;America First,&quot; nativist rhetoric. During his presidential campaign he called for a Muslim registry and a wall along the Mexican border. His rallies were often violent and brawly and his victory seemed to suggest that he had tapped into some kind of popular prejudice with his raving bigotry. Enboldened, far-right groups stepped out of the shadows. In Charlottesville, Virginia in August a member of one of them drove a car into a crowd that had gathered to protest against a far-right rally. One woman was killed in the attack and more than a dozen people injured. In this kind of febrile, polarised atmosphere how would the Mastos fit in?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each refugee arriving in the US has been subject to thorough vetting (see box overleaf), that can last between two and four years, before they can get on a plane. Their asylum is pre-approved. Despite this, in the aftermath of the 2015 Paris attacks, two dozen American governors-including Ohio's own, Republican John Kasich, and Indiana's Mike Pence, who is now Vice President-tried to halt Syrians from being resettled in their states because some of the Paris attackers had reportedly entered Europe posing as Syrian refugees. Ultimately, the governors failed, but controversy flared up. At that time, Anchrum told me, &quot;we got more messages of support and positive calls than ever: people asking, how can I help?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On arrival in the US, each refugee family is given $1,075 per member by the federal government. In Cincinnati, the Catholic Charities organisation strives to secure employment for refugees within three months. They provide a house with donated furniture, but rent must be paid out of the family's allocated funds. For three months, English lessons, drivers and translators are provided. After this, the refugees are substantially on their own, although support can continue for several years. They do not have green cards yet, but do have all the rights of citizens except the right to vote. They can, for example, get Medicaid coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything is geared around getting a job. All further federal assistance (training or language lessons, for example) are designed with that in mind. &quot;You can't be paternalistic,&quot; Ted Bergh, the CEO of Catholic Charities, told me, &quot;and do everything for the refugees.&quot; After eight months, a refugee family is expected to begin to repay the travel loan from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which paid their airfare. This mechanism allows them to establish an all-important credit score.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catholic Charities found Mohammed a job at a vegetable processing plant for $10 an hour. The fumes from the chemicals that were used to wash the vegetables irritated his eyes and after four months he quit. For a while, Amal, aged 20, deemed too old to go to school, was the sole breadwinner, working in a different produce plant. The younger children were in school, but the family felt isolated in a downtrodden neighbourhood. &quot;Everyone was blaming me that I had brought them to this place,&quot; Ibtisam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Gates-petite, blonde, 50-something, an empty nester who was already involved in volunteering with Bhutanese</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refugees-was assigned by Catholic Charities as the Mastos' driver for their first three months. Cincinnati is green and hilly, a sprawling low-density conurbation connected with looping highways, built for cars, not pedestrians. There are buses, but no metro or train network. Carol ferried the Mastos between schools, work, the Catholic Charities HQ, language classes and shops. But she found the family needed more than transport. Without English it was almost impossible for them to navigate the bureaucracy of medical forms, tax returns, driving licences, electricity bills and social security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol incurred the opprobrium of Catholic Charities for continuing to help the Mastos after three months. She was a hand to hold but, more importantly, a friend. Her presence said: you are not alone here. She became part of the family. The Masto children called her their &quot;other mother.&quot; &quot;When Carol went on holiday,&quot; Ibtisam told me, only half joking, &quot;I almost had a nervous breakdown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol was not the only local helping the new arrivals. Several Arab-Americans, like Anwar, served as translators. I talked to one, Basma Akbik, a Syrian-American whose husband, also Syrian-American, is a doctor who takes a medical team and supplies to treat Syrian refugees in Jordan several times a year. Basma was volunteering as a translator at a hospital when she met Ibtisam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if it was her Aleppo accent, which is my mother's city,&quot; Basma told me, &quot;but I gave her my phone number. I wanted to help, I saw a lot of potential in her.&quot; The two women have since begun to set up a catering company together, harnessing Ibtisam's cooking skills. Basma had bought equipment and invested in a website. They had done several jobs, one of which involved catering a party for a businessman who had been thrilled to employ a Syrian and welcomed them warmly. When Ibtisam asked to meet his wife, he pointed to a man and said, &quot;actually it's that guy in the suit.&quot; Basma told me that Ibtisam had been taken aback, but that she had impressed upon her that this was America: you had to accept and respect everyone. Ibtisam had thought about it and agreed, yes, they were a very friendly couple, even if they were gay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's blowhard xenophobia has given free rein to pockets of racism, but it has also created stiff resistance. Democratic politicians all over the country have rebutted his policies with declarations of noncompliance. In January, the Democratic mayor declared Cincinnati a &quot;sanctuary city,&quot; which meant that along with others-New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco-it would not enforce federal laws against undocumented illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I found Cincinnati (a city that voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential contest, but Republican in Senate and Congressional races) a more multiculturally-tolerant place than its red-state midwest profile would suggest. Basma told me that as a Syrian-American and a Muslim she had been heartened that after the travel ban, several conservative right-wing parents at her son's private Catholic high school sent her messages of support and solidarity. In February, when tensions were running high, Catholic Charities brought together an interfaith coalition at events to challenge, explain and refute the fear of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not only what our faith tells us we should do,&quot; Bergh told me, &quot;it's what America is about, it is what the Statue of Liberty stands as a symbol of: helping people in trouble.&quot; It was a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sentiment I heard echoed at local church groups, and mosques and many volunteer organisations in the Cincinnati area, who were all helping to support refugees. And it was a sentiment echoed by the outpouring of condemnation, overt and tacit, from business groups, the leaders of the Armed Services and Republicans after Trump said that there were some &quot;very fine people&quot; among the neo-Nazi groups that rallied in Charlottesville. Despite the electoral attraction of Trump's drain-the-Washington-swamp message, it increasingly seems that his anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-Muslim rhetoric has less appeal than we once feared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iwent with the Mastos to the Clifton Mosque to mark the end of Ramadan. The imam, Ismaeel Chartier, is a big, red-headed Irish-American former wrestler from Hell's Kitchen in New York. He greeted Trump's inauguration by declaring the mosque a sanctuary building for undocumented migrants. (He later had to qualify this when Hispanics worried that the mosque could become a target in its own right.) Ibtisam enthusiastically pointed out the multiethnic congregation, &quot;every people from every area, every country!&quot; Africans in brightly coloured robes, Yemenis with tasseled turbans, Libyans in white-knit prayer caps. The women's balcony was a riot of multicoloured prints and sequined scarves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the prayers, there was coffee and donuts and then a barbecue. The kids jumped on the bouncy castle, Amal and Asmaa met up with other teenage girls. Ibtisam introduced me to her friends, a mix of Middle Eastern accents. &quot;Faith brings people together,&quot; said one woman, originally from Morocco. I got talking to an elderly African-American man. He had been dismayed at Trump's anti-Muslim stance, but was heartened that so many officials and ordinary people had stood up against his ban. He waved his hand over the mingling throng, &quot;this is what America should be,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mosque was a happy example of multiculturalism, under the roof of one religion. Amal, the eldest daughter, admitted that it was not always easy to wear the hijab on the bus. &quot;People say the not-good word.&quot; She wouldn't tell me what that word was. The longer I spent with the Mastos and other Syrian refugees, the more I appreciated the deep and disquieting alienation they experienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day Mohammed asked me why Mexicans worked so hard. I had to think carefully how to answer. I said maybe it was because Mexicans chose to come to America, that they came to work and that many Mexicans had come before so they probably knew what to expect. As I said this I realised that a refugee has made no such choice. They have been forced to leave their country. The Mastos didn't want to come to America. For them resettlement was not just about figuring out practicalities, but a more profound reckoning with identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed had found it the most difficult. After he quit his first job, he got another at a different vegetable processing factory, but he clashed with his supervisor who apparently wouldn't rotate him off celery, a repetitive, heavy-lifting job. The day before I arrived he had been fired; the exact circumstances were a bit confused. He has another job now, but Ibtisam told me she worried that her husband felt he could not find his place in America. &quot;He shouts and the Americans don't understand that this is just his normal way of speaking.&quot; Mohammed told me he was frustrated he could not work as a plumber without the language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What can I do?&quot; He spread his hands wide in a gesture of fatalism. &quot;I am illiterate even in Arabic.&quot; We were sitting in his backyard; Anwar was translating. Fireflies flashed in the gloaming. Mohammed recounted a litany of disappointments and slights. &quot;My kids are not mine, they will be American,&quot; he said. &quot;I am convinced I won't live long. I am 50, perhaps I have 20 years left. I am close to the cemetery.&quot; He closed his eyes and his chin dropped to his chest. A long painful silence ensued. When he looked up again he said, &quot;I want to be independent and to support my family and live in dignity. Every father wants the best for their children and if they can't give them this, they might as well commit suicide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children were doing well in school and picking up English. After just a year, little Mohammed-Nour, now six, spoke with a shy American accent. He told me he loved to hear stories about Syria because he didn't remember it. &quot;When I get a green card, I will go to Syria!&quot; His older sisters were haltingly conversant, and Ibtisam talked a mile a minute in a mix of broken English, hand gestures and frequent recourse to Google translate. But Mohammed's outbursts of anger affected the whole family. He had recently confiscated the girls' mobile phones. &quot;I saw them do something not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">acceptable.&quot; When I asked him how he would navigate being the Muslim father of four daughters in a society with different moral principles, he replied severely, &quot;It doesn't matter if we are in the US or on the moon, traditions are traditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anxiety and trauma manifested themselves in a profusion of health conditions among the family. Mohammed had type 2 diabetes, which recently led his doctor to advise him to give up on his Ramadan fast. Amal and Asmaa were both being treated for depression. Asmaa had suffered catatonic fits. Amal had been diagnosed with Crohn's disease, a nasty bowel condition exacerbated by stress. &quot;Every day,&quot; she told me, &quot;I have to take eight tablets.&quot; But it wasn't all bad news. Carol had persisted when they were told Amal was &quot;too old,&quot; and found a way for her to enrol in high school with her younger siblings. She loved her English teacher, and talked hopefully about college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol drove them all between doctors' appointments. Mohammed had to be hospitalised with high blood pressure. Israa fell off a running machine. Ibtisam needed minor surgery, got glasses with the wrong prescription, complained of headaches. At the end of the summer she lost her job at an industrial sewing factory after disappearing for too many medical appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mastos' favourite nurse-practitioner, Denise Pattison, young, energetic and sympathetic, told me she had treated Syrian refugees for everything from insomnia to poorly-healed bullet wounds. She saw a lot of refugees-Somalis, Congolese, Ethiopians as well as trafficked women from Honduras and El Salvador-with problems aggravated by stress and trauma. She told me that it was hard for the Masto girls to understand that they were still suffering the damage of war, and that their mental anguish was not somehow their own fault or a punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Ramadan, the Syrian refugees visited each other's houses each night to eat. The women sat at one end of the room, the men at the other, smoking and talking, occasionally calling out for tea. The kids ran about, the adults worried. One woman was on dialysis and needed a kidney transplant; she missed the sons she had to leave in Turkey. The men complained about their low-paid jobs, and I marvelled one afternoon to see Ibtisam lecture them on the American work ethic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ibtisam was determined to have her own restaurant. It was unclear if she would try to make the catering company work with Basma. She said that coming to America had been harder than she had thought, &quot;but I am happy because the kids have more opportunities. My happiness is my kids.&quot; The Mastos' experience, despite Trump, echoed that of waves of refugees and immigrants that had come before them. Hope was invested in the second generation. When I checked back in with them at the end of the summer, Carol wrote that Ibtisam had begun helping out more recently arrived Syrian refugees, by driving them around and giving advice. Ibtisam missed her yellow kitchen in Jisr al-Shughur with a view of the river, but the mighty Ohio and the greenness of Cincinnati reminded her of home. And when she said &quot;Cincinnati&quot; she pronounced it with a perfect sing-song midwest accent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve former Australians of the Year have condemned the actions of the Australian government on Manus Island, as Papua New Guinean police and immigration officers entered the detention centre on Thursday morning, demanding that detainees leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The open letter, signed by Australians of the Year between 1983 and 2015, pleaded with the Australian government to restore essential services and allow doctors to treat the 380 men who remain inside the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'I cannot leave my neighbour hungry': support for refugees from priest and major on Manus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The situation inside the centre is deteriorating, and the letter warned it was &quot;inevitable&quot; that people would become sick and even die because of the lack of food and water, medical care and sanitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This treatment does not represent who we are as Australians, or indeed as human beings,&quot; said the open letter, signed by former honorees including Rosie Batty, Ita Buttrose, Patrick McGorry, Tim Flannery and Mick Dodson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We plead with you to immediately restore all essential services to the men on Manus Island. Please allow the Australian Medical Association to provide medical and preventive care, as they have recently offered, as soon as possible. At the same time please find safe haven for the acknowledged genuine refugees without any further delay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter also expressed concern about Australia's international reputation on human rights. It said responsibility for the situation lay with Australia, not Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems our major political parties have failed to meet the most basic obligations under the United Nations refugee convention, one that our country helped to negotiate and which we signed in 1951.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the signatories, Simon McKeon, the chancellor of Monash University and former chair of AMP, said getting Australians of the Year together on an issue was a &quot;once-in-a-blue-moon sort of thing&quot; but they all felt strongly about the Manus crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end of the day my own view is that in the circles I move we well understand the reasons why governments and oppositions over a period of time have been so focused on the deterrent aspect of what we've done on Nauru and Manus Island,&quot; he told Guardian Australia. &quot;But time has gone on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKeon said observing the deterrence policy over the years had left him with an understanding of it even if he didn't fully accept it, but he was &quot;now challenging whether that particular argument is justifying what is going at the moment, and entitling us to receive the international criticism we're plainly getting at the moment&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For my part I don't see any rational argument anymore that says not doing what the AMA is [calling for] is in any way consistent with the deterrent argument. There's a complete disconnect there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis at the former immigration detention centre is entering its fourth week, as human rights groups and foreign governments voice concern and outrage at the deteriorating situation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday PNG police said they would await the outcome of a legal appeal before conducting &quot;Operation Helpim Friends&quot;, which would &quot;politely&quot; ask the detainees to leave voluntarily. The police commissioner, Gari Baki, said no force would be used. But he added that the notorious paramilitary mobile squad would be on hand to assist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behrouz Boochani, a journalist and refugee inside the centre, said on Thursday the mobile squad and immigration officers had come into the camp and were &quot;shouting at us to leave&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said refugees were gathering together in one compound and some had climbed on the roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So many police mobile squad and immigration officers came inside the prison camp. They are shouting at us to leave the prison camp. Some of the refugees are gathering in Delta compound and some are on the roof.- Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 22, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Too much tension in Delta compound. Hundreds of refugees gathering in Delta right now. An Australian Federal Police officer is guiding PNG police mobile squad, there are about 50 mobile squad police that are threatening people to leave.- Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 22, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers &quot;in large numbers&quot; were demanding the men hand over phones and stop recording their activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men have said they fear for their safety in the Lorengau community, and organisations including the UN high commissioner for refugees have said the accommodation built for them is not ready or secure enough. Authorities are preventing food, water and medical care from getting to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few weeks there have been break-ins and protests at the alternative accommodation sites, and medical emergencies inside the centre. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immigration and police started searching the rooms and are saying &quot;Move Move&quot;, you only have an hour to move. Too much stress and tension here in Delta. Some refugees are crying.- Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 22, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week members of the Australian Medical Association voted unanimously to call on the government to allow doctors access to the centre, to assess the men's health and living conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus humanitarian crisis a 'damning indictment' of Australia's refugee policy: UNHCR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The AMA has made many representations on this matter, both publicly and in private but, with a worsening and more dangerous situation emerging on Manus, the federal council strongly believes that urgent action and answers are needed,&quot; said the AMA president, Michael Gannon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday the UNHCR said the humanitarian crisis was human-made and entirely preventable. It was a &quot;damning indictment of a policy meant to avoid Australia's international obligations&quot;, said Nai Jit Lam, the UNHCR's deputy regional representative in Canberra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has remained resolute in its policy, dismissing criticism and rejecting offers of help, including from New Zealand to take 150 refugees and to separately provide $2.7m to PNG to provide essential services. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also warned New Zealand against making any deals with PNG without Australia, suggesting that would affect diplomatic relations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salah Mustafa does not have a vote in Germany's general election on Sunday. But if Angela Merkel wins as widely expected, he may be one of those who helped her to victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mustafa is a Syrian refugee, but he doesn't fit the popular stereotype. He is not religious. He speaks fluent German, despite not knowing a word of the language when he arrived three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He works and pays taxes. He pays his share of the rent at the small flat where he lives with two German flatmates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The softly-spoken 34-year-old lives in Cologne, the city that became synonymous with the controversy over Mrs Merkel's refugee policy  following the New Year sex attacks of 2015.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mrs Merkel faces a backlash from voters anywhere in Germany, you could be forgiven for thinking it would be here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it has not materialised. Instead her Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) made dramatic gains in regional elections here in May. If the opinion polls are right, she is set to make similar gains here in Sunday's general election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AfD has made huge political headway with a campaign almost exclusively based on opposition to Mrs Merkel's refugee policy is a disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has faced angry protests at almost every campaign stop in the East from crowds who accuse her of &quot;ruining Germany&quot; and attempt to drown her speeches with chants of &quot;Merkel must go&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her own Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), in open revolt over refugee policy for much of the last two years, has agreed an uneasy truce for the sake of winning the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But its leader Horst Seehofer says he will demand an annual limit on the number of refugees allowed into the country as the price of his support for a coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salah Mustafa, who speaks fluent German, joins an informal meeting of&nbsp;the group &quot;Cologne Brings us Together' in a barCredit:      Craig Stennett / Telegraph     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But far from turning against her, Cologne has been at the heart of a remarkable comeback for Mrs Merkel - one that may be at least in part down to Mr Mustafa and others like him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love Cologne, it has been so good to me,&quot; he says. He is sitting in a typical working-class pub in the west of the city, at a mixed table of Germans and refugees. It's a meeting of Cologne Brings Us Together, a local group of volunteers who help refugees find their way in the city. Mr Mustafa is one of the organisers: his German is so good he translates for newcomers. He is responsible for the group's outreach, posting on Facebook in Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the asylum-seekers drink beer, some strick to soft drinks. In the corner a couple of Iranians are playing table football. It's the sort of place where you might expect trouble when Mr Mustafa switches to Arabic for the benefit of a new arrival, but the Germans at surrounding tables don't even look up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Germans protest over wave of sexual assaults on women in Cologne       01:04</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Merkel was widely derided for her migrant crisis slogan of &quot;We can do it&quot;, but the group gathered here is evidence that, in some cases at least, she may have been right. The table is a model of successful integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mustafa arrived in Germany in 2014, a year before the big influx. His home village in northern Syria was under Islamic State in Iraq and the Levany (Isil) control. He trained as a lawyer in Syria, but his qualifications did not enable him to practise in Germany. He spoke no German.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So he started again. He learnt the language. He got a job at a workshop that repairs electrical appliances. He'd never done such work before, but he was a quick student. &quot;He's so good he fixed my washing machine when it broke,&quot; Jana Offergeld, one of the German volunteers in the group says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was offered a job at Bayer, the German chemical giant, but decided to retrain as a social worker instead. &quot;I missed working with people,&quot; he says. He spends much of his spare time working to help other refugees make it in Cologne. After the New Year sex attacks of 2015 he was one of the organisers of a rally in support of the victims under the banner &quot;Syrians Against Sexism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German election poll tracker</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the table from him is another Syrian. Hussein will not give his surname because he fears it may endanger his family, who live in an area controlled by the Assad regime. Hussein arrived in 2015 at the height of the migrant crisis, after Mrs Merkel threw Germany's borders open to more than 1m asylum-seekers. A qualified electrical engineer, he was unable to work at first because he spoke no German.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He studied hard and mastered the language in less than two years. He now has a job at a German electrical company. &quot;Working in Germany is better than working in Syria,&quot; he says. &quot;It's more efficient. And here everyone at the factory specialises in one thing. In Syria you have to do everything yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mustafa is Kurdish and Hussein is Arab, but both insist such differences do not interest them. &quot;In Syria Kurds are fighting against Arabs and Muslims against other religions, but that is in Syria,&quot; Mr Mustafa says. &quot;We are in Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election campaign has at times appeared something of a victory procession for Mrs Merkel, but as recently as last year, many were writing her political obituaries. Six months ago she still looked in serious trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her decision to open Germany's borders to asylum-seekers in 2015 was deeply divisive. As the sheer numbers pouring in became clear, her party plummetted in the polls - as did her personal approval ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When more than 1,200 women were assaulted a in Cologne city centre on New Year's Eve a few months later, &nbsp;and the overhwelming majority of suspects were asylum-seekers, Mrs Merkel's position looked even more precarious. She suffered a serious of damaging losses in regional elections across the country, while the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) made big gains campaigning on an anti-immigrant platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarkably, it was in Cologne that her comeback began. In regional elections in May, the CDU made dramatic inroads in Cologne and surrounding cities that are traditionally strongholds for the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) led by Martin Schulz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian refugee Salah Mustafa outside Cologne Cathedral, GermanyCredit:      Craig Stennett / Telegraph     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, CDU campaigners in the city said they found refugees weren't an issue for most voters. &quot;Cologne has moved on,&quot; Wolfgang Gaertner, a CDU volunteer said. &quot; It was a big deal two years ago but it's under control now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional polling figures ahead of Sunday's vote tell an interesting story. If the polls are right, Mrs Merkel and the CDU are heading for losses to the AfD in the former communist East, but will make up for them with gains in traditional SPD areas in the West like Cologne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, that is down to regional differences between the sparsely populated East, which has little experience of immigration, and more cosmopolitan cities like Cologne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cologne is a very open society. I think it's an important part of people's self-identity to be open-minded here,&quot; says Mr Mustafa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a case to be made that Mrs Merkel's refugee policy may even have helped her in these traditionally left-leaning areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profile | Angela Merkel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Merkel's losing votes in the east and holding up overall, she must be gaining them somewhere,&quot; says Dr Carsten Koschmieder, a political scientist at Berlin's Free University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm not convinced people are voting for the CDU because of her refugee policy. Rather, I think people look at the situation and say it's under control. She said she could handle it and she's handling it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that is the case, successfully integrated refugees like Mr Mustafa and Hussein may have played a crucial role in convincing voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Matt Qvortrup, a political scientist at Coventry University and biographer of Mrs Merkel, believes it may have been success stories like theirs she had in mind when she opened Germany's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it was ever really a moral cause for Merkel,&quot; Prof Qvortrup says. &quot;I think she was coming under a lot of pressure from German industry, which was saying we need young qualified workers and we need to take advantage of the refugee crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an ageing population and low birth rate, Germany was facing a looming demographic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were talking about the way Jews who fled the Nazis in Germany became such a successful core of the economy in the US and saying Syrians could do the same and Germany should take the opportunity,&quot; says Prof Qvortrup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an analysis that does not go down well with the AfD and the German right, who claim most asylum-seekers are economic migrants masquerading as refugees, who are after German jobs and have no intention of ever returning to their own countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, despite their good lives in Germany, both Mr Mustafa and Hussein say they will return to Syria if the situation improves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the civil war ends and Assad is gone, I will go back to Syria, even if I have a good job here,&quot; says Hussein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Syria is in our hearts,&quot; says Mr Mustafa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Lebanon is only half the size of Wales, and has a population of four million. It is currently home to an estimated 1.5 million Syrians who have fled over the border in the last six years of civil war, making around one in four people a refugee. The conditions for most, however, are abysmal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee response in Lebanon is no longer in the emergency stages - but two huge fires that ripped through Qab Elias and Mar Elias settlements earlier this month have shown just how precarious existence for so many Syrians here continues to be, trapped in a cycle of poverty and debt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airbnb is letting people in Milan offer their homes to refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees have brought macro benefits in the form of international financial injections to prop up the country's antiquated water and sewage systems, as well as failing schools in rural areas which now teach more Syrian than Lebanese children. Despite the fact 71 per cent live below the poverty line,studies estimate that through the buying of goods and housingthe refugee population has actually added millions to the Lebanese economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a country with a notoriously ineffective government - public services barely function - and where unemployment rates are already high, the authorities are wary of creating incentives for Syrians to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Palestinians who fled their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War came to Lebanon, where they have been for generations: unable to claim citizenship, they are in effect second class citizens, confined to claustrophobic concrete ghettos still known as 'camps'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Syria's war broke out in 2011, the Lebanese government immediately outlawed the creation of official government-run camps in the hopes that the fighting would die down and Syrians would not choose to stay. The decision has made the job of aid organisations more difficult, as they must tread a line between providing the basic services Syrians need to survive, and making them - in the government's eyes - too comfortable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Lebanon's Syrian population actually lives in towns and cities - in abandoned buildings or farmsteads, or often at the mercy of landlords who threaten to expose families' unregistered status to blackmail them into paying higher rents. Most have moved into already highly overcrowded Palestinian areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Bekaa Valley, however, fields of white tents and other makeshift settlements dot the landscape. The agricultural area is one of the poorest in the country, and the 39 per cent of Syrians who live here are some of the most impoverished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are actually lucky that fires like this don't happen more often,&quot; Utpal Moitra, Unicef's Chief Field Officer for the Bekaa and Baalbek-Hermelgovernorate said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camps most Syrians live in in the region have been built piecemeal, using whatever materials are at hand or help the UN and NGOs are able to give. As a result, many tents or semi-permanent breeze block structures are built too close together, and if they're lucky enough to have an electricity supply, the wiring is often amateur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fires are very common, usually started by faulty wiring or because families use gas canisters to cook inside their tents. Normally, however, they are contained quickly, catching maybe one or two tents at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Qab Elias and Mar Elias, the July heat wave and wheat crop surrounding the sites meant the blazes had spread across almost the entire camps before fire services (run by volunteers in Lebanon) were able to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole site went up in about 10 minutes,&quot; said Lynn Bou Saba, who works for local charity World Vision at sites including Qab Elias. &quot;No one had time to think, it was just run. So many families have lost their papers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the camps are not exactly built to high quality specifications, it's not a surprise that fire safety procedures are not in place either. Qab Elias is surrounded by a ditch through which a small stream runs; when the tents first went up a few years ago, it was decided to put up a fence to stop children falling into it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QabElias Syrian refugee camp fire: Locals in Lebanon help residents who lost everything</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the fire that proved to be incredibly dangerous - there was only one gate for all 700 people to scramble through. For those furthest away, it was a challenge to reach safety through the heat and smoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents said that there were a few fire extinguishers around the camp which they tried to use, but they had expired a year ago, rendering them useless as people's homes and meagre possessions were destroyed in front of their eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebuilding is already underway at a remarkable pace at both camps - and the new semi-permanent timber frame and concrete base homes, covered with tarpaulin, will be built to safer specifications. Most will even have their own latrines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some ways it is a fresh start. But the trauma of it? A dead child? I don't think anyone here would say it was worth it,&quot; Ms Bou Saba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As some of the camp's residents took a break from rebuilding to rest in the midday sun, a van from the Lebanese Red Cross pulled up, parking near the charred remains of what was the administrative centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a small gazebo for shade, they unload several new fire extinguishers, along with a small generator. One of the men nudges a fire extinguisher with his foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a fire that big breaks out again, they are probably useless to contain it,&quot; he said. &quot;But still. Like everything here, it's better than nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have spoken out ahead of national Hate Crime Week and a series of events aimed at strengthening relationships with BME groups in Cardiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes a community cooking contest which will see 40 women from 19 different communities battle it out in the kitchen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amateur chefs from across the world will be getting involved in the Master Chef-style contest, which is being staged bySouth Wales Policeand Women Connect First to forge closer ties between the police and black and minority ethnic (BME) communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event kick-started a programme of 10 heats which are taking place over the next few months at Stephen Gomes' The Food Studio, with 40 Cardiff-based chefs hoping to secure a place in January's final.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what life is like in a refugee camp for the Rohingya people fleeing Myanmar</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a three-year-old Feryal Alshayeb fled the war in Palestine on her birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was one of 16 people, including family and friends, to climb into a car and head to Jordan for sanctuary away from all the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feryal, now 52 and a mum-of-four, later left the country, which was home to her mum's family, and moved to Italy where she lived with her former husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There she worked for the Italian Home Office and at a hospital offering interpretation skills in a bid to cover the cost of her rent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Feryal, of Sloper Road,, said it was her marriage break-up and encouragement from a relative which led her to find sanctuary in Cardiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wales donates &pound;100k for Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel safe as my background is coming from war,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was in Palestine for three years as we left our country on my birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mother's family lived in Jordan and my father started to build a home and we went there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From Jordan we could see Palestine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember my grandfather wanted to die over inbut it was not allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I got married I went to Italy and was working as an interpreter for the Italian Home Office and a hospital with refugees to pay the rent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was a relative who convinced her to leave Italy and move to the Welsh capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I only had one relative who lived in Cardiff before, he said to me 'come and see, it's a nice city'. I said 'no I can't' - I refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said he went to get a ticket for me and had a house and everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My oldest son did not want to stay. After one month he wanted to go to Italy but he now likes Cardiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cardiff is out city, it's a quiet city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have water, it's green, the people are lovely, they are friendly. I feel safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feryal speaks with pride over what her four children have achieved. She is mum to Mohamed, aged 22, Ahmed, aged 20, Sara, aged 18, and thirteen-year-old Omar, who she says she brought up single-handedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have four children. Three are in university, one is in Swansea, another is in the University of West London and my daughter has started university in Preston and studies law. My son is in school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said after arriving in Cardiff in 2009, she started volunteering at Women Connect, where she learned English and said her children's &quot;Welsh accent is perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My teacher says my son talks like he was born from here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went back to Jordan, and wanted to go home to Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people are friendly and everything is nice and natural, the street, the park and houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actress Alice Evans said her career suffered after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since working in Wales she revealed was she was only out of work for two months and that was due to her suffering an injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I came here I found a job in a restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The owner spoke Arabic so I started in Falafel Wales in Canton, I was there for a year-and-a-half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was two months without work because I had problems with my leg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She now cooks food at a care home for the elderly, which has 31 residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I now work inPontcannaHouse inCantonand cook traditional food.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the three winning dishes at the launch was prepared by Feryal, after she went head-to-head withCardiff Baypolice officers Gary Evans, Ian Randall and Joe Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Feryal said she was unable to sleep before the cookery launch event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't sleep as it's exciting,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Benabas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Benabas fled her home country of Algeria to give hope to her desperately ill son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mum-of-three was unable to get the care she needed in her home country for Sidali so she headed to Britain to help get him vital treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it was a tough decision to leave her home country of Algeria behind and head to the Welsh capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally permitted to stay for a month, her son underwent six months of treatment and, due to being an asylum seeker, Sarah and her family have leave to remain in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bride and groom go to watch rugby game on their wedding day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah, 46, of Albany Road in Cardiff, whose husband Sedik Benabas, aged 60, works in a restaurant, said: &quot;My husband and my friend came here but I had no family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of my three sons has severe epilepsy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two of my children are with my mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son, he was very ill and we came here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had problems in Algeria and so we came here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's difficult for me without family and learning to speak English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My first languages are Arabic and French.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She first arrived in Britain back in March 2011 but she revealed she struggled to settle in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she has embraced the time she has spent in Cardiff and is determined to put the hours in to improve her English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cardiff Bus fares are increasing and it's being blamed on congestion and running costs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah said: &quot;I work every day on my English. I did GCSE maths and English, I worked very hard and I am good at writing English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All my teachers have told me that. I did my foundation in my new college in Cardiff. I have done science and French.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is very much focused on the future and creating a career for herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to be a teaching assistant,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to have experience in primary school. I will volunteer and train and afterwards I will be a teaching assistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before that I will gain skills and experience, as I do volunteering with Women Connect and teach elderly people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah said Cardiff reminded her of her home country and was glad she had decided to move here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Algeria is a beautiful country. Cardiff, I find, is like my area of Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to live in London and I did not like it. People here are all smiling and I am not scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like my home, I love Cardiff. It's similar to my country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she said there was a difference in her relationship with the police here compared to in Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here the police are better than the police in Algeria,&quot; she said. &quot;I think here all of them are good people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merbouha Kessour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tragedy has plagued the life of Merbouha Kessour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 54-year-old, ofTremorfa, was forced to leave Algeria for Britain as she feared for her children's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merbouha, who had three children, lost her middle son when he was just four to hepatitis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She moved to Britain in 2003 to protect her family but she suffered even more heartache when her husband Noureddine died four years later.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had three boys in Algeria but the middle son died of hepatitis when he was just four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My husband in 2003 decided to apply for asylum in Britain we had letters and were offered settled status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was very hard. I came with my husband and the two boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two years later my husband Noureddine was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer and he passed away in 2007.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her late husband was just 48 at the time of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her life was thrown into further turmoil as she suffered the agony of grief once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Welsh company's opera was pulled because it cast Caucasian singers as Asian characters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I lost my father two years ago,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Cardiff people are very friendly and they have helped me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also suffered an accident which has impacted her mobility and is now unable to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Merbouha, being able to take part in the cookery contest was an opportunity she enjoyed as it was a chance to mix with other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all cooked together, I made Arabic Kabasa,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was very relaxed. It was my first time to cook in a hotel with a big kitchen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toddlers and babies are sleeping rough in northern France, volunteers say, amid warnings that scores of destitute refugee families have returned or arrived in the area since the demolition of the &quot;Jungle&quot; camp last year. Photographs provided to The Independent by charities working on the ground in Dunkirk show babies less than a year old sleeping and crawling around in the woodland of one of a number of unofficial camps that have sprung up in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 20 infants are said to be in the camp, which reportedly accommodates between 300 and 500 people, many of them whole families including grandparents and pregnant mothers. Most were former residents of the the Jungle camp in Calais and the Grande-Synthe camp in Dunkirk, both of which have been demolished in the past nine months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unofficial camp photographed, which is said to have grown considerably in recent months, is dismantled by police on a weekly basis to prevent it becoming more permanent - a process which sometimes sees children get hurt, according to volunteers. In one case a three-year-old was reportedly seen with bruised face - allegedly caused by a baton while on another occasion, a mother was said to have told police that her baby was sleeping in a tent, only for officers to proceed to pepper spray the occupants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers said there were between 40 and 50 young children in the camp, which contains no proper toilets and relies on donations from volunteers for tents, food and adequate clothing. Heather Young, a volunteer with Paris Refugee Ground Support who was in the camp photographed earlier this week, said she saw &quot;dozens&quot; of babies and toddlers living in the woodland along with their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are dozens of young children, around 20 babies and toddlers, sleeping rough. There are also pregnant women and grandparents sleeping in tents,&quot; she told The Independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's horrific, unbearable. How anyone can live in woods pregnant? How do you have a one-month-old baby in a tent? How do you manage that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Refugee Ground Support's Ms Young, who has been working with refugees in France since last year, said the families in the unofficial camps tended to be the same ones &quot;again and again&quot;, although there is also a number of new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the fire in the Grande-Synthe camp in April, families were temporarily held in local sports halls, and then bussed out to accommodation centres across France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have since returned to the region with hopes of getting to the UK following a &quot;hostile&quot; reception from French authorities, volunteers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isis Mera, founder of grassroots organisation Help4Refugee Children, who took the photographs, said the refugees had become &quot;much more visible&quot; in Calais and Dunkirk in the past few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said &quot;abuse and antagonism&quot; by authorities towards refugees across France was driving them back to the northern region to pursue dangerous journeys to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mera added that one family living in the woodland - a husband and wife with an eight-month-old daughter - are intent on reaching the UK illegally after being &quot;abused racially&quot; in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had been moved to an accommodation centre after the demolition of the Jungle where the mother and baby had to share a bathroom with men. There, Ms Mera said, they received abuse and antagonism from local people. For this reason, they decided to return. Ms Young added that while previously, following the demolition of the two main camps, refugees had remained largely &quot;hidden&quot;, the numbers are now growing so quickly that people are becoming far more visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some remain hidden in the unofficial camps, but others are just sitting in the road. There are so many people now. How can you remain constantly hidden?&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless the French and British authorities find a viable solution, this will just continue and get worse again. These people are resilient. They're used to it now. It's horrific that you get used to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as a report by charity Help Refuges seen exclusively by The Independent reveals that due to the current policies implemented by the French authorities that result in an unwelcoming environment in Calais, children face significant risk to their health and safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These risks are exacerbated by a lack of shelter, food insecurity, lack of personal hygiene, lack of safety and a lack of community, social security and a sense of normality - the report warns that children are being failed by both the French and UK authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When approached for comment, a spokesperson for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region told The Independent: &quot;In the context of child welfare, shelter is systematically offered to minors in connection with the organisation France Terre d'Asile.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a refreshing change from the festive season's usual roster of drinks parties with the same friends, on Tuesday night I had dinner at Second Home's Spitalfields co-working space with a group of strangers. At the event, hosted by Help Refugees and Welcome Kitchen, hackers and other staff from the tech start-ups based there gathered for dinner with refugees. Chefs who have recently moved here from camps in Calais made a feast and the idea was to sit down together and meet new people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the refugees' first experiences of London have been detention centres and aggressive interrogations so this was a positive contrast, with jokes about learning the British art of queuing as we lined up at the buffet to pile our plates with Libyan stew and harissa that even the chef admitted was powerfully spicy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's open to anyone - it's free for refugees, &pound;40 for guests - and at past events connections have been made that have transformed lives. A London architect met a man who used to be an architect in Syria and gave him work, while another Syrian man told me he was cast in Bohemian Rhapsody, the new film about Queen, through friends he met at Welcome Kitchen and added on Facebook (Facebook is an indispensable resource for refugees building networks from scratch in a foreign country).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I went to Calais last year, the makeshift restaurants were hives of activity. People who had lost everything found a welcome distraction in cooking, taking pride in recreating national dishes and caring for new friends by feeding them. A HelpRefugees volunteer, wearing a Choose Love T-shirt designed by Katharine Hamnett, told me she was in Calais last week - this time of year is hard, she said, with around a thousand people living there, including boys as young as nine and clashes with police trying to move illegal camps. Those who escaped are trying to learn English and build new lives. Sharing a meal feels like the place to start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pop phenomenon to people's poet? Just let it go, Taylor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It looks like Taylor Swift has been watching Frozen. Her new poem, written to accompany her first British Vogue cover, sounds like it's been inspired by the Disney film's anthem Let it Go. According to Swift's poem, The Trick to Holding On, you need to &quot;let go&quot;. Apart from when it's something you should hold on to - keep up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poet friend called Swift's efforts &quot;mindfulness masquerading as poetry&quot;. In her role as pop star turned guru, Swift advises guarding &quot;your blazing self-respect&quot;, an idea that will chime across the confidence-obsessed Instagram accounts of Generation Y. Confusingly, she also refers to &quot;phone numbers you know by heart&quot;; surely that's all been outsourced to smartphones now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another poet was more charitable. He approved of the &quot;hedge-maze life&quot; metaphor (he wondered whether Swift meant she was the hedge and, if so, how can she escape it? Nightmare) and detected the influence of Emily Dickinson's ballad After great pain, a formal feeling comes, which also ends with &quot;letting go&quot;. This friend is better read than I am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swift, who prizes control over her public image, wrote the poem instead of doing an interview. Do journalists really have such a bad reputation that it's preferable to trot out a poem? Next time, T Swift, I'd be happy to talk it out of you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Momentum, the great party killer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hard Left is putting a dampener on Christmas parties. There's no vibe killer like someone you considered to be a like-minded friend assuming that everyone backs Momentum's takeover of Haringey council. We had it with Brexit - some families are still not on speaking terms because of feuds around EU tariffs - and now London is riven again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tenacious types refuse to let debate be stifled. They incorporate swotting up on political blogs into their getting-ready-for-parties routine to arrive armed with informed arguments. They don't mind if they're cast out from WhatsApp groups, because they stood up for their beliefs. The less brave have had to become adept at changing the subject; asking Momentum mates what they make of animojis usually does the trick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Go easy on that advent calendar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've already seen off two advent calendars. At least I shared them, unlike a friend who hacks advent by opening up the whole calendar box to devour in one swoop. Whatever happened to edging it, eking out the pleasure of one chocolate each day? At the risk of sounding old, the advent calendars of my childhood were sugar-free - behind each window was an illustration telling the nativity story, and that was enough of a thrill. Somewhere along the line, instant gratification has replaced self-control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excerpt from report by right-of-centre German newspaper Die Welt website on 10 November</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Report by Florian Flade: &quot;Frustrated, Traumatised, Radicalised.&quot; First paragraph is a Die Welt introduction.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security agencies constantly receive leads pointing to alleged terrorists among refugees. Three groups are of particular interest to investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[passage omitted]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A particularly disturbing situation, in the view of the security agencies: Those arriving as refugees have been shown to include not merely the victims of civil wars, but also perpetrators, such as Islamist terrorists - albeit in extremely small numbers. Identifying them is now proving to be a veritably Sisyphean task, which is likely to keep the police and intelligence services busy for many years yet. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [homeland intelligence agency] now has a working group bearing the name of &quot;Keto,&quot; responsible for systematically dealing with the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past few years, the constitutional protection service has received more than 2,000 leads regarding the presence of jihadists among refugees. Many of these tip-offs come from other refugees, and often amount to denunciations, or else deliberate smears. A case in point was the vilification, motivated by frustration and rage, of a fellow-resident in an asylum-seekers' hostel, as a fighter for the &quot;Islamic State&quot; [&quot;of Iraq and the Levant&quot;] terrorist militia. Such defamations are said to have become rarer recently. Though the vast majority of tip-offs continue to derive from other refugees, the information is now far less &quot;valuable,&quot; as constitutional protection service officials put it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three risk groups form the prime focus of the investigators' attention. The first group consists of extremists, infiltrated into Europe under the guise of refugees from civil wars, and tasked with the specific mission of carrying out attacks here, such as those perpetrated in Paris and Brussels. The precise number of jihadists actually smuggled into Europe in this way by IS is unclear. Around 20 of such &quot;sleepers&quot; are thought to have already been unmasked, according to security sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now, three young Syrians are on trial in Hamburg; according to the indictment, they were sent to Germany, and entered the country equipped with forged passports and a large quantity of cash. Installed on their cellphones were encrypted instant messaging programmes, allegedly enabling them to communicate with their IS handlers. In addition, a jihadist behind bars in Lebanon claims to have seen at least one of the Syrians in an IS bolthole for suicide bombers in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its &quot;Galaxy&quot; investigation, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has spent months examining the case against the three refugees, who were sheltered in the state of Schleswig-Holstein. They devoted hours of surveillance to them, prior to arresting the three in September 2016. Up to now, though actual evidence that the three were indeed planning to carry out an attack remains lacking. It is still no more than a hunch on the investigators' part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second group preoccupying the security agencies and the judiciary consists of those refugees who were active as jihadists before they came to Germany. In other words, they have a terrorist past. Though they are not necessarily regarded as posing a danger, this country's authorities do also prosecute these ex-terrorists on account of their criminal actions in the past, on charges up to and including war crimes. A wide range of investigative processes are now being devoted to such jihadist veterans, who purport to be innocent victims of war on entering Germany. or when their asylum applications are examined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such case is Abdul Beset al-O., who was arrested in Wuppertal in November 2016. His terror resume was revealed purely by chance. In November 2016, an Iraqi woman mentioned her violent husband in the course of her asylum application proceedings in Moenchengladbach. He beat her and ill-treated her extremely viciously, she reported. By the way, he had also been the commander of the IS terror militia, she added. The authorities promptly arranged accommodation for her in a women's refuge, and began to target her husband, who was living in Wuppertal. Iraqi Abdul Beset al-O. had entered Germany at the beginning of 2016, and had then applied for asylum. The investigations by the Federal and State Criminal Police Offices in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia revealed that Al-O. had apparently been the leader of a ten-man IS unit in Iraq, which had planned killings and abductions. According to a secret assessment by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Al-O. had even been trained for the purpose of &quot;perpetration of an attack in Germany.&quot; Without the tip-off from his former wife, the Iraqi would probably not have been discovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third group primarily comprises young refugees, who originally lacked any link to terrorism, but who became radicalised in Germany. This often happened in a very short time, for example through contacts that they made in Islamist mosque congregations, via contacts on social networks, or through extremist hate preachers. Riaz A., a 17-year old Afghan who attacked several people with an axe on a regional train in the state of Bavaria in July 2016, is an example of this category. Another is a 16-year old Syrian, whom investigators arrested in a refugee hostel in Cologne in September 2016. He had procured bottles of butane gas, batteries, and sewing needles, probably for the purpose of manufacturing an explosive device. An investigator later testified in court that the young man had become &quot;turboradicalised&quot; within a space of three months: A state of affairs which state protection agencies find disturbing, with an eye to the future. &quot;The danger arises that young people who have failed to find any connection or foothold here will drift into extremism,&quot; warns a state protection officer. The traumatization and the psychological problems of many young refugees need to be addressed more intensively, he warns, adding that: &quot;Frustration can very rapidly turn into hatred. And then things can get dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers must maintain lone child refugees' right to be reunited with extended family in Britain after Brexit or they could be left stranded abroad at greater risk of sexual abuse and trafficking, MPs have warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They spoke after leaked Government proposals for post-Brexit immigration policy said the European Union rules will no longer apply after Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ``Dublin III'' regulations go further than UK law as they allow children fleeing war and persecution to be reunited with grandparents, uncles and aunts, siblings, and other family members, as opposed to just their parents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office document, leaked to The Guardian, confirmed that the rules as they currently apply to the UK ``will not continue'' but said ministers were ``ready to discuss'' responsibility for asylum claims with Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal Democrat former minister Norman Lamb said children who are alone in Europe would be at greater risk of exploitation unless the Government commits to continuing the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lamb also urged the Government to go further and extend the rights globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was backed by Labour MP Andy Slaughter, who said this would help bring down the number of child refugees making dangerous and sometimes fatal journeys to EU countries to gain the right to reunification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their call follows claims that the Government has let down child refugees by closing the Dubs scheme, which required the UK to resettle an unspecified number of unaccompanied minors from Europe, after 480 were brought to the UK - well below the 3,000 campaigners had demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Dublin III process has faced criticism for being too slow, Mr Lamb said it was important to get the legal position right for child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the Press Association: ``If you've got an orphan, someone whose parents who have both died in conflict, who is stuck in Calais or whatever, and there's an uncle and aunt living somewhere in the UK, Dublin III covers them, but the UK's own immigration rules don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I want to see a commitment to maintain the rights that those children currently have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I don't think there can be any possible justification for reducing the rights of unaccompanied children given all of the dangers that they face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``And I think that the inevitable consequence of a diminution of their rights is a great likelihood of exploitation, sexual abuse, violence, and everything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``There's a clear and stark choice for the Government here and I hope very much that they do the right thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Slaughter said extending these rights across the world would help save children's lives and cut down on dangerous trafficking across the Mediterranean, a stated Government aim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``If you are in Libya or Turkey or wherever then you can't (get the right to reunification), therefore you get kids losing their lives crossing the Mediterranean which the Government says it doesn't want to happen,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Slaughter said he thought it was unlikely that the Government would back the idea, given the ``punitive'' nature of the leaked immigration proposals, which ministers have stressed have not been finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labour MP said: ``Clearly, from what came out this morning the line is going to be very tough in terms of - they're not giving way even on things like students or necessarily foreign workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``So the idea that they're actually going to change the laws to make it essentially a broader group of people getting asylum and refugee status seems to me bizarre.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lily Caprani, of Unicef UK, said: ``The UK will need a new set of rules for refugee family reunion as it exits the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It's critical that Brexit doesn't put at risk the ability of children fleeing war and persecution to reach the safety of their close family in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Now is the time for the UK Government to broaden its own rules and ensure the protection of unaccompanied refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This means simply widening the definition of family to allow children to be reunited with siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles, as well as their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This will not take complex negotiations with the EU, it's simply a matter of the Home Office changing its own rules.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens are demanding Australia immediately accept 20,000 Muslim refugees from Myanmar as the violent humanitarian crisis worsens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party leader Richard Di Natale has written to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull insisting Australia issue emergency humanitarian visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His call comes as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates 300,000 ethnic minority Rohingyas have fled Myanmar since a military crackdown began on August 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have written to the prime minister over the crisis in Myanmar and the unprecedented levels of forcible displacement we are seeing,' he told his 71,700 Facebook followers on Monday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excerpt from report by electronic edition of popular German tabloid newspaper Bild on 2 September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Interview with SPD candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz, answering questions by Bild readers; place and date not given: &quot;I Can Still Turn Around the Election&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With three weeks to go until the election [federal election in Germany], [SPD Social Democratic Party of Germany) candidate for chancellor] Martin Schulz answers questions from readers of [the German daily tabloid] Bild.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[passage omitted]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Daniela H.] Mr. Schulz, why was there such a hype about you at the beginning, but then, all of a sudden, your ratings dropped sharply?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] This was because of the people's high expectations! At the beginning of the year, it became evident, also in polls, that the people wished for an alternative to [Federal Chancellor] Angela Merkel. And suddenly, many people saw that there was an alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the SPD has suffered quite a few defeats, some were its own fault, others happened through no fault of its own, for example, the switch of a Greens deputy to the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] in Lower Saxony, which resulted in the loss of government majority. This was not my fault, but of course, it is being interpreted as negative for me. And we lost two state elections, one in North Rhine- Westphalia, which is a very, very serious defeat for the SPD. Yet, 46 per cent of the voters are still undecided. Therefore, I think that it is still possible to turn around the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] In other words, you are familiar with quick ups and downs. This takes us to a topical issue, the return of [former German Defence Minister] Karl- Theodor zu Guttenberg. What do you think about his political comeback?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] It is interesting. In my view, Mr. von und zu Guttenberg has always been a dazzling and interesting person. I think that, in the current situation, it was a tactical move of [Bavarian Minister- President] Horst Seehofer to win him over in order to prevent Markus Soeder (Bavarian Finance Minister, editors' note) as successor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] Would Guttenberg be an asset for our political landscape?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] I do not know. There is certainly no eternal damnation in politics. This applies also to Mr. von und zu Guttenberg. Radical conservative voters will certainly regard him as an asset, a social democrat probably will not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] Let us consider the television debate with Angela Merkel on Sunday [3 September]. How nervous are you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] I am not nervous at all. It will be the first, and unfortunately also the only occasion for me and the current Federal Chancellor to meet for a debate. Angela Merkel is avoiding this, and she tried to dictate conditions that are more favourable for her. But I am not nervous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] Can you attack Angela Merkel by focusing on the refugee issue? After all, this is a topic of major interest to our readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] Refugee policy is and will remain an important issue. Just remember, all the time, I pointed out the importance of the refugee issue over and over again. I travelled to Italy to see for myself, and I was fiercely criticized for this from the CDU, which is a sign that they have no kind of master plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Merkel is now occupying herself with the issue again, which, in my opinion, she should have done earlier. In an interview with [the German Sunday paper] Bild am Sonntag, she said that, today, she would do everything the same way as she did in 2015. I think that there is one mistake that Ms. Merkel made in 2015, which she should not repeat, namely, not integrating the European partners beforehand, but informing them only afterward, which until today allows Poland and Hungary to shirk responsibility, justifying their behaviour by saying that they were not asked; hence, it was none of their business; it was a German problem. By the way, [Hungarian Prime Minister] Victor Orban, a good friend of Mr. Seehofer, is even asking money for the border fence that he is erecting right now. That is a bit thick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] Let us ask once again: in concrete terms, what would you do as a chancellor if we were once again faced with a similar refugee stream as that in 2015? Would you keep the borders open, as Angela Merkel did, or would you close them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] Above all, I would do one thing: I would tell the European partners that Germany, Italy, and Greece alone can admit all refugees. Either the refugees are distributed in solidarity among all member countries, or Germany will call the EU budget into question. It is unacceptable to finance people who sit back at home and raise their arm against Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] It will probably be the so-called &quot;ordinary&quot; people who have to integrate the refugees in their residential areas, their schools, and their perhaps low-skilled job environments. Can you understand that these people are afraid of losing something?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] Of course, I perfectly understand them. This is why the distribution of refugees is a task for society as a whole. We cannot simply say, &quot;We will manage!&quot; and not provide the necessary funds to the people who actually do the job. By the way, what was accomplished in Germany is not the achievement of the Federal Chancellor, but that of hundreds of thousands of people who helped, apart from their job, apart from their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] But what would you do in concrete terms to take away the people's feeling, whether justified or not, of losing something because the government is doing so much for the refugees?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] First of all, I would not make such an assertion because, very often, it is not true. The people have this feeling, but in reality, they will not lose anything. The best way to control such feelings is, first, to openly discuss them and, second, not to burden even more the quarters that already carry the major burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, it is nice to live in an exclusive residential area, mulling over the need to change the world. If no refugees arrive, all the better. But in large conurbations, where cheap apartments are requisitioned to accommodate refugees, tensions will rise. Therefore, I think that integration has also to do with involving the entire society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[passage omitted]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Manfred Frings] You often speak about social equality. Where is it? Just look at the young people. Who should pay their pensions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] Mr. Frings is absolutely right. This is precisely the biggest difference between Ms. Merkel and me in domestic policy: Ms. Merkel says that there is no need to intervene in the pension system. I have a completely different view. It is a major challenge to do something for the generation of Mr. Fring's children and grandchildren. If we do not intervene, the pension level will drop and the contributions will rise. At this point, the CDU says: well, then you need to work until age 70. This is unacceptable. We will change this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] However, it is not quite alright to consider only the statutory pension. Most retired people have additional incomes, which can be seen from the high household incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] But this is not true for many women who worked in part-time jobs. This is not true for many single parents. And this is certainly not true for the low-wage sector, which has grown in the past few years. These people will retire someday, and then, we will have the problem of old-age poverty, especially of women. Therefore it is urgently necessary to intervene here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] Your SPD pension concept says that the pension level should be kept at 48 per cent of the average wage and that it should not be lowered to 43 per cent. A study says that this will be detrimental to young people born 1995 and later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] But this is not true. It will not be detrimental to them. We want to stabilise the contribution rate until the middle of the coming decade before it will start to rise moderately. Above all, we want to stabilise the pension entry age at 67. In addition, I would like to point out that we want to conclude the new intergenerational contract in the next legislative period because we need to discuss two fundamental questions that have not been considered at all in this study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, can we integrate additional groups of people as contributors to the pension insurance scheme, for example solo self-employed, whose number is growing, and who have no retirement security at all? Second point: is it possible to reduce the burden on the so-called extraneous insurance benefits? Just take, for example, the mothers' pension. I am a strong advocate of the mothers' pension, but no contributions have been paid into the insurance scheme for this. Hence, it is a task for society as a whole. And the question is whether this needs to be financed from taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] Do these political debates not unnecessarily fuel uncertainty among pensioners, who are really not poor at present?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] This is Merkel's way of avoiding discussions so as not to upset people. By not addressing issues, but delaying them until kingdom come, you will not upset the people, that is true, but someday, you will drive them into a very difficult situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me tell you what the idea of the CDU is: pensions are decreasing? OK, that is a fact. The contributions are rising? OK, that is a fact; anyway, this is the legal situation. Well, we will have to work until age 70. Then, a young geriatric nurse in her early 40s, for example, will be part of the generation that has to pay higher and higher contributions, but in the end, she will receive the lowest pension in history. And on top of that, at the age of 70, she will have to nurse an 80-year-old patient. We will not support this kind of pension concept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[passage omitted]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] Are you in favour of a policy of detente towards Russia and a better relationship with [Russian President] Putin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] Yes I am. But it always takes two to achieve a peaceful reconciliation. We cannot ignore the fact that the government of Putin pursues an expansive policy, a partially very aggressive foreign policy. I think that the United Nations is and will remain key to secure peace in the world. Veto-holding members of the UN Security Council have a special duty to contribute to world peace. The annexation of the Crimea peninsula by the Russian Federation, a veto-holding nation, was a massive breach of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Syria, there are incidents that are absolutely unacceptable, but a Security Council member is responsible for them. What I want to say is that I am in favour of seeking compromise with Russia. But I am also in favour of talking straight with Russia. I think that we should make offers to Russia. But this only makes sense if Russia is willing to accept them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] We noticed that, on Twitter, you mostly, actually exclusively, criticise US President Donald Trump, but never Vladimir Putin. Why is that so, considering the sharp words you have just said?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] This is not true. I also criticise Vladimir Putin, perhaps not on Twitter. But as a long-serving observer of the Brussels scene, you will know that, when I was President of the European Parliament, I reduced the access of the Russian Embassy staff to the European Parliament - to the Ambassador and his assistant - which, by the way, Russia described as a breach of international diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] You said that, as a chancellor, you would try to make offers but at the same time adopt a very harsh position. This reminds us of a time when people said: we make an offer to the Soviet Union, but we also take measures to deter the regime. Is it necessary again to play a double game?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] What we certainly do not need is a unilateral arms race that is spiralling upward, as Donald Trump - or perhaps also Vladimir Putin - is seeking. What we, the Europeans, need is a reminiscence of the great men and women of the 1970s and 1980s, who said: both must be possible: we should not only unilaterally talk about armament, but at least also test options whether arms limitation or disarmament is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Bild] What would be your basic idea, as a chancellor, to address such an issue? Do you regard Vladimir Putin and the current Russian leadership as opponents or partners?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Schulz] That is difficult to tell: in its current foreign policy, Russia rather acts at its discretion: sometimes as a partner, and sometimes as an opponent. There is no coherent line. They very much act on the discretionary principle: if it is beneficial, we are partners. If it is not, we are opponents. We need to adapt to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, the problem of the Europeans is that we do not have a uniform line at present. And therefore, my first task as Federal Chancellor would be to gather the four G-7 countries, the United Kingdom, France - two nuclear-armed veto-holding countries - plus Italy and Germany, and to say: let us try once again, perhaps within the framework of the OSCE, to develop a joint European position in order to convince, in the end, the nuclear superpowers - the Russian Federation on the one hand, and the United States of America on the other - to join us at the negotiating table.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union  announced Thursday that it is taking the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to court for failing to accommodate their fair share of refugees under a plan agreed to by the 28-country bloc two years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU nations agreed in Sept. 2015 to relocate 160,000 refugees from Italy  and Greece  as the countries buckled under the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants  that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the plan, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic were supposed to take in a combined 10,000 people.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Hungary and Poland have taken none at all, while the Czech Republic has accepted 12. The EU's executive Commission sought reasons why but was given no satisfactory explanations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission said Thursday that the three &quot;remain in breach of their legal obligations&quot; and &quot;have given no indication that they will contribute to the implementation of the relocation decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their cases are being referred to Europe's top tribunal, the Court of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee relocation plan was adopted in a legally-binding vote by a majority of EU member states, but not the three refusing to take part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan never worked well. As of last week, only around 32,000 refugees had been relocated in all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute has highlighted the deep divisions among Europeans over how best to handle the migrant wave, which saw more than 1 million people enter Europe in 2015, mostly from Turkey to the Greek islands and across the Mediterranean to Italy. It has also undermined trust among EU partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission's second in command, Vice-President Frans Timmermans, said he did his utmost to avoid legal action and that the three could still do something about it as a few thousand people in the Greek islands remain eligible to be distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Going to court is always the instrument of last resort. That's not what we want,&quot; he said. &quot;We hope we still find a way out through an act of participation by these three countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Poland is intransigent. Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said the government was not changing its policy on migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing has changed. Our position is clear: we do not agree with the solution that the European Union proposed two years ago,&quot; he told reporters Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Czech Republic seemed more conciliatory, with newly appointed Prime Minister Andrej Babis told the local CTK news agency that he wants to negotiate with the Commission to get the legal action lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate move, the Commission also referred Hungary to the Court of Justice over two other laws, one on higher education and the other on non-governmental institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both cases, Hungary has failed to address EU concerns about the laws or amend the legislation to bring it in line with EU standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the core of both laws are the Hungarian government's efforts to curtail the influence of Hungarian-American financier George Soros in Hungary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Viktor Orban considers Soros a key political foe, mainly because of their diverging views on migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law on nonprofits compels civic groups getting more than around $27,000 a year in funding from abroad to register themselves with a court and identify themselves as being &quot;foreign-funded&quot; on their websites and all publications. Many NGOs hit by the new law are partially funded by Soros.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Hussain was detained by Home Office officials in Dunkirk for several hours last year before he concealed himself around the wheel area of a lorry heading from France to the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Errors in Home office paperwork about Mohammed that &quot;should have been picked up&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; No signature on the paperwork to detain him, therefore he was unlawfully detained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; No information about his rights given apart from contact details for two legal advice services, both of which had closed down several years before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed was held in UK detention for four hours and after he was released he managed to smuggle himself onto the lorry bound for the UK. When the lorry stopped in Banbury, Oxfordshire, and reversed in the early hours of 1 April 2016, he was fatally crushed under the wheels. He had hidden himself above the lorry wheel for at least three hours enduring enormous discomfort and near freezing temperatures in the hours before his death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coroner identified &quot;non-compliance with existing procedures and arguable gaps&quot; in Home Office procedures in the controlled zone in northern France where they operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he agreed with the legal team for Mohammed's family that there was a element of &quot;don't ask&quot; among Home Office officials in France when dealing with unaccompanied child refugees &quot;because this will lead to a requirement for more to be done&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recommended that children should be provided with written information about their rights and that this information should be available in a variety of languages, that appropriate training should be given to Home Office officials in dealing with unaccompanied children and that child detention that has not been properly authorised should not happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed had been living in Sulaymaniyah in northern Iraq with his parents and brother when he decided to try to get to the UK. His plan was to get refugee status in the UK and then bring his parents and brother to safety. He didn't tell his parents what he was doing as he knew they would try to prevent him making the dangerous journey across Europe. Instead he told them he was going to Turkey for a visit and crossed Europe, spending six months in a refugee camp in Dunkirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hoped to join his uncle Shamal Bakr Salih, a refugee living and working in a bakery in Manchester, who had undertaken to look after him. He had a right to family reunion under Dublin lll regulations but Home Office officials did not explore this with him when he was detained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He thought the best way to save his family was to get to the UK and then bring them here,&quot; said Salih.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was an appalling and traumatic experience for our family. I felt deep pain and grief for months. I still cry when I talk about him. Mohammed's family have been destroyed by what has happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We as a family are also concerned about the number of children that are risking their lives in the way Mohammed did. We do not want any other unaccompanied minor to die in the way that Mohammed did. He was a good and kind boy. His body was flown back to Iraq for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drinkal said: &quot;There are things that have come from this particular case that have changed things. Operational practices on the ground will be changing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coroner concluded that Mohammed died as a result of an accident. The charity Safe Passage has offered support to Mohammed's family and has launched a petition calling for family reunion rights for children like Mohammed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Gabriel of Safe Passage said: &quot;As the numbers arriving in Calais start to grow again we hope this inquest will underline the urgent need for government to open this legal pathway, rather than forcing more children onto the backs of lorries and over the barbed wire onto high speed trains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jane Ryan, of Bhatt Murphy, the family's solicitors, said: &quot;Mohammed's death could have been prevented. He had a right to have his application to join his uncle in the UK to have been considered under Dublin lll but this never happened.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus Island detention centre has officially closed but more than 600 men are still refusing to leave, saying they fear for their lives in the Papua New Guinean community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has also supported claims by observers that community accommodation for detainees is not ready, refuting assurances given by the Australian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electricity was shut off to the final compounds on Wednesday morning, more than 12 hours after the scheduled 5pm shutdown, and the generator was removed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food, water and other essential services had already been stopped, and all staff left early on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journalist and refugee Behrouz Boochani said detainees were keeping watch through the night, fearful of attacks by locals or attempts by authorities to forcibly remove them. They had stockpiled water in bins and some food, and obtained solar chargers for their phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday afternoon, Boochani reported one detainee had self-harmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said security and immigration staff had spoken with detainees and confirmed no services would be provided to them but multiple sources have also reported officials do not intend to use force to remove people today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A refugee has harmed himself with a razor. He cut his wrist and chest. Physically he's good now but mentally is out of control- Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 1, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday Papua New Guinea's largest newspaper, the Post-Courier, declared Australia had &quot; literally abandoned Manus Island &quot;, sparking chaos and confusion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some services - like the health provider International Health and Medical Services - are expected to stay on the island but it is not known how long for or who is funding them. The PNG government has said all refugees and asylum seekers who won't settle in PNG are Australia's obligation. Australia has not responded with any clarification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nat Jit Lam, regional representative for the UNHCR and speaking from Lorengau, said the purpose-built community accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers was not ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR had inspected two of the three units, including the newly built West Lorengau site. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was still major earthworks in progress,&quot; he told ABC radio. &quot;There was heavy machinery on the ground as well, fences still being constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't look like it's ready. I'm not an expert on engineering but, as a UNHCR officer who's been working with refugees, I would not be bringing any refugees to stay there, not in that state. It's not ready at this moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting prime minister, Julie Bishop had said there was a &quot;great deal of information&quot; about the closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My response to Peter Dutton is that he is a racist, a proven liar, a fascist, and a proven human rights abuser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nick McKim, Greens senator    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The essential services are available at the alternative accommodation - food, water, electricity, medical support,&quot; she told ABC radio on Wednesday morning. &quot;People on Manus have had months of notice ... It makes no sense for them to stay where they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She would not be drawn on the PNG government's declaration that it had fullfilled its obligations and remaining detainees were Australia's responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a tough policy and we are sending a very strong message that we will not tolerate people smuggling trying to get people into Australia illegally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens senator Nick McKim, who is on Manus Island, said the 600 former detainees who remain at the decommissioned immigration detention centre feared for their lives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detainees were told they faced &quot;removal from an active PNG military base&quot; if they refused to leave the detention centre but have repeatedly said they fear for their safety in the PNG community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by Human Rights Watch detailed increasing violent attacks on refugees and asylum seekers, three which required medical transfers to Port Moresby or Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday there were multiple separate allegations of Manus residents looting the centre. There was also a protest outside the gates demanding that Australia take the refugees and not leave them to live in Manus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Manus Island detainees fear for safety after police squads armed 'like it's a war'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKim told the Guardian that Dutton was &quot;bullshitting&quot; about the readiness of accommodation and that he had since learned there was a shortage of about 150 beds in the new units. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So even if all the guys came out today there would be 150-plus of them who would be left on the side of the road in Lorengau, where there have been brutal attacks,&quot; he said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKim had been attempting to re-enter the detention centre but he was told to leave by immigration officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They gave us five minutes' warning so I could have a bit of a chat to some of the guys through the fence,&quot; he said. &quot;Not a lot has changed since yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He repeated claims many detainees were suffering withdrawals from the loss of psychotropic medication, which had been cut off when Australian staff left the centre, and were at risk of becoming &quot;acutely suicidal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday night McKim told ABC Lateline Dutton was a liar, a racist and a &quot;monster&quot;, after Dutton accused him of misleading detainees for his own political purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My response to Peter Dutton is that he is a racist, a proven liar, a fascist, and a proven human rights abuser,&quot; McKim said. &quot;It's a badge of honour to be personally attacked by Peter Dutton and I'm just taking it as confirmation that I'm on the right track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm actually the one here on the ground. I've seen the photos taken yesterday of that facility and it is not ready and I'm prepared to stake my political credibility any time against the credibility of a monster like Peter Dutton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKim said he had not toured the new accommodation facilities himself because that would be trespassing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens leader, Richard Di Natalie, defended his senator's comments on Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Dutton has behaved in a way that's absolutely racist, it's abhorrent,&quot; Di Natale told Radio National. &quot;He has washed his hands of any responsibility to these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian Council for International Development conference passed a motion on Wednesday calling on the Turnbull government to bring the men to Australia and &quot;end their suffering&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time last year, as the Calais camp was&nbsp;razed to the ground, the Home Secretary announced the UK would take a leading role in protecting children caught up in the demolition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, this country helped secure the transfer of over 550 unaccompanied children to their family here in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a welcome and compassionate step by the Home Secretary and a move only made possible by our membership of the EU's Dublin III Regulation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Brexit means&nbsp;this legal right to safety will soon come to an end. This piece of&nbsp;EU legislation meant those children could reach their family; their parents, grandparents, aunts,&nbsp;uncles, or adult siblings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the UK's own refugee family reunion rules do not currently&nbsp;recognise family in the same way, defining a refugee child's family as only their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Government knows&nbsp;Brexit must not slam the&nbsp;door shut&nbsp;on our relationship with our&nbsp;European neighbours, it must not close down&nbsp;safe and&nbsp;legal routes&nbsp;for refugee children either.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many&nbsp;people accept Brexit will mean new rules on how people come to our country, I suspect few believe it should force some of the world's most vulnerable children to make dangerous journeys with people smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor would they want these children&nbsp;to head to&nbsp;Calais, Dunkirk or Bilbao in order to reach the safety of their family in the UK.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Unicef UK has warned, there are children still in Afghanistan whose homes are lost and embark on a long dangerous journey in search of sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are still&nbsp;children whose parents have been killed in the brutal Syrian war looking for a route out. For those children with family in the UK, family reunion is their best hope to find safety, and their best hope to find a home.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was recognised by David Davis, the Brexit minister, in Parliament&nbsp;just two weeks ago. He said: &quot;we are a country with a strong tradition of tolerance and generosity, and if anything, I expect that to grow after we leave, not diminish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the right position for us&nbsp;to take and a welcome statement, but so far we've seen no detail on how we intend to fill the legislative&nbsp;gap when we leave the EU. Children dodging shrapnel need us to build on his&nbsp;words. They need their family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children review manuals distributed by UNICEF-supported volunteers on the risks of unexploded remnants of warCredit:      Sebastian Rich/UNICEF     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month&nbsp;Parliament started debating the EU Withdrawal Bill - the so-called Great Repeal Bill - which is set to transpose EU Regulations into UK law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this mean the&nbsp;Dublin III Regulations will automatically become the UK's regulations? Our generosity as a nation and sense of global partner would be reaffirmed if we had&nbsp;clarification on this. The Immigration Bill is some way away, but the refugee crisis remains ever present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By expanding our family reunion rules so that&nbsp;refugee children can apply from source countries to be with their family in the UK, managed by our own embassies and consulates, we can really start to take forward our vision for &nbsp;a&nbsp;'Global Britain'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why Unicef UK's report today on keeping refugee families together is so important. Right now a child is trafficked or exploited every 30 minutes taking the central Mediterranean route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If legislative clarification can stop even&nbsp;just a few hundred children making&nbsp;those unnecessary journeys, then it's a change worth making.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fixing this through our own rules is simple - it doesn't require complex European negotiations. It&nbsp;just needs&nbsp;a decision by the Government to extend Dublin III into our own legislation so&nbsp;children can escape war and reach the safety of their family. Let Brexit help them&nbsp;take back control of their futures too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 410,000 members of the country's Rohingya Muslim minority face shortages of food, water, and shelter after escaping from western Rakhine state into Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have fled a Burmese military offensive that the United Nations has branded &quot;a textbook example of ethnic cleansing&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people are arriving hungry, exhausted and with no food or water,&quot; said Mark Pierce, Bangladesh country director the Save the Childrencharity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added:&quot;I'm particularly worried that the demand for food, shelter, water and basic hygiene support is not being met due to the sheer number of people in need. If families can't meet their basic needs, the suffering will get even worse and lives could be lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For decades Bangladesh has received influxes of Rohingya fleeing from Buddhist-majority Burma, where they are reviled by many as illegal immigrants and suffer systematicdiscrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya before the latest crisis erupted last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's government has committed to building thousands of shelters to house displaced people, with the United Nations Refugee Agency warning existing camps were &quot;bursting at the seams&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pierce said the humanitarian response needed be urgently scaled up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya insurgents on police posts and an army camp, which killed a dozen people on 25 August.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Aung San Suu Kyi's &quot;last chance&quot; to halt a humanitarian catastrophe and&nbsp;save her reputation as a champion of human rights.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first public address since the outbreak of an apparent campaign&nbsp;of ethnic cleansing against Burma's Rohingya Muslim minority  three weeks ago, Ms Suu Kyi on Tuesday pledged her government's commitment to universal human rights  and&nbsp;promised diplomats access to Rakhine state to investigate the crisis.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics accused her of obfuscation, misleading statements, and ultimately&nbsp;failing to address&nbsp;the grim truth - that the army she nominally controls is conducting a brutal campaign of arson, rape, and murder .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are seven key lines from Ms Suu Kyi's speech that critics say will damage her reputation.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   1. '(Burma) does not fear international scrutiny'                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are interested in joining us in our endeavours, please let us know,&quot; Ms Suu Kyi told assembled diplomats. &quot;We can arrange for you to visit these areas, and to ask them for yourselves why [remaining Muslim residents] have not fled.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality, access to&nbsp;Rakhine state for journalists, diplomats, and aid workers has been severely restricted for months.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yanghee Lee, a UN special rapporteur for human rights,&nbsp;was denied access to parts of region for security reasons earlier this year and in June complained that official investigations into alleged military abuses were&nbsp;&quot;without a robust methodology or witness protection policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Roland Oliphant: The scale of the Rohingya crisis 'is mindblowing'       00:56</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Late August Ms&nbsp;Suu Kyi's office accused aid agencies of colluding with &quot;terrorists&quot; - forcing several aid agencies to curtail operations in Rakhine state out of fears for the safety of their staff.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'More than 50 percent of the villages of Muslims are intact - they are as they were before the attacks took place'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch reported on Monday that it had counted 214 villages almost totally destroyed in Rakhine state since August 25. The figure, based on analysis of new satellite images, amounts to the destruction of tens of thousands of homes. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN estimates at least 420,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh from Rakhine state in the past three weeks - nearly half of the estimated&nbsp;1.1 million Rohingya who live there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Children 'burned alive' say Rohingya refugees       01:48</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Myanmar Ministry of information claimed on Friday that 176 &nbsp;of 471 Rohingya villages had been abandoned and some had fled from another 34 villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Humanitarian aid reached all communities in 95 percent of affected areas before the recent attacks on August 25.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers speaking off the record say that UN and other agencies were forced to shut down all operations in Rakhine state after August 25, and the entire region was closed to relief operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya Muslim women stretch their arms out to collect sanitary products distributed by aid agencies near Balukhali refugee camp, BangladeshCredit:       Dar Yasin/AP     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some aid agencies remain in Sittwe, the regional capital, but have been effectively confined to barracks since Ms&nbsp;Suu Kyi's office said in a statement that aid workers were colluding with &quot;terrorists&quot; three weeks ago.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear whether access to the affected areas in the north of Rakhine state will be restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Since December 2016, local and foreign media groups have been given access to area previously off limits in Rakhine. Even after the outbreaks on the 25th of August we arrange for several media groups to visit the afflicted areas'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rakhine state is effectively closed to journalists operating independently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in September, one&nbsp;small group of journalists were taken on a tightly controlled tour accompanied by government minders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya refugees wait to be transported to Cox's Bazar after their arrival in Bangladesh on MondayCredit:      &nbsp;CATHAL MCNAUGHTON/ REUTERS     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC team on the tour reported being handed clearly faked photographs by government minders and speaking to transparently fake interviewees who claimed to have been burnt out of their homes by Rohingya militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the interviewees even showed up playing the role of a &quot;militant&quot; in the photographs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Those who have been verified as refugees from this country will be accepted without any problems and with full assurance of their security and access to humanitarian aid'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Suu Kyi referred specifically to &quot;principles&quot; agreed between Burma and Bangladesh following a previous exodus of Rohingya refugees in 1992 - 1993. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1993 agreement means refugees who can prove their residence in Burma with documents may return. But it says nothing about those who either did not possess such paperwork or were forced to flee before they were able to gather their documents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Matthew Smith (@matthewfsmith) September 19, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Suu Kyi's promise of safe return also appears to contradict an earlier statement from Burma's information ministry which accused refugees of complicity in terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who fled the villages made their way to the other country for fear of being arrested as they got involved in the violent attacks,&quot; the ministry said on Friday .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'There have been no conflicts since the 5th of September and no clearance operations'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights activists and journalists, including from the The Telegraph, have interviewed dozens if not hundreds of refugees who have reported on-going violence in Rakhine state almost daily for the past three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;table&gt;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Jonathan Miller (@millerC4) September 19, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you don't have to take the refugees' word for it. Smoke from burning villages - the result of so-called &quot;clearance operations&quot; - has been seen from the border almost everyday. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'There have been allegations and counter allegations. And we have to listen to all of them, and we have to make sure that these allegations are based on solid evidence'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Suu Kyi is right that there are contradictory allegations flying around. But there is no longer any doubt about the crimes being committed by the Burmese military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations, foreign governments,&nbsp; human rights groups, and independent journalists have reached the conclusion that the Burmese military and vigilante mobs are carrying out a campaign of arson, murder, rape, and eviction that amounts to ethnic cleansing &nbsp;of the&nbsp;Rohingya minority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That conclusion is supported by multiple consistent accounts provided by refugees; satellite imagery; and accounts from reporters allowed into Rakhine under strict government control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is also undisputed is that a previously little-known insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, carried out deadly attacks on Burmese security forces on August 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear whether the group has also carried out attacks on non-Rohingya civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no evidence to support claims by the army that Rohingya refugees have set fire to their own villages in a bid to incriminate the authorities - a tale they have tried to support with transparently faked photographs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that the humanitarian crisis that has resulted in displacement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas from Myanmar not only provides a &quot;breeding ground&quot; for radicalization, but also puts vulnerable people - including young children - at grave risk, United Nations Secretary-General called for &quot;swift action&quot; to prevent further instability and find a durable solution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation has spiralled into the world's fastest developing refugee emergency and a humanitarian and human rights nightmare,&quot; Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres said today at a Security Council meeting on the situation in Myanmar.<BR><BR>At least 500,000 civilians have fled their homes in the country's northern Rakhine state since late August and sought refuge in Bangladesh. According to estimates, some 94 per cent among them are members of the minority Muslim Rohingya community.<BR><BR>There have also been reports of burning of Muslim villages, as well as looting and acts of intimidation. Authorities in Myanmar have indicated that at least 176 of 471 Muslim villages in northern Rakhine have been totally abandoned.<BR><BR>&quot;We have received bone-chilling accounts from those who fled - mainly women, children and the elderly,&quot; added the UN chief, noting that testimonies pointed to serious violations of human rights, including indiscriminate firing of weapons, the presence of landmines and sexual violence.<BR><BR>&quot;This is unacceptable and must end immediately.&quot;<BR><BR><BR><BR>Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres briefs the Security Council meeting on the situation in Rahkine state of Myanmar, which has seen hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing to neighbouring Bangladesh over the last several weeks. UN Photo/Kim Haughton Failure to address the violence could result in a spill-over into central Rakhine - where an additional 250,000 Muslims could potentially face displacement - Mr. Guterres warned, stressing that Government must ensure the safety and security of all communities and uphold rule of law without discrimination. In his briefing, the Secretary-General also underscored that UN agencies and their non-governmental partners must be granted immediate and safe access to all affected communities. Speaking also on the need to ensure safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of the refugees to their areas of origin, Mr. Guterres noted that the 1993 Joint Statement of the Foreign Ministers of Bangladesh and Myanmar could be a useful starting point, but it is not sufficient in the present circumstances, in particular as it does not refer to resolving the root cause of displacement as well as because it requires documents that the refugee Rohingya may not be able to provide. &quot;Ensuring the safe, voluntary and dignified return of refugees to Rakhine - in line with international refugee law - will require the restoration of mutual trust among the communities,&quot; he said, noting that improved inter-communal relations forms a critical part of a sustainable solution to the crisis. Mt. Guterres further noted that the issue of protracted statelessness must be resolved. &quot;The Muslims of Rakhine state should be granted nationality,&quot; he stated, adding that while the present Myanmar citizenship legislation only allows it partially, an effective verification exercise should be conducted in the interim to allow those entitled be granted citizenship based on the present laws. &quot;All others must be able to obtain a legal status that allows them to lead a normal life, including freedom of movement and access to labour markets, education and health services,&quot; he added. In his remarks, the UN chief also spoke of a donor conference to be convened by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as well as noted efforts by regional actors to help address the crisis. &quot;I look forward to effective and credible follow-up to the authorities' stated commitment to greater access, including for the international community, the media and humanitarian actors,&quot; he said, noting: &quot;The regional cooperation with Myanmar will also be essential, and the United Nations fully stands behind this.&quot;<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amanullah Hassan had no official training before he became a teacher in a secret school in Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya villagers set it up for their community after authorities imposed an apartheid system blocking them from being educated with their Buddhist neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His second teaching job, in a refugee camp in Bangladesh, was also in a semi-secret school, a low-profile mud-walled building indistinguishable from the ordinary houses that surrounded it, inhabited by Rohingya refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first school built in Kutupalong camp in 2009 by the charity Children on the Edge was demolished by police and locals, who were angry that the refugees were receiving charity not given to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the introduction of an apartheid system in Burma's Rakhine state in 2012, Rohingya children were not allowed to learn their own language at school. They were taught Burmese and English but not Bengali, the formal language from which the Rohingya dialect is derived. &quot;It is ironic, given that the Burmese government's case is that these are Bengali invaders,&quot; John Littleton, from Children on the Edge, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when they set up their own schools, paid for by villagers, teachers such as Mr Hassan, 21, did not dare teach Bengali. Now Bangladeshi authorities are imposing the same restrictions on schools in the refugee camps after five years of them teaching Bengali alongside Burmese and English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children on the Edge struck a deal with the authorities to build schools for Bangladeshi communities first so that the one for refugees would be tolerated. It was largely thanks to the camp's commander, however, that the school at which Mr Hassan is teaching has stayed standing. After the first higher-profile bricks and mortar school was demolished it was he who recommended they think smaller. &quot;He said 'just build it like the houses and I won't say if you don't say',&quot; Mr Littleton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2010 they had built 18, by the next year 36 and a year later 45. That was supposed to be it until August, when a new exodus of Rohingya began across the border into Bangladesh, 60 per cent of them children. Children on the Edge is handing over its old schools to Unicef, the UN agency for children, as it sets about training teachers to run another 100 schools yet to be built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't get to go to school in Burma,&quot; Rafiq, 12, said. He came among one of the earlier waves fleeing Rakhine. His family left after his cousin was &quot;disappeared&quot; by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayesha Aktar, 19, was born in the camp and never learned Burmese. She teaches Bengali to her charges, a job that will soon end unless the Bangladeshi government can be brought round. Learning Burmese might not seem an educational necessity here but Mohammed Rashid, who teaches it, views it as crucial if these children are ever to have any possibility of returning to the country they call home. &quot;It is the language of their country,&quot; he said. &quot;If they want to achieve anything in Burma they will have to know Burmese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The books they use are the same as those in the Burmese government schools from which they are excluded. In Mr Rashid's class they are open at a page showing all the Burmese ethnic groups. These do not include Rohingya, a term the Burmese reject. &quot;There's no Muslims here,&quot; Humira, 10, notes, pointing at the open pages. &quot;We are here but we are not here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children in these schools are among the lucky few able to learn. Others can only wait in hope of their own chance, peeking through the holes in the mud walls while Humira and her friends pore over the pages of other books in which they do not belong either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Donations to Children on the Edge will be matched by a donor, who wishes to remain anonymous, up to the value of &pound;100,000.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A theatre group made up of young Syrian refugees invited to take part in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe is having to pull out because members cannot get the papers ensuring that they will be allowed to return to the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bureaucratic obstacles facing the group, whose organisers receive funding from the British Council, are a twist on the usual reason groups cannot visit Britain - visas being refused from fear that they will not leave again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also another symptom of the crisis facing Syria's five million refugees, who are increasingly unwelcome in neighbouring countries, especially Lebanon, where politicians are campaigning for them to be returned to their war-torn country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed El Attar, who is running the Arab Arts Focus strand at the Fringe, says the performance of The Elephant, Your Majesty!, a well-known Syrian play, originally due to take place at Edinburgh's New Town Theatre will be cancelled after the weekend if the paperwork issue in Lebanon is not solved. The theatre booking itself has already had to be pulled to save costs but another venue could be found if a last-minute reprieve is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are trying to find an alternative space but the deadline is Monday,&quot; Mr Attar said, adding that the group's problems were part of a series of crises faced in his attempts to bring Arab performances to Edinburgh. &quot;We are doing our best,&quot; he said. &quot;We aren't giving up. We come from a region which is difficult so we have to just carry on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatre group is sponsored by Action for Hope, an NGO that trains refugees in art, music and drama. It currently has six students at Lebanese universities courtesy of British Council grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The play, performed by 14 actors aged 13 to 25, has already appeared at theatres across Lebanon. The Elephant, Your Majesty! is a political satire on despotism from the 1960s, written by the bestknown Syrian playwright of recent decades, Saadallah Wannous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actors have applied for British visas on their Syrian passports, but Action for Hope's director, Basma El Husseiny, said that the main problem was not getting to the UK but being sure the actors could leave again. She said that most parents would not allow their children to take part unless they could be assured they would be allowed back into Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon is home to an estimated 1.5 million refugees, more than a million of whom are registered with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. It has never granted them automatic residency, forcing them to apply for papers as if they were ordinary students or workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only an estimated 20 per cent of all refugees have successfully obtained the papers. In the theatre group's case, just four have succeeded, despite having applied five months ago. Even with the papers, it is not clear whether the actors would be allowed back in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't take the responsibility of taking them to Edinburgh and not bringing them back,&quot; said Ms Husseiny, who is an Egyptian citizen and has a British visa. &quot;I don't want to antagonise the Lebanese government, but the bureaucracy is very slow and the law is not clear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lebanese General Security office did not reply to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr Attar, who is from Egypt and travels on a French passport, the Lebanese group's residency issue is just one of a string of problems. Many of the performers he has booked, among them Egyptians, Palestinians, Syrians and others, have failed to obtain British visas despite Arab Arts Focus also being backed by the British Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a producer I would think twice about bringing Arab works to Edinburgh in future,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dawn breaks over a paddy field in southern Bangladesh, the red glow reflecting in its muddy waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rising sun casts light on hill after hill, where the canopies of mango trees have given way to orange and black plastic awnings that shelter the survivors of a brutal ethnic purge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Kutupalong, a sprawling metropolis of bamboo and tarpaulin that has gone, in three months, from a littleknown settlement to the world's largest refugee camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayesha Aktar was born in the original camp 19 years ago, to her refugee parents, among the first mass wave of Rohingya to seek sanctuary from persecution in Rakhine state, Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past three months, she has watched in astonishment as the thousands of refugees who began arriving in late August turned into tens, then hundreds of thousands. &quot;Kutupalong became a city,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't recognise it any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close to 600,000 people now live in a conurbation running from the old Kutupalong through the new extension, merging with Balukhali and a string of other smaller camps to the south. That is 66,000 people per square www.kilometre.No one sets out to build a camp the size of Kutupalong, so new ones were built further south, only for the makeshift metropolis to swallow them up as it spread. Within weeks, Kutupalong and its environs had dwarfed Bidi Bidi, in Uganda, previously the world's largest refugee camp with 272,000, having overtaken Dadaab, which houses 250,000 Somali refugees in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speed and scale of the exodus from Burma has produced a vast slum, among the world's most densely populated places, which aid workers have called &quot;a disaster waiting to happen&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race is now on to transform the camps and the lives of those living in them before the rainy season in March, which threatens to bring landslides, flooding and potentially mass disease as hastily dug wells and latrines fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only three international aid organisations, including Children on the Edge (Cote), a charity backed by The Times-Christmas appeal, had ever been given permission by Bangladesh to work in the Rohingya camps. &quot;Initially almost nobody had staffing and structure in place,&quot; John Littleton, Cote's Asia director, said. &quot;We were one of the very few organisations that had networks of people in camps and people that we could deploy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them was Ms Akhtar, who had grown up to become a teacher in one of Cote's low-profile schools, discretely built among refugee dwellings to avoid provoking a backlash from the desperately poor host Bangladeshi community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity's original focus on children was critical to the crisis response. More than 60 per cent of Kutupalong's residents are children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You walk through the camp and see just an incredible, mind-boggling number of children,&quot; Mr Littleton said. &quot;In a crisis of this scale even the United Nations does not have the resources to reach this number of children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence and privation of the journey here have added to the refugees' needs. One in four of the children arriving is malnourished, according to the World Food Programme. &quot;They have walked for weeks, sometimes only eating leaves,&quot; said Peter Guest, WFP's director for emergencies. &quot;They are arriving in a very poor state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a feeding centre, Subeida, ten, stands holding her eight-month-old baby sister Asma as they wait to receive special rations. Subeida was sent by her mother, who is lying ill with fever in their hut almost 45 minutes' walk away across the camp. Their father was killed in Burma, like so many young men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their absence haunts the camp. Mohammed Zakaria, 25, arrived in Bangladesh after being carried for three days by his brother and neighbours after soldiers attacking their village shot him in the leg. His injuries were so severe, his bones left shattered by the bullet, that he was sent to hospital in Chittagong to have his leg pinned back together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he convalesces in a bamboo and tarpaulin hut built above an open sewer at the bottom of one of Kutupalong's many terraced hills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here every day is like one year,&quot; he said, moving his injured leg in pain. &quot;It's unhygienic, it's crowded, but we have no other choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such complaints are remarkably rare. Most arriving refugees are hauntingly grateful just to have reached a safe place, Ramina Khatun, 25, looked dazed as she waited by the side of the road outside Kutupalong, clutching her tiny daughter, Hasina. The baby was born 15 days earlier on the river bank in Burma as they waited to cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tried to get into the camp but they told us 'There's too many people, you can't come in'. And so we are here,&quot; Ms Khatun said. &quot;But at least we are alive, thank God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Room was finally found for them in the tents of the transit camp on the other side of the road, where new arrivals are housed until camp administrators can work out where to put them. Two hours' walk away, on the far side of the camp, the sound of sawing rings through the air as Kutupalong continues to grow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donations to Children on the Edge will be matched by a donor, who wishes to remain anonymous, up to the value of &pound;100,000</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a year that has seen them subjected to a brutal Burmese military crackdowndescribed as &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; by the UN and US, RohingyaMuslim refugees face the prospect of aconcerning new development in 2018 acrossthe border in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions in the camps of Cox's Bazarcontinue to deteriorate as more Rohingyaarrive, and those trapped here have one oftwo grim options for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past weeks, Bangladesh and the Burmese government have assembled a working group to arrange the repatriation of Rohingyasback across the border, which - if forced - international observers say would be unsafe. At the same time, refugees fear being stuck for many years to come in the camps which have ballooned to rank among the biggest in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a new development along the border, goodwill from local Bangladeshi communitiestowards their embattled fellow Muslims is being stretched to the limit. Tensions are buildingover land and wages, while refugees desperate for cash to buy daily necessities are exposed to exploitation by landowners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has found Rohingya boys as young as 14 are working from dawn to dusk in rice fields outside the makeshift settlements of Cox's Bazar for as little as 300 taka (less than &pound;3) a day, about half the normal local wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I arrived in September,&quot; says Awaz, a 15-year-old from Maungdaw township, just across the border in Burma's western state of Rakhine. &quot;The military came and opened fire so we fled leaving everything behind,&quot; says the boy, who stays over the road in a plastic tent in Thangkhali camp, with his parents, in their thirties, and five brothers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest UN figures suggest an exodus of 655,000 people has taken place across Burma's northwest borderin just four months. After abandoning burning villages, their crops and livelihoods, the refugees have settled along the hilly borders of Cox's Bazar district - on land belonging to locals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The building tension ispiling pressure on the Bangladeshi authorities, who are mindful of the clashes that were sparked in the early Nineties when a more modest influx of fewer than 300,000 Rohingyascrossed the border. Then they were also fleeing persecution in Burma and, again, faced forced repatriation and poor conditions in Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to NGOs working in the area today, Rohingyas are increasingly vulnerable to exploitation by landowners while the massive influx is forcing poor Bangladeshi labourers out of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there are so many Rohingyas that we are not getting any work,&quot; says 60-year old Aminah Khatun. &quot;We used to get some 500-600 taka, but they are much cheaper,&quot; she says. &quot;And the prices of food, fruit and vegetables have almost doubled. We used to pay 1,200 taka for a sack of rice, now it's 2,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the humanitarian crisis nears its fourth month, a preliminary agreement between Bangladesh and Burmato repatriate &quot;expeditiously&quot; the Rohingya is setting nerves on edge among the refugees who fear they will have no guarantees for their safety, or equal rights with the Buddhist majority in Rakhine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh's government announcedlate on Friday that it had prepared a list of 100,000 Rohingya refugees to be repatriated in a first phase. Burmese officials will now consider the list, and both sides say people will only be moved willingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many Rohingyaremain terrified the Burmese military will force them into detention camps, alongside some 120,000 in central Rakhine who were driven out of their villages following intercommunal violence five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local community in Cox's Bazar has so far sympathised with the plight of the Rohingyas. But while some have taken economic advantage of the situation, others ask when the repatriation process will start, even as refugees continue to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They tell us that they'd been persecuted by the Buddhists at home, that we are Muslims like them and have to help them,&quot; says Aminah. There is no resentment in her voice, but with no short-term solutions on the horizon, she hopes they will go back home soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In camps such as Unchinprang water shortages at the beginning of the dry season mean more wells are needed. NGOs have to bargain with locals and pay rent as the camps keep expanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the beginning, the owners of the land were asking for money to buy the land from them for some $50 and relatives in Malaysia would send us money. Now the military has forbidden this but the owners complain because people forage in the forest and cut trees for fuel to cook,&quot; explains Safil, a Rohingya in Kutupalong camp. The overcrowded hills were covered with trees just a few months ago, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influx of aid following the extraordinary humanitarian effort of the past months is also contributing to the bubbling resentment. Asacross the border in Burma when foreign aid was first delivered in the 1990s to Rohingyas, the local community feels left out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the older Rohingya settlers who fled in the past decades are afraid of losing support and land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We appreciate the pressure of having almost one million refugees in a poor country that needs help,&quot; says Mohammed Abu Asaker, UNHCR spokesperson in Cox's Bazar. &quot;This is why we try to help the local community as well, providing medical facilities for locals for example,&quot; he says. He points out that when there are so many refugees, locals are exposed to illnesses as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya women reveal rape and torture inflicted by Burma forces</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But UNHCR also notes that the Rohingya are refugees because they crossed the border out of fear of their lives. &quot;It's not early to talk about repatriation but the situation in Burma is not conducive for people to go back. We strongly recommend no one goes back unless the root causes of the problem, including citizenship and promoting integration instead of confining them in camp, have been addressed,&quot; the spokesperson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR also confirms that with the end of the rainy season, smugglers are approaching Rohingyas in the camps who want to risk the dangerous and illegal journey by boat to Thailand or Malaysia. Thousands are believed to have lost their lives at sea in 2015 when a crackdown by Thai authorities led smugglers to abandon their human cargoat sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rights activists note that the repatriation agreement, which the two governments are still working out, is likely to exclude many Rohingya as Burma insists on evidence of their former residency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is that the implementation of the agreement is unlikely and many would not meet the requirements anyway,&quot; says Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, an NGO advocating for the rights of the Rohingya for almost two decades. Many refugees fled without documents or do not speak the national Burmese language. &quot;It is not clear what will happen to those who don't meet the requirements,&quot; Ms Lewa adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But among the tents packed into Kutupalong camp, many Rohingya men say they have to get out. &quot;I will never stay here. I want to leave. I hope to get a fake passport and go,&quot; says Safil, father of two children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Press Trust of India news agency on 18 September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Delhi, 18 Sep (PTI): The Centre [federal government] today told the Supreme Court that the Rohingya Muslims are &quot;illegal&quot; immigrants in the country and their continuos stay posed &quot;serious national security ramifications&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centre's affidavit, filed in the apex court Registry, said the fundamental right to reside and settle in any part of the country is available to citizens only and illegal refugees cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to enforce the right.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier during the day, a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra considered the statement of ASG [Additional Solicitor General] Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, that the reply would be filed later today and fixed the PIL [public interest litigation] challenging the deportation of Rohingyas for hearing on 3 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As evident from the constitutional guarantee flowing from Article 19 of the Constitution, the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India as well as right to move freely throughout the territory of India is available only to the citizens of India... No illegal immigrant can pray for a writ of this Court which directly or indirectly confer the fundamental rights in general... ,&quot; the affidavit filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centre said the Rohingya refugees were illegals and their continuous stay pose a grave security threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is submitted that continuance of Rohingyas' illegal immigration into India and their continued stay in India, apart from being absolutely illegal, is found to be having serious national security ramifications and has serious security threats,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government said it may file in sealed cover the details of the security threats and inputs gathered by the various security agencies in this matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centre said that since India is not a signatory to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 1951, the obligations concerned to non-refoulement is not applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That the provisions of Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 1951 and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 1967 cannot be relied upon by the petitioner since India is not a signatory of either of them. It is respectfully submitted that the obligation concerning the prohibition of return/non-refoulement is a codified provision under the provisions of 1951 Convention referred to above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is submitted that this obligation is binding only in respect of the States which are parties to the Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since India is not a party to the said Convention, or the said Protocol, the obligations contained therein are not applicable to India,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bench, also comprising Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud, did not issue notice to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which is already seized of the matter and had on 18 August issued notice to the Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plea, filed by two Rohingya immigrants, Mohammad Salimullah and Mohammad Shaqir, who are registered refugees under the United Nations High Commission of Refugees (UNHCR), claimed they had taken refuge in India after escaping from Myanmar [also known as Burma] due to widespread discrimination, violence and bloodshed against the community there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violent attacks allegedly by Myanmarese armymen have led to an exodus of Rohingya tribals from the western Rakhine state in that country to India and Bangladesh. Many of those who had fled to India after the earlier spate of violence, were settled in Jammu [Indian-administered Kashmir], Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR [national capital region] and Rajasthan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plea said that India has ratified and is a signatory to various conventions that recognise the Principle of &quot;Non- Refoulement', which prohibits deportation of refugees to a country where they may face threat to their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has recently raised &quot;serious concern&quot; over reports of renewed violence and attacks in Myanmar and extended its &quot;strong&quot; support to the Myanmarese government at this &quot;challenging moment&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTERNATIONAL divisions have opened up over the refugee crisis in Myanmar which has been described as ethnic cleansing by a senior United Nations official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China yesterday voiced its support support for a military crackdown by the Myanmar Government, which has been interpreted as Beijing's attempt to head off any attempt to censure Myanmar at the United Nations Security Council when it meets today to discuss the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China was one of the few foreign friends of Myanmar's former junta and is a supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current crisis began when militants from Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority attacked police posts in the western Rakine state on August 25, prompting a military backlash that has so far resulted in a third of the Muslim minority population fleeing their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya refugees have accused soldiers and Buddhist mobs who burned their villages to the ground of committing a number of atrocities. The claims cannot be independently verified as access to Rakhine state is heavily controlled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar's government denies any abuses and instead blames militants for burning down thousands of villages, including many belonging to Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But international pressure on Myanmar increased this week after United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said the violence seemed to be a &quot;textbook example of ethnic cleansing&quot;. The US also expressed concern over the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aung San Suu Kyi was once one of the world's most prominent political prisoners when she was under house arrest for 15 years between 1989 and 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is now accused of turning a blind eye to - or even abetting - a humanitarian catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang yesterday praised her Government's efforts to &quot;uphold peace and stability&quot; in Rakhine. &quot;We hope order and the normal life there will be recovered as soon as possible,&quot; he told a press briefing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh's prime minister yesterday urged Myanmar to take back the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who have fled the violence in Rakhine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visiting a refugee camp, Sheikh Hasina urged Myanmar to view the situation with humanity, saying innocent people were suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 370,000 Rohingya have entered Bangladesh since August 25, said Joseph Tripura, a spokesman for the UN refugee agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real figure may be higher as many new arrivals are still on the move making it difficult to include them in the count, the UN said. Sixty per cent of refugees are children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most are in dire need of food, medical care and shelter after trekking for days through hills and jungles or braving dangerous boat journeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladeshi sources say Myanmar's army recently planted new mines - an allegation denied by Myanmar officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh is already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas who have fled previous outbreaks of violence in Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheikh Hasina's comments came as she visited the Kutupalong camp, one of two official refugee camps which are both full. Aid agencies say the new arrivals desperately need food, shelter and medical help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My personal message is very clear, that they should consider this situation with the eyes of humanity,&quot; she said. &quot;Because these people, innocent people, the children, women ... they are suffering. So these people, they belong to Myanmar. For hundreds of years they have been staying there. How can they deny that they are not their citizens?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bangladesh prime minister said her country would offer Rohingyas shelter until Myanmar took them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also condemned the militants for their role in the violence, but said Myanmar's government should have dealt with the situation more patiently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya families have been arriving in Bangladesh from Myanmar in waves since the 1970s. About 32,000 registered refugees live in the two official camps, but more than 300,000 undocumented Rohingyas were also estimated to be in Bangladesh before this latest influx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh says their presence strains local resources, increases crime and deters tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aung San Suu Kyi's foreign ministry has defended the military for doing their &quot;legitimate duty to restore stability&quot;, saying troops were under orders &quot;to exercise all due restraint, and to take full measures to avoid collateral damage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain and Sweden requested the urgent United Nations Security Council meeting today amid growing international concern over the ongoing violence. The council met behind closed doors in late August to discuss the violence, but could not agree a formal statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Edinburgh Fringe is an explosion of creative energy and every room, street and alley is now a performance space showcasing comedy, theatre, dance and each artistic expression you can imagine. Performers come from all over but many artists, comedians and theatre companies are from London, as are media and audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fringe reflects society, culture and politics and this year, Trump and Brexit are dominant. You can't move for Trump lookalikes handing out flyers. It's quite disturbing. But the festival is also an important platform for raising issues we have forgotten about and are not talking about any more, like Syria and the plight of its refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes it's only when you leave the bubble that you stumble upon something off the beaten track and more challenging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Borders is a play about a young woman artist who by night sprays anti-Assad graffiti across Homs but is then forced to flee the city while pregnant, a British photographer called Sebastian who snaps celebrities like Angelina Jolie and how their paths cross tragically in the Mediterranean Sea. The play is powerful, gripping and brutal. Even though there are only two actors on an empty stage with a couple of stools, you feel as if you are watching a blockbuster movie, such is the vivid story-telling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show has already won awards and tickets are like gold-dust. Its writer, Henry Naylor, began his career as a comedian, was lead writer on Spitting Image and has written a set of plays about Syria and the Middle East called Arabian Nightmares. As a former television man, he knows how to keep an audience hooked by painting pictures and gives distant and difficult foreign policy issue a human face. He tells the stories of the people - especially the women - caught up in the conflict. His last hit play, Angel, was about a Kurdish female sniper who killed IS fighters. In Borders, the female character is deliberately known as &quot;Nameless&quot; because &quot;only the powerful have names&quot; and it reminds us how easy it is to forget people when we don't see them as human beings even when their lives were not that different from our own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria was a highly educated, sophisticated country where art, culture and civilisation was highly valued - just like here. But the Syrian crisis has become faceless as fatigue has set in. We are just not that shocked any more. The images are not new or as arresting as they once were and the people are nameless. They are statistics and refugees, which means they are now a different category of human. We have suppressed Syria. And we don't want to talk about refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lord Dubs is still vigorously campaigning for the Government to do more to help unaccompanied child refugees. As a Jewish child, he was saved from the Nazis in 1938 by the Kindertransport scheme organised by British stockbroker Nicholas Winton. Today Lord Dubs and Winton's daughter, Barbara, are travelling to Calais with the charities Safe Passage and Help Refugees to assist child refugees who are alone, living in squalor and face unimaginable danger like being trafficked into slavery or prostitution. The Government wants to stop the scheme he proposed to help child refugees and there is an ongoing judicial review challenging this decision. Why has it even come to that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a line in the play about how we have built borders round our heart and heads, and it is true. Maybe it's because we feel powerless and impotent. Maybe it's because we're all spinning on the latest news cycle. It took an hour of afternoon theatre to remind the audience of Syria and her refugees. As we filed out in stunned silence wiping away the tears, it was a profound reminder of the power of art and culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angel is coming to the Arcola Theatre in September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haggard dad George needs caffeine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Clooney used to be the hottest thing on the planet apart from the equator. He smouldered his way through the past 20 years making out with beautiful young models and breaking hearts along the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tina Fey brilliantly said of the film Gravity: &quot;It's the story of how George Clooney would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That made me laugh for about four days. But now he has met his match and he's been papped wandering round Lake Como looking like a right shambles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's twins. No, not in a Hugh Hefner way. It's his brand new babies, Ella and Alexander with human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who are clearly keeping him up all night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope feisty feminist Amal is making sure that George does his fair share of nappy-changing and late-night feeding. It would be a whole new take on those adverts he does for that coffee machine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the sweltering heat of Bangladesh'sdusty Balukhali refugee camp, seven-month-old Mahmoud Rohan is burning up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am worried about him,&quot; said his mother, 25-year-old Roshida Begum, in the waiting room of a malnutrition screening centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He got a fever last night but I couldn't reach help. I was told to come here.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with an estimated 625,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees who have fled Burma for camps in Bangladesh since late August, Begum is struggling to feed herself and her baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exodus began when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma says persecution of Rohingya Muslims is 'fake news'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top UN human rights official said on Tuesday that Burma's security forces may be guilty of genocide against the Rohingya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labelled Rohingya militants as terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While now safe from the threat of violence, refugees in Bangladesh now face malnutrition on an &quot;alarming&quot; scale, say aid agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers suspect tiny Mahmoud, who wears an oversized red sports shirt, has severe acute malnutrition - the most serious form of malnourishment. All he has had to eat in the camp, where his family has been for two months, is a few spoonfuls a day of rice mixed with sugar, his mother says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At home in Maungdaw township in Burma's Rakhine state, Begum - who is unable to breastfeed properly - fed Mahmoud with rice water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as a health worker examines him, the circumference of his spindly upper arm indicates the severity of his condition.Around him, other mothers, some wearing black niqabs, sit on benches holding their babies in the small bamboo-walled centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed in rags, eight-year-old Sadril Amin has brought his malnourished sister, 16-month-old Boila Amin, for a check up. Their mother is sick and their father is at the market, the little boy said through a translator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly a quarter of all the Rohingya refugee children in the Bangladeshi camps aged between six months and five years are malnourished, an analysis conducted by UNICEF found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse, it found around 7.5 per cent of all children - around 17,000 youngsters - are affected by severe acute malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children make up around 40 percent of the refugee influx, and are particularly vulnerable to starvation's effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compared to healthy youngsters, severely malnourished under-fives are nine times more likely to die from common infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the visible effects on the body, such as muscle wasting, the condition leads to low immunity, meaning children become much more susceptible to other illnesses. The result is a toxic mix of health problems that can be fatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a child is malnourished, they can easily suffer from diarrhoea or pneumonia, and have to be referred to a hospital,&quot; said Charles Erik Haider, a doctor with the International Organization for Migration, in a clinic adjacent to the screening centre.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had to drink water from a pool made by the monsoon rain,&quot; said Mohammad Hassim, 25, from his newly built hut on the other side of Balukhali camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he didn't eat for the final eight days of his arduous trek to Bangladesh, which included nearly three weeks hiding in the hills, and fell sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the camps, food aid is being distributed by the Bangladeshi Army and World Food Programme - families are given rice, lentils and oil every fortnight - but many children are still struggling to eat properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the dangers presented by malnutrition, many Rohingya mothers don't realise lack of nutritious food is the underlying health issue causing other illnesses in their children, said Haider, at the camp's clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, parents will not realise the child is malnourished until they see a doctor for another reason. Many only know there is a problem when their babies' traditional bangles begin to slip from their skinny wrists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is not much understanding of nutrition,&quot; said Haider. &quot;We need to increase awareness around feeding. Education is the key.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, baby Mahmoud's condition is worrying the health workers, and he is referred to see Haider. His mother carries the baby the short distance to the clinic over a bamboo bridge, and is ushered inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The child has a 103 F (39.4C) fever,&quot; Haider said. &quot;It's very bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He makes a diagnosis of pneumonia and prescribes antibiotics for Mahmoud, with an instruction to return if there is no improvement. His mother simply nods and rocks Mahmoud as he cries on her knee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is also given Plumpy Nut - an emergency therapeutic food made from peanut paste - to feed her son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For him, the future is uncertain. &quot;With God's help he will get better,&quot; his mother said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">528 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan -- The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today welcomed a multi-year contribution of &pound;7.5 million (approximately US$ 9.9 million) spread over three years from the Government of the United Kingdom to respond to the critical needs of South Sudanese refugees in Sudan, and those anticipated to arrive between 2018 and 2020.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR will use the funds to provide life-saving assistance to respond to the vital needs of the South Sudanese refugees as well as host communities in White Nile; West and South Kordofan; and East and South Darfur in the area of protection, water and sanitation, and education. The funds will also allow UNHCR to procure non-food items, such as blankets, sleeping mats and cooking kits, for this vulnerable population. South Sudanese refugees arrive in Sudan in very poor condition, exhausted after long walks to reach the borders and in urgent need of protection, especially children who have lost or been separated from their families during the journey.<BR><BR>Dr. Christopher Pycroft, Head of the Department for International Development in Sudan, said &quot;The unfolding tragedy in South Sudan has had terrible human consequences.The British people stand by those affected by conflict and famine, and commit to continue to support the hundreds of thousands of women and children who have been forced to flee their own country, by providing them with safety, food and water and a roof over their heads.DFID has committed to provide this assistance over three years to help our partner UNHCR, and the other aid agencies involved, to plan ahead and deliver life-saving assistance on the ground more effectively, and to help ensure that children continue to have access to Education even during this time of crisis.&quot;<BR><BR>The UK has been a major donor to UNHCR in Sudan for years, contributing over &pound; 14.8 million (around US$ 20.8 million) in the past four years. This has enabled UNHCR to assist refugees in the country and has greatly contributed to supporting the South Sudan response since the early days of the crisis.<BR><BR>Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR's Representative in Sudan particularly welcomed this multi-year agreement and said: &quot;The United Kingdom has consistently demonstrated its commitment to UNHCR activities to assist the most vulnerable children and people from South Sudan. In an operational context that can change very quickly, this multi-year funding will give more predictability and flexibility to UNHCR to respond more efficiently and at scale when a crisis hits and help respond to expected needs in 2018 as part of our contingency planning&quot;.<BR><BR>To date, close to 453,000 South Sudanese have crossed into Sudan since December 2013, and are now residing across 9 states, in addition with an estimated 350,000 remaining in Sudan since the secession of South Sudan in 2011.<BR><BR>Sudan continues to open its borders to refugees seeking safety in the country, which is critical as the conflict in South Sudan is becoming ever more complex in parallel with a worsening food security situation.<BR><BR>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com)) </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the United Nations refugee agency on Thursday urged global leaders to find political solutions to the world's conflicts, if the swelling numbers of forcibly displaced people are ever to return home.<BR><BR>&quot;Securing solutions for the millions of people uprooted around the world, and avoiding a repeat of the massive outflows that have taken place over recent years, ultimately rests on political solutions,&quot; UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said as he briefed the UN Security Council in New York.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Painting a dire picture of the reality the international community now faces, he said that a succession of major new crises has caused massive displacement across virtually all regions of the globe, he said, noting that the number of people forcibly displaced worldwide is now approaching 66 million - up from 42 million in 2009.<BR><BR>This includes 17.2 million refugees under the responsibility of the High Commissioner's Office (UNHCR), a 70 per cent increase since then.<BR><BR>Mr. Grandi cited several ongoing crises, including in Syria and Iraq, which together accounted for a quarter of all those forcibly displaced. But new crises have developed, he said, with many unfolding &quot;in ungoverned spaces, driven by varying combinations of poverty and underdevelopment, environmental degradation, inequality and persecution.&quot;<BR><BR>Manuel Elias Recalling his recent visit to Bangladesh, at the border with Myanmar, he said he witnessed the most rapid refugee exodus since the massive population movements of the mid-1990s. Indeed, the Rohingya fight from Myanmar's Rakhine state is a stark illustration of what happens when the root causes of conflict and violence are not addressed, and the relationship between a State and some of its people breaks down. &quot;The result is a human tragedy on a dramatic scale,&quot; he stated. At the same time, situations that appeared to have stabilized, such as those in Burundi, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, had been affected by new crises triggering new refugee outflows; while protracted situations, such as in Afghanistan and Somalia, remained entrenched.<BR><BR>'Have we become unable to broker peace?' UNHCR chief asks Council<BR><BR>Mr. Grandi warned that the international community is failing to generate political solutions.<BR><BR>&quot;Have we become unable to broker peace?&quot; he asked. &quot;I ask this question here, in the Security Council, whose raisons d'etre are conflict resolution and sustaining peace - because I see the direct impact of these failures, every day, on the lives of tens of millions of people, uprooted and forced to abandon their homes.&quot;<BR><BR>Outlining several action points for the Council, Mr. Grandi said the 15-member body first needs to support preventative measures to address the causes of conflict and avoid deepening displacement crises.<BR><BR>Humanitarian actors and peacekeepers should draw on their diverse strengths to help protect civilians affected by conflict, while at the same time preserving the neutral, impartial character of humanitarian action, he said.<BR><BR>Mr. Grandi also called for resolute action &quot;to tackle the horrific abuses perpetrated by traffickers and identify and prosecute them.&quot;<BR><BR>Without the restoration of peace and security, however, it would be impossible for refugees and other displaced persons to return home.<BR><BR>&quot;Only 500,000 refugees worldwide returned home last year. And very few displacement situations in the last decade have been brought to a definitive conclusion,&quot; he said.<BR><BR>&quot;A full response to today's massive displacement flows can only be achieved through action to restore security, resolve conflict and build peace,&quot; he concluded.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Edinburgh Fringe is an explosion of creative energy and every room, street and alley is now a performance space showcasing comedy, theatre, dance and each artistic expression you can imagine. Performers come from all over but many artists, comedians and theatre companies are from London, as are media and audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fringe reflects society, culture and politics and this year, Trump and Brexit are dominant. You can't move for Trump lookalikes handing out flyers. It's quite disturbing. But the festival is also an important platform for raising issues we have forgotten about and are not talking about any more, like Syria and the plight of its refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes it's only when you leave the bubble that you stumble upon something off the beaten track and more challenging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Borders is a play about a young woman artist who by night sprays anti-Assad graffiti across Homs but is then forced to flee the city while pregnant, a British photographer called Sebastian who snaps celebrities like Angelina Jolie and how their paths cross tragically in the Mediterranean Sea. The play is powerful, gripping and brutal. Even though there are only two actors on an empty stage with a couple of stools, you feel as if you are watching a blockbuster movie, such is the vivid story-telling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show has already won awards and tickets are like gold-dust. Its writer, Henry Naylor, began his career as a comedian, was lead writer on Spitting Image and has written a set of plays about Syria and the Middle East called Arabian Nightmares. As a former television man, he knows how to keep an audience hooked by painting pictures and gives distant and difficult foreign policy issue a human face. He tells the stories of the people - especially the women - caught up in the conflict. His last hit play, Angel, was about a Kurdish female sniper who killed IS fighters. In Borders, the female character is deliberately known as &quot;Nameless&quot; because &quot;only the powerful have names&quot; and it reminds us how easy it is to forget people when we don't see them as human beings even when their lives were not that different from our own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria was a highly educated, sophisticated country where art, culture and civilisation was highly valued - just like here. But the Syrian crisis has become faceless as fatigue has set in. We are just not that shocked any more. The images are not new or as arresting as they once were and the people are nameless. They are statistics and refugees, which means they are now a different category of human. We have suppressed Syria. And we don't want to talk about refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lord Dubs is still vigorously campaigning for the Government to do more to help unaccompanied child refugees. As a Jewish child, he was saved from the Nazis in 1938 by the Kindertransport scheme organised by British stockbroker Nicholas Winton. Today Lord Dubs and Winton's daughter, Barbara, are travelling to Calais with the charities Safe Passage and Help Refugees to assist child refugees who are alone, living in squalor and face unimaginable danger like being trafficked into slavery or prostitution. The Government wants to stop the scheme he proposed to help child refugees and there is an ongoing judicial review challenging this decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why has it even come to that? There's a line in the play about how we have built borders round our heart and heads, and it is true. Maybe it's because we feel powerless and impotent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe it's because we're all spinning on the latest news cycle. It took an hour of afternoon theatre to remind the audience of Syria and her refugees. As we filed out in stunned silence wiping away the tears, it was a profound reminder of the power of art and culture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to estimates, more than 440,000 internally displaced people have returned to their homes during the first six months of this year. During the same period, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has recorded over 31,000 Syrian refugees returning from neighbouring countries.<BR><BR>Seeking out family members, checking on property, and, in some cases, a real or perceived improvement in security conditions in parts of the country were the primary factors influencing those who decided to return, Andrej Mahecic, a spokesperson for the UN agency, told reporters in Geneva.<BR><BR>&quot;While there is overall increased hope linked to the recent Astana and Geneva peace talks, [we] believe conditions for refugees to return in safety and dignity are not yet in place in Syria,&quot; he said, voicing concern over the sustainability of security improvements as well as significant protection risks in many return areas.<BR><BR>&quot;At this stage, and while UNHCR will be investing to help, with other partners, to improve conditions in accessible areas inside Syria, refugee returns from host countries can neither be promoted nor facilitated by UNHCR at this stage,&quot; he added.<BR><BR>RELATED: Delays in access in Syria 'will mean further death,' warns top UN relief official<BR><BR>In particular, access to displaced populations inside Syria remains a key challenge, noted Mr. Mahecic, highlighting that aid convoys are still unable to access regularly those areas that have become newly accessible.<BR><BR>Other challenges include limited livelihood opportunities, shortages of food and water, and sporadic or non-existent health, education, social and other basic services. Many of Syria's schools have been damaged or destroyed and offer no possibility for education.<BR><BR>In the midst of this complex situation, UNHCR is pursuing a number of preparatory steps, in anticipation of the time when conditions for voluntary repatriation of refugees in conditions of safety and dignity are in place. However, resources remain a major constraint, hindering its efforts.<BR><BR>Of the $ 304 million appeal for its operations to assist the displaced inside Syria in 2017, only $ 103 million (about 33 per cent) has been received by UNHCR.<BR><BR>It is also seeking an additional $ 150 million in 2017 to ramp up its delivery inside Syria to support both the displaced, returnees and other vulnerable people, and to help improve conditions in potential return areas.<BR><BR>The Syrian conflict, now into its seventh year, has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands, displaced some 6.3 million within the country and forced 5.1 million to flee outside its borders. Also, more than 13.5 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 4.5 million in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Distributed by M2 Communications (www.m2.com))   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.K., Dec. 12 -- The UK Government made the following announcement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statement by Ambassador Jonathan Allen, UK Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, at the Security Council Briefing on Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you Mr President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I'd like to begin by thanking our briefers, and if I might particularly say to Special Representative Patten what a profound and incredibly moving testimony you have given this Council. And your final words that inaction must not be allowed to take place is vital for us all. I think you've brought to life a truly horrifying picture, so I commend you for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I'd like to thank Undersecretary-General Feltman for his update on the situation one month after this Council adopted an important Presidential Statement, which included calls for an end to the violence, a safe returns process, humanitarian access, and for the root causes of the crisis to be addressed. I am grateful to you for your continued engagement on this crisis. It is vital that the UN continues to remain engaged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the stark reminder, if anyone needed it, that Special Representative Patten has given us is of the horrors that these Rohingya refugees have suffered, a stark reminder that this is first and foremost a human tragedy, and which this Council must keep its attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past month, we have seen some initial steps in response to this Council's Presidential Statement, which we welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, the recent agreement concerning the voluntary repatriation of refugees, signed by the governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh on 23 November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Myanmar's continued commitment to the Annan Commission recommendations and to the development of Rakhine State through the Union Enterprise mechanism are also worth highlighting. And we welcome the announcement of the new Advisory committee. We support initiatives that promise to build a better future for all communities in Rakhine, without discrimination and regardless of religion or ethnicity. The Commission's recommendations remain a particularly important blueprint for the future given their wide support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr President, there remains much more to be done and it is right that the situation remains on our agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to draw particular attention to the agreement concerning voluntary repatriation of refugees. Now, this is a step in the right direction, but today's conditions in the Rakhine state do not yet allow for the safe, voluntary, and dignified return of refugees to their homes that this Council called for last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1,000 to 3,000 people are still fleeing in fear from the Rakhine state into Bangladesh every week. There are continued reports of intercommunal tensions and arson attacks, as Undersecretary-General Feltman set out. As we have said many times before the violence and human rights violations must stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we recognise the desire to move forward quickly, we can only support returns which are safe, voluntary and dignified. This will require independent, international monitoring to ensure the conditions are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rights of the Rohingya must be respected by the Burmese Government, including freedom of movement and access to basic services and livelihoods. They must be allowed to return home, not to prolonged stays in IDP camps, and be given a pathway to citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The responsibility for making progress lies primarily with the government and security forces of Myanmar. And the actions they must take are already set out in the Presidential Statement agreed unanimously by this Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr President, let us recall that in that statement, this Council called for the UNHCR to be invited to be a full participant in the returns process. Myanmar recognises UNHCR's expertise but so far has resisted giving them the necessary role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that statement, we called for transparent investigations into allegations of serious human rights abuses and violations. Not just because those responsible must be held accountable, but also so that refugees have may have confidence in their eventual return. So far, all we have seen is a whitewash by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that statement, we called for full and unhindered access to Rakhine state for UN agencies, their humanitarian partners, and the media. But the government continues to severely limit access to Rakhine, making it impossible to deliver vital humanitarian assistance or verify the situation on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr President, the situation regrettably means that we must continue supporting refugees where they are right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Bangladesh, along with UN agencies and other humanitarian partners, continues to play a vital role, providing life-saving shelter and assistance. Unfortunately, it is likely that Bangladesh will need to play this role for longer than any of us would like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is critical, therefore, that longer-term plans are put in place to protect and provide for refugees in Bangladesh and internally displaced people in Rakhine state. And it is critical, too, that these plans are properly funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of an annual program of $210 million to Bangladesh, the UK has contributed $79 million to the UN's current Humanitarian Response Plan, providing life-saving assistance and protection to the refugees and Bangladeshi host communities. But the plan is still only partially funded and in any case, it runs out in February 2018. We encourage the international community to step up its contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr President, I want to turn briefly before concluding to the Secretary-General's appointment of a Special Envoy. It will be an important, sensitive role, so we support the Secretary-General in deliberating over the appointment carefully. When he or she is appointed, we call on Myanmar to engage with them openly and in good faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr President, I said at the beginning that SRSG Patten's briefing was a stark reminder that this is a human tragedy that the Council must not turn its attention from. We cannot change the horrors, the crimes that have already been committed. But that is all the more reason, then, that this Council must remain engaged, must remain seized of the situation, and must be ready to take further action if necessary to ensure the protection, justice, and progress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They landed in Greece to assist those in need at a refugee camp last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Jamie Jewitt and Camilla Thurlow continued to document their philanthropic efforts for fans on social media on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'humbled' Scottish beauty, 27, took to Instagram to share snaps of the pair helping out at a homeless shelter in Thessaloniki - before male model Jamie posted a number of sweet videos of him playing games with the children on his own page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camilla, who is a keen contributor to charity, first took to her Instagram to share a number of snaps with Jamie, 26, at a homeless shelter in the north of Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair were first seen preparing wraps for the refugees, clad in matching fundraising T-shirts with the words 'Choose Love' emblazoned across the front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple, who came second on ITV2's Love Island, then posed in front of a blackboard at the camp - which detailed the impressive amount of provisions they have provided over the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly overwhelmed by the day, Camilla accompanied the snaps with an emotional caption, which read: 'Today we were immensely humbled to join the Soul Food Kitchen team to help with the preparation and distribution of meals to homeless refugees in Thessaloniki.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We met the loveliest volunteers who are not only giving their time here, but are acting as powerful advocates back at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They have made the decision to #chooselove&nbsp;with @HelpRefugeesUK, and their efforts are making an incredible difference to wonderful people trapped in a desperate situation.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having announced they are making a short film about their time in the country, she then added to fans: 'The extremely talented @jamiejewitt_ is doing an amazing job of capturing footage of our time here, and we cannot wait to share it all with you.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the trip marking his first time helping out at such a location, it is no wonder Jamie, 27, was also keen to share his day with followers on social media.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking to his story on the site, he shared a snap of him standing in a marquee as he set up an obstacle course for the children - before posting a sweet video of him and Camilla racing round the track with the youngsters.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having displayed his musical talents on the reality series, the hunk then proceeded to teach the kids to play guitar, before they settled on the sofa to tell them stories for the rest of the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added of his day: 'Today we were working with the #soulfoodkitchen prepping and packing meals which we then drove around and distributed throughout the streets of Thessaloniki.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We met multiple homeless refugees and visited their temporary homes, we were even cooked for after being given a tour of a particular groups makeshift settlement.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly emotional about the experience, he then added: 'What a day.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camilla and Jamie arrived at Greece's Nea Kavala relocation camp last week, where they planned to spend time helping with the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bomb disposal expert Camilla and her beau took to Instagram earlier this week to share snaps from their trip, with Camilla calling their time in Greece 'incredible' - amid reports some of their co-stars are charging thousands for nightclub appearances.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple have been volunteering with charity A Drop In The Ocean at the refugee camp, which is 20km from the Macedonian border, and are set to make a short film about the organisation's charity efforts.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overwhelmed by the experience, Camilla wrote on Instagram on Monday: 'Our whole trip has been coordinated by the amazing @hollypenalver founder of @indigovolunteers, and after an exceptional day one we are so excited to see what the rest of the week will bring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We will be keeping you updated on a daily basis, and will provide full information on how you can get involved in a short documentary when we get back.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the snaps, the couple could be seen distributing bags of food, water and clothing to the refugees present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calvin Klein model Jamie added: 'I have never had such a rewarding experience.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camilla, who is rumoured to have dated Prince Harry, has previously hinted she would like to make documentaries about humanitarian causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their trip comes after the Mirror  reported their Love Island co-star Olivia Attwood is charging as much as &pound;10,000 for a public appearance, with winning couple Kem and Amber also raking in thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MailOnline has contacted a representative for Olivia for comment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple have been inseparable since leaving the villa, posting endless loved-up selfies on Instagram and documenting their time together.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite bagging herself a model on the series, Camilla has revealed she struggled with her body confidence while surrounded by her fellow swimwear-clad Islanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The softly-spoken reality star - who became the nation's sweetheart during her seven week stint in the Hidden Hills villa - admitted that she questioned her incredible petite frame while in Mallorca, alongside statuesque Olivia Attwood and Tyla Carr.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollywood star Russell Crowe has slammed Australia for refusing New Zealand 's offer to resettle 150 refugees stranded on Manus Island and Nauru.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actor hit back at his critics, who are furious he has used his high profile to criticise Australia's border protection policies on the same day New Zealand's new Labour Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern visited Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If one of the men on Manus was your brother, your uncle, your father...your son...,' the New Zealand-born actor tweeted on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The world is watching Australia and we look like a**holes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowe also doubled down on his Twitter critics who accused him of being uninformed on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Go ahead write stupid articles, send me abuse, call me naive. Doesn't change that what Australia has done to these men on Manus is appalling,' Crowe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His social media spat came as Ms Ardern visited Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at Kirribilli House on Sydney Harbour and renewed her nation's offer to accept 150 refugees from Manus Island, in Papua New Guinea, and Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'New Zealand holds an obligation generally to make sure that we maintain our obligations to the United Nations to take refugees,' she told reporters on Sunday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An uncomfortable looking Mr Turnbull said his government had to first consider its refugee-swap deal with the United States.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In the wake of that, obviously we can consider other ones,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to the drama, right-wing former Liberal immigration minister Kevin Andrews called on his own side of politics to consider New Zealand's offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We should give consideration to what New Zealand is offering,' he told Sky News on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The reality is we have an intractable problem at the present time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Yes, the United States are going to take some of these people but there's still a large number there.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr Andrews said Australia should only accept New Zealand's offer to take the refugees provided&nbsp;'it doesn't become a backdoor entry via New Zealand to Australia.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Ardern's relationship with Australia has been controversial since her election with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop describing the 37-year-old New Zealand leader as 'untrustworthy' after an MP from her own Labour Party delved into former deputy PM Barnaby Joyce's dual Kiwi citizenship status.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fronting the media at Kirribilli House on Sunday, Mr Turnbull didn't completely shut the door on Ms Ardern's offer to resettle the refugees, saying they had engaged in 'strong talks'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 600 asylum seekers and refugees have barricaded themselves in the Manus Island complex, which officially closed last Tuesday following a Papua New Guinean Supreme Court ruling in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those inside claim they will be attacked by PNG locals if they move to an alternative unfenced accommodation at nearby Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Ardern has reiterated the NZ offer, first made under John Key's centre-right National government to Australia's previous Labor government in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was in the same year it declared, under former prime minister Kevin Rudd, that no asylum seeker on Manus Island would ever be settled in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition Leader Bill Shorten softened Labor's stance on Friday, saying the plan had similarities to the US resettlement deal to take 1,250 people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Thailand-based Myanmar publication Irrawaddy website on 2 November</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Myanmar's accusation that Bangladesh was delaying the Rohingya refugee repatriation process in order to get international aid money, a Bangladesh representation said the director-general of Myanmar's State counsellor Office was &quot;ill-informed&quot; of the process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 600,000 Muslims have fled northern Rakhine State to Bangladesh since Rohingya militant attacks on police outposts triggered military clearance operations in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar has been preparing for the repatriation of those who fled the country, and discussions with the Bangladeshi government are underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, both sides agreed to cooperate to restore stability in restive Rakhine State but failed to reach an agreement over the repatriation of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, U Zaw Htay, the director-general of the State counsellor Office, told media that Myanmar was ready to begin the repatriation process any time, based on the criteria of the 1993 agreement with Bangladesh that covered the return of Rohingya refugee to Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are ready to start but the other side hasn't agreed yet, and the process has been delayed,&quot; he said, before linking the delay to hundreds of million dollars raised so far by the international community to help build refugee camps for the Rohingya on the Bangladeshi side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Currently they have got US$400 million. Over their receiving of this amount, we are now afraid of delays to the programme of deporting the refugees,&quot; he told media on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have got international subsidies. We are now afraid they would have another consideration as to repatriation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Md. Reyad Hossain, the First Secretary of the Bangladeshi Embassy in Yangon, told The Irrawaddy on Wednesday that &quot;it appears that U Zaw Htay is ill informed of the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that Bangladesh handed over a revised paper on the repatriation to the Minister for the State Counsellor Office U Kyaw Tint Swe in Dhaka on 2 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanmar responded on 20 October to the draft, which Bangladesh is now examining, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a meeting in Naypyitaw on Oct. 24, the countries' home ministers agreed that an arrangement to bring back the Rohingya to Myanmar would be finalized within the next few weeks, which would lead to a Joint Working Group preparing the Term of Reference (TOR) for taking back the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hence, the process of consultation is on and it is wrong to blame any side at this stage,&quot; said Md. Reyad Hossain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh had to seek international monetary assistance to meet the formidable humanitarian challenge created due to Myanmar's action in the Rakhine State, said the first secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Myanmar could expect this kind of monetary support and &quot;much more&quot; from the international community if it agreed to resettle and integrate the Rohingya into Myanmar society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This, however, depends upon Myanmar's sincerity to find durable and inclusive solutions,&quot; said the first secretary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of an estimated 40,000 Rohingya Muslims living in Indiaare illegal immigrants, even those registered with the UN refugee agency, and the government aims to deport them, a senior government official hastold Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junior interior minister Kiren Rijiju told parliament last week the central government had directed state authorities to identify and deport illegal immigrants including Rohingya, who face persecution in Buddhist-majority Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has issued identity cards to about 16,500 Rohingya in India that it says help them &quot;prevent harassment, arbitrary arrests, detention and deportation&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But MrRijiju, a high-profile minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government, said in an interview that the UNHCR registration was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma rejects allegations of human rights abuses against Rohingya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are doing it, we can't stop them from registering. But we are not signatory to the accord on refugees,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as we are concerned they are all illegal immigrants. They have no basis to live here. Anybody who is anillegal migrant will be deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR's India office said on Monday the principle of non-refoulement<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>&quot; or not sending back refugees to a place where they face danger<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>&quot; was considered part of customary international law and binding on all states whether they have signed the Refugee Convention or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The office said it had not received any official word about a plan to deport Rohingya refugees, and had not got any reports deportations were taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treatment of the roughly one million Rohingya in Burmahas emerged as its most contentious human rights issue as it makes a transition from decades of harsh military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Burmaand classified as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots there that go back centuries, with communities marginalised and occasionally subjected to communal violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled from Burma, with many taking refuge in Bangladesh, and some then crossing a porous border into Hindu-majority India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have also headed to South East Asia, often on rickety boats run by people-smuggling gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya are generally vilified in India and over the past few months, there has been a string of anti-Rohingya protests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8203;</SPAN>MrRijiju declined to comment on the deportation process, even as some human rights activists question the practicality of rounding up and expelling thousands of people scattered across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a procedure, there is a rule of law,&quot; MrRijiju said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't throw them out just like that. We can't dump them in the Bay of Bengal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India said lastFriday it was in talks with Bangladesh and Burmaabout the deportation plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But deportation is likely to be difficult, given Burma's position that all Rohingya need to be scrutinised before they can be allowed back in as citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma officials were not immediately available for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior government official in Bangladesh, which has complained of being burdened by the heavy flow of refugees, has said India was helping it solve the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 75,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since 9Octoberafter an insurgent group attacked Burmaborder police posts, prompting a security crackdown in which troops have been accused of themurder and rape of Rohingya civilians.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN eye-opening documentary following the lives of 240 Syrian refugees who arrived in Ireland seven months ago will be broadcast on TV3 next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireland's Refugee Hotel airs on Thursday and the powerful and emotive drama lays bare a split in the community as the newcomers are bussed into Ballaghadereen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quiet Co Roscommon town has just 1,800 inhabitants and at first the decision to house refugees at the Abbeyfield Hotel is met with suspicion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the locals get to hear first-hand accounts of the war in Syria through the eyes of survivors the majority open their arms, and hearts, to their new neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghassan, 21, left Syria 18 months ago and paid smugglers so he could risk his life making the journey by boat across the Mediterranean Sea to Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Six times I was caught by the Turkish navy. The last time I went out I said I wouldn't wear te r a lifejacket, so if anything happened it would be over. I'd had enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghassan travelled with his aunt and great-aunt but he had to leave his mother and his younger siblings behind in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I'm afraid for my family. I miss them. I want them to come here. Before Syria was very beautiful, now the war has taken everything.&quot; His pal Kj Kamel, 24, who made the journey alone, tells how his mother was shot dead through his bedroom window four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He revealed: &quot;I had just woken up when she fell on the sofa. I didn't understand what had happened. &quot;Then I went towards her and saw the bullet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tearful Kamel wept: &quot;I was trying to keep her with me so I didn't lose her. Butlost her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hotel manager Jackie Mullen looks forward to welcoming the refugees but admits 240 people living in such close quarters presents daily challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;At first they were very subdued. You could tell they'd been to hell and back. I just want to make them feel safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point she calls gardai after a squabble between children escalates into a punch-up betweenae ts the adults. But things run smoothly most of the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feelings run high as anti-Muslim leaflets are circulated but the local barber - a Pakistani Muslim who's lived in Ireland for 15 years - helps calm things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women are welcomed into the knitting circle, the younger men join the GAA team and there's a tour of the town pointing out places of interest including the post office where the refugees collect their (EURO)19.10 weekly allowance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghassan's aunt, whose husband is missing feared dead after a bomb attack in Damascus, says she travelled for the sake of her children Judy and Ahlam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;I keep asking about housing so we can settle. The children need routine. I am tired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hotel neighbour Anne sums up her change of heart towards the new residents. At the outset she says: &quot;I am afraid to walk up the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after five months living alongside the refugees she admits this is no longer the case, adding: &quot;What made me change my mind was when they spoke to me. When they said hello, I wasn't afraid then.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20-year-old model's own father, Mohamed Hadid, was able to move to the US as a refugee so many years ago - but now, she fears, it's much harder for people from the Middle East to follow a similar path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Covering the October issue of&nbsp; Harper's Bazaar Arabia, Bella not only shares her disapproval of the travel ban, but voices that she finds the President's actions 'crazy'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'My dad was a refugee,' Bella told the magazine after her Venice photoshoot with photographer Victor Demarchelier. 'He came from Palestine to America when he was a baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed was born in 1948 in Nazareth (which was then Palestine but has since become a part of Israel). As a child, he moved with his family to Damascus, Syria - but upon later returning to Israel, Mohamed's father Anwar learned he was expelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The months that followed were tumultuous, with both of Mohamed's parents living as refugees. They eventually moved to Lebanon, where Anwar worked for the US government-funded international news agency Voice of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They finally moved to America when Mohamed was 14, and he grew up to be a real estate mogul and father of five (including two supermodels) - a life story many would say is the American dream.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now his daughter Bella is troubled that others will be unable to follow in his footsteps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Thankfully, he was able to come, but it was very hard and now it's probably 100 times harder,' she said. 'It makes me sad that power is getting taken from a lot of people and they're not able to make a new life for their children and their families.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, she's baffled by the fact that seemingly a single person - Trump - has been able to unilaterally make that call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's crazy to me that one person can tell you whether or not you can have a better life,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't the first time she has shared her thoughts on the travel ban. In January, she joined protesters #NoBanNoWall march in New York City.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I just wanted to stand up for what I felt was right and I really didn't care if I was with 100,000 other people because, with or without security, I wanted to go and stand for something I believe in,' she said. 'Nobody was even looking.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, though, the Hadids have gone head-to-head with Trump before - but the first time, it was over real estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987, Donald and Mohamad squabbled over a piece of property in Aspen, which had gone into foreclosure.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump had put down money to buy the property so he could build a hotel on it - but Mohamed found a loophole, paying off a debt on the site to get the land himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump still claims that no one has ever beat him in a deal, but that's not true anymore. I beat Trump,' Hadid told  Regardie's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump tried to sue Hadid, but the latter developer just saw his profile rise, and went on to&nbsp;build a Ritz-Carlton and Silver Circle Ice Rink, and run the redevelopment of the Continental Inn, in Aspen.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD; Version:4</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">679 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis has asked for forgiveness from refugees in Bangladesh for the hurt and persecution they have endured, and spoke the word he had avoided days earlier in Burma: &quot;Rohingya&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a deeply moving encounter in Dhaka, Francis greeted and blessed a group of Rohingya Muslim refugees, grasping their hands and listening to their stories in a show of public solidarity amid Asia's worst refugee crisis in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He apologised for the &quot;indifference of the world&quot; to their plight and then pronounced the name of their ethnic group to a gathering of Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and Christian leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presence of God today is also called 'Rohingya',&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 16 Rohingya - 12 men, two women and two young girls - had traveled to Dhaka from Cox's Bazar, the district bordering Burma where refugee camps are overflowing with more than 620,000 Rohingya who have fled what the UN says is a campaign of ethnic cleansing by Burma's military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign has included the burning of villages and fleeing Rohingya have described rape and shootings by Burmese soldiers and Buddhist mobs that left them no option but to make the dangerous and sometimes deadly journey through jungles and by sea to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burma government has denied any such campaign is under way. The army says &quot;clearance operations&quot; are targeting militants who attacked security positions in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma's government and most of the Buddhist majority opoose the term &quot;Rohingya&quot;, saying the members of the Muslim minority are &quot;Bengalis&quot; who migrated illegally from Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma does not acknowledge them as a local ethnic group and will not give them citizenship, even though they have lived in Burma for generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one, each of the refugees approached the Pope at the end of the event in the tented garden of the Dhaka archbishop's residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis blessed one little girl, placing his hand on her head, and grasped the shoulder of a young man. The women who approached him pushed aside their headscarves so they could speak, offering their hands out for him to hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe we can't do much for you, but your tragedy has a place in our hearts,&quot; hetold them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His voice trembling with emotion, he continued: &quot;In the name of all those who persecute you, who have persecuted you, and those who have hurt you, above all in the indifference of the world, I ask you for forgiveness. Forgiveness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing the &quot;big heart&quot; of Bangladesh that welcomed them, Francis said: &quot;Now I appeal to your big hearts, that you are able to grant us the forgiveness that we seek.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for continued aid for the refugees, and continued advocacy &quot;so that their rights are recognised&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We won't close our hearts. We won't look away,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis had refrained from publicly raising the crisis or using the word Rohingya in Burma out of diplomatic deference to his hosts. The Holy See only established diplomatic relations with Burma in May, and the local Catholic Church had begged Francis not to create waves - and possible problems for them - by using the term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights organisations and Rohingya had voiced disappointment at his public silence, given he had previously denounced the persecution of &quot;our Rohingya brothers and sisters&quot; at the Vatican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vatican defended it as diplomatically necessary, and stressed that his silence in public did not negate what he had said in the past, or what he was saying in private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Francis' encounter with the refugees was the highlight of his day that began with a Mass to ordain 16 new priests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh's tiny Catholic community represents a fraction of 1% of the majority Muslim population of 160 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its small size, the Catholic Church runs a network of schools, orphanages and clinics and has enjoyed relative freedom in its work, although Christian missionaries say they have received threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his homily ordaining 16 new priests, Francis thanked those who came out for the Mass, noting that some people had travelled two days to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for your generosity,&quot; Francis said. &quot;This indicates the love that you have for the church.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager suspected of planting theParsons Green tube bombis a refugee from Iraq who came to the UK after his parents were killed, it was claimed tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     CCTV footage released tonight showed a man with a Lidl baglike the one containing the bomb which exploded on the train, injuring 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With dark collar-length hair, in a maroon cap, he was pictured near the home of foster parents at 6.50am, just 90 minutes before a fireball ripped through the packed carriage on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The footage, obtained by ITV, was captured near theproperty in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, raided by armed policewho evacuated neighbouring homes within 100 metres.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Chilling CCTV 'shows Parsons Green attacker leaving home with bomb in Lidl bag 90 minutes before tube blast injured 30'                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sped to the property after an18-year-old was arrested at 7.50am in Dover port on Saturday morningas he attempted to board a ferry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second suspect, from Syria, aged 21 is believed to have been fostered by the same couple as him. He was arrested at a takeaway near Heathrow Airport at midnight on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the first suspect had come to Britain as a 15-year-old after he had spent months attempting to smuggle himself into the UK, while living in the notorious makeshift Calais refugee camp known as The Jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee charity is believed to have helped his passage into Britain in 2014 and placed him in foster care with at least two families in Kent, before he moved in with another family in South West London in the last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative leader of Spelthorne Borough Council Ian Harvey - whose ward is Sunbury East close to where the teenager had been living - said last night: &quot;One thing I understand is that he was an Iraqi refugee who came here aged 15. His parents died in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penelope and Ronald Jones, aged 71 and 88, who received MBEs from the Queen for services to children and families, took the Iraqi teen into their home after a lifetime devoted to caring for vulnerable children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neighbours told yesterday how the couple - who have been foster parents for almost 40 years, taking in up to 300 children, including eight refugees - were &quot;at their wits' end&quot; with the teenager who had only been living with them for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could CCTV footage show the Parsons Green tube bomber?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect, who is being held in custody on suspicion of planting the homemade bucket bomb on the London Underground, is said to have had a furious bust-up with his foster parents two weeks ago after he was brought back to the house in leafy Sunbury-upon-Thames in a marked police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area is just a 37-minute train ride from Wimbledon station, where the tube that was bombed began its journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood he was picked up by police at Parsons Green station two weeks ago - where the bomb exploded - before being escorted back to the Jones' home in a squad car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night a 21-year-old man, thought to be a Syrian refugee originally from Damascus, was also being interrogated in connection with Friday's attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-terror police seized him at a restaurant in Hounslow, West London, just before midnight on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed police raided his home, a modern mid-terrace house in nearby Stanwell, opposite the cargo bay at Heathrow Airport. Intelligence agencies are probing a theory that the pair could have been targeting the airport as well as the London transport network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed the second suspect - who has also not been named - was an asylum seeker who was also taken in by Mr and Mrs Jones after arriving in the UK from war-torn Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Counter-terror cops arrest second man in connection with Parsons Green bombing as officers search Stanwell home                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is thought to have come to Britain in 2015 and attended a local college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland Yard forensics officers wearing protective overalls, hoods and face masks were inside the Stanwell flat throughout yesterday. It is believed no explosive materials were found there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Griffiths, who lives across from Penny and Ron, told how police said the couple's home would be examined by forensics officers for &quot;at least a week&quot; after &quot;significant materials&quot; were found in the loft space above the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I think that while Penny and Ron have been away, the lads were in the loft taking bit by bit down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was only yesterday when they said the guy had been making bombs in there that I thought: 'What?' This is all just crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Builder Dave Solway, 44, who also lives opposite the elderly couple, told of a row between the 18-year-old suspect and Ron outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lad was out the front shouting and swearing at Ron, telling him he was leaving. I know the couple were at their wits' end, I think they were told he was a lot younger than he is which is why they agreed to take him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poor Ron was trying to get the lad to go in the house but he just kept saying he wanted to leave for London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe this has happened to such nice people, I really feel for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Schoolboy crushed by commuters fleeing Parsons Green bucket bomb reveals terrifying ordeal                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family friend Jim Adaway, 37, said the Joneses had only recently returned to foster caring to help resettle youngsters from overseas, after requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I think Penny was getting in touch with the council and telling them she couldn't handle the teenager as he was out of control. I don't know if they felt it was the right decision to start taking kids on again which is such a shame after everything they've done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other neighbours told how terror police recovered explosives from the Jones' house. A mum - who identified herself as Carrie and lives on the evacuated road - said police told her they had found 15 firearms at the house and a bomb in the garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police refused to comment on speculation about what was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home SecretaryAmber Ruddyesterday said the UK's threat level has been lowered from critical to severe. She added: &quot;It still means an attack is highly likely, so I would urge everybody to continue to be vigilant but not alarmed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the country's top counter-terrorism officer, said police were gaining a &quot;greater understanding of the preparation of the device&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security services are trying to find how the Iraqi teen entered the country and who he had associated with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just one person was last night still being treated in hospital following the bomb attempt - for serious wounds to their lower body.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">557 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by leading English-language Pakistani daily Dawn website on 16 August</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peshawar: Countrywide registration of undocumented Afghan nationals will start on Wednesday (today) and would continue till the end of December.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director General Afghan Commissionerate Waqar Maroof said that approximately one million Afghan nationals, who were residing in Pakistan without legal documents, would be registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that around 600,000 Afghan nationals were likely to be registered in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said that around 200,000 unregistered Afghan nationals had gone back to their country in 2016 to avoid deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an opportunity for the unregistered Afghans to get themselves registered with the authorities concerned,&quot; he said, adding that the staff would facilitate applicants at the designated registration centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry of State and Frontier Regions and Afghan Commissionerate in collaboration with Afghanistan Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation are undertaking the drive. The government will issue Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) to them to legalize their stay in Pakistan for unspecified period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government has tasked National Database and Registration Authority to conduct the long awaited registration process. For this purpose, Nadra has set up 21 centres in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enrolment of undocumented Afghan nationals was part of the 20-point National Action Plan, which was unveiled in early 2015. Sources said that differences between interior and Safron ministries caused delay in launching the documentation process. The government will obtain accurate data about undocumented Afghans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 11 registration centres have been set up including three in Peshawar and two in Nowshera while Mardan, Haripur, Dera Ismail Khan, Lower Dir, Kohat and Mansehra have one centre each. The estimated cost of the project is Rs175 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said that representatives of Afghan Ministry for Refugees and Repatriations would be present at those registration centres for monitoring the process. After compiling data and other particulars, the authority would issue ACCs to eligible families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadra and Afghan Commissionerate had launched pilot project last month to streamline the process. Under the pilot project, the authority had set up one centre in Islamabad and another in Peshawar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said that average 110 Afghan families approached the centre in Peshawar on daily basis to obtain the card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said that the card would protect registered Afghan citizens from harassment at the hands of law enforcement agencies including police. Police are largely blamed for harassing and torturing refugees as well as unregistered Afghans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, repatriation of refugees is going very slow as compared to previous year. Officials said that about 45,000 refugees had repatriated since January 2017 against over 400,000 in the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said that decrease in cash assistance from $400 to $200 per head was probably one of the major factors that slowed the repatriation process. UNHCR had paid $400 to every returning refugee, however, the amount was decreased to $200 this year due to shortage of funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Registered Afghan refugees will lose their legal status by the end of December after their proof of registration cards would expire.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of an estimated 40,000 Rohingya Muslims living in India are illegal immigrants, even those registered with the UN refugee agency, and the government aims to deport them, a senior government official told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junior interior minister Kiren Rijiju told parliament last week the central government had directed state authorities to identify and deport illegal immigrants including Rohingya, who face persecution in Buddhist-majority Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has issued identity cards to about 16,500 Rohingya in India that it says help them &quot;prevent harassment, arbitrary arrests, detention and deportation&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rijiju, a high-profile minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Government, said in an interview on the weekend that the UNHCR registration was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as we are concerned they are all illegal immigrants They have no basis to live here. Anybody who is illegal migrant will be deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR's India office said on Monday the principle of </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">non-refoulement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>&quot; or not sending back refugees to a place where they face danger<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>&quot; was considered part of customary international law and binding on all states whether they have signed the Refugee Convention or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The office said it had not received any official word about a plan to deport Rohingya refugees, and had not got any reports deportations were taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treatment of the roughly one million Rohingya in Burmahas emerged as its most contentious human rights issue as it makes a transition from decades of harsh military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Burmaand classified as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots there that go back centuries, with communities marginalised and occasionally subjected to communal violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled from Burma, with many taking refuge in Bangladesh, and some then crossing a porous border into Hindu-majority India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have also headed to South East Asia, often on rickety boats run by people-smuggling gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingya are generally vilified in India and over the past few months, there has been a string of anti-Rohingya protests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8203;</SPAN>Rijiju declined to comment on the deportation process, even as some human rights activists question the practicality of rounding up and expelling thousands of people scattered across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a procedure, there is a rule of law,&quot; Rijiju said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't throw them out just like that. We can't dump them in the Bay of Bengal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India said on Friday it was in talks with Bangladesh and Burmaabout the deportation plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But deportation is likely to be difficult, given Burma's position that all Rohingya need to be scrutinised before they can be allowed back in as citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burma officials were not immediately available for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior government official in Bangladesh, which has complained of being burdened by the heavy flow of refugees, has said India was helping it solve the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 75,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since 9Octoberafter an insurgent group attacked Burmaborder police posts, prompting a security crackdown in which troops have been accused of murder and rape of Rohingya civilians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">UCL launches programme of research and education in Lebanon<BR><BR>2 October 2017<BR><BR>Academics from the UCL Institute of Education (IOE) will today join the Prime Minister of Lebanon, Saad Hariri, to launch a new UCL research centre that aims to better support urban communities hosting huge numbers of refugees.<BR><BR>Professor Diana Laurillard, Dr Tejendra Pherali, Dr Elaine Chase and Dr Eileen Kennedy, all from the IOE, will contribute to the five-year initiative that seeks to improve the prosperity of Lebanon, the country that contains the most refugees as a percentage of its population in the world.<BR><BR>Led by Professor Henrietta L.Moore, Director of UCL's Institute for Global Prosperity and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council's (ESRC) Global Challenge programme, the RELIEF Centre will partner with other UCL departments as well as the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the Centre for Lebanese Studies.<BR><BR>The RELIEF team will collaborate with local groups in Lebanon to explore how refugee and host communities can work together to build public services and better quality living environments. The programme will also explore what prosperity means for refugees and hosts, and develop tools and frameworks for people to monitor their prosperity gains or deficits in their community.<BR><BR>Speaking at the launch, Professor David Price, Vice-Provost (Research) said, 'UCL was founded with the belief that education should be open to all, and that education has the power to change the world. We draw our inspiration from Jeremy Bentham's belief that we should strive for the greatest good for the greatest number. This serves to remind us of the contribution education can make to building a better world - one that is happier, fairer, and where we all have the opportunity to live prosperous, rewarding lives.<BR><BR>'The RELIEF Centre's priority themes - Education, Liveable Cities, Public Services and Health and Wellbeing - are areas where we hope UCL's cross-disciplinary expertise can make a valuable contribution to the work of colleagues from the AUB and the Centre for Lebanese Studies. These themes are not challenges for Lebanon alone but echoed the world over. That is why it is so important that we can come together as an academic community, and as a truly global university to learn from one another and share wisdom for the benefit of all.'<BR><BR>Professor Laurillard, from the UCL Knowledge Lab, will explore how new technologies can be used to deliver affordable education to both refugees and Lebanese citizens, equipping people with the skills and capacities for managing conflict, and improving their environments and wellbeing.<BR><BR>'We will use the technology of massive open online courses (MOOCs) to interact with adults in the refugee and host populations via smartphone devices, offering low bandwidth options, given the variable quality of internet connectivity. The FutureLearn platform provides the ideal online environment for a genuinely two-way communication. For example, we can test the local value of research findings on community urban regeneration or waste management techniques by listening to the experiences of participants as they learn about these techniques, building our shared understanding of the effective ways to achieve inclusive growth.<BR><BR>'The great value of this research is to bring cross-disciplinary expertise, together with our partner universities in Lebanon, to tackle one of the most challenging social issues of our time, and contribute new conceptual and practical frameworks for action in the field.'<BR><BR>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European and African ministers are to meet in Tunis on Monday to discuss a plan to try to regularise the flow of refugees from Africa to Europe to about 20,000, coupled with a much tougher strategy to deport illegal migrants from Italy and break up smuggling rings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan to regularise the migrant flow is being pushed by the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, which warns that EU efforts to train the Libyan coastguard along with Italy's intention to impose a new code of conduct on NGO rescue ships operating in the Mediterranean do not match the scale of the problem, or recognise the extent to which the flow of refugees and migrants is likely to become permanent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim is to set up screening systems for EU-bound migrants in countries en route to Libya, such as Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Chad and Sudan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Europe seeks a long-term answer to a refugee crisis that needs a solution now | Simon Tisdall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU at a meeting in July set aside enough cash for 40,000 regularised refugees, with as many as half coming from claimants in Syria, and the remainder from Africa. Although the European commission has struggled to persuade all countries to take migrants after a similar scheme set up in following the 2015 migration crisis from Syria, the new scheme would represent a form of solidarity, and provide Italy with some relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Italy is gripped by deep political and civil divisions on the issue, with more than 90,000 migrants reaching Italy from Libya this year. A reduction to 20,000 from Africa would represent a transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining the thinking, Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's new special envoy to the central Mediterranean, said: &quot;We need to regularise the system and stop these dangerous journeys into Libya. Any remedy that focuses on trying to stop the flow of migrants at sea, such as a code of conduct for a NGOs, cannot be the solution. The issue has to be addressed earlier in the countries of origin and transit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Italy also needs to be able to process claimants so the economic migrants are returned much more quickly, or else there will be no deterrent to travel to Italy. Only a third of the migrants reaching Italy are found to be in need of international protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that by the time migrants reached Libya it was often too late. It is thought there are 300,000 Africans from outside Libya trying to get across to Europe or to get some work in Libya. They are living in Libyan detention centres or in warehouses or so-called &quot;connection houses&quot; in the hands of traffickers. The refugees need to be taken out of Libya and these detention centres so they can be processed elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;There has been a lot of rhetoric about closing down the smugglers' business model, but little has happened, but it has to be done more seriously than at present ... Many of the people smugglers can be identified as they advertise their services on Facebook, but little has been done to try to seize their assets or impose travel bans and other sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There tends to be action against the small fry, like the people that steer the boats to Libya in return for a discount on the journey. They are not the people responsible for this system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR recognises that it is necessary to train and capacitate the Libyan coastguards, but there is also a need to prevent human rights abuses and to investigate incidents of collusion with traffickers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first six months of this year, 2,171 refugees and migrants died or went missing in the central Mediterranean, and many others are believed to have died trying to cross into Libya.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by Bangladeshi newspaper The Independent website on 9 September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM NATIVES TO REFUGEES: Leaving their homes in Shahab Bazar area of the Rakhine state there days ago, children and elderly people in the photos walk around 30 kilometres to enter Bangladesh yesterday. They are among the thousands of Rohingyas fleeing attacks by Myanmar [also known as Burma] government forces and managed to cross the remote terrain of their native country without any money or other belongings. They were given food, though sparse, by local volunteers on their arrival at Kanjapara in Cox's Bazar along the Naf River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite an influx of Rohingyas over the past two weeks, national and international aid agencies are yet to provide relief to most of the Rohingya refugees fleeing the violence in Myanmar's Rakhine State. Lack of food, shelter, water and sanitation has created unhealthy conditions in Cox's Bazar and Bandarban of the bordering districts. One runs into scores of hungry and helpless faces everywhere. Moreover, the refugees simply get drenched in rain, as there are no sheds where they can take shelter from the downpour. The plight of Rohingyas who have taken refuge in remote areas and those who have found a place in refugee camps run by aid agencies appear to be the same.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the recent influx, several United Nations (UN) agencies, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), had repeatedly appealed to the Bangladesh government to open the borders for the fleeing Rohingyas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to such appeals, the government is now letting the helpless Rohingya enter. As a result, the number entrants into Bangladesh have now reached almost 270,000, while another 52,000 are waiting on the no-man's land cross over. But the aid agencies are not forthcoming with enough aid for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moulvi Aziz Uddin, Union Parishad chairman of Baharchora, told The Independent on Friday, &quot;Over 70,000 people have entered through different points in my union. I have not seen any aid agencies here so far. The Rohingyas are starving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few aid agencies are reportedly doing some work in their camps, but hundreds of thousands Rohingyas have taken shelter at different places including local schools, madrashas, houses of local people and makeshifts shelters but have so far remained beyond the reach of aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingyas, who entered after walking for two to 10 days from their villages, hiding in jungles, trekking over hills and wading through rivers, are hungry, exhausted and ill. They undertook the dangerous journey to reach Bangladesh in the hope of a safe home but are left starving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN organisation, World Food Programme (WFP), distributed only biscuits to just about 28,000 people, while the UNHCR said on Friday that 270,000 Rohingyas had entered Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An estimated 270,000 refugees arrived in Bangladesh in the last two weeks,&quot; said Vivian Tan, a spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have distributed high-energy biscuits and hotchpotch to 28,000 people. We are making preparations to distribute rice,&quot; said Mahreen Ahmed Khan, communication officer of WFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR, a key organisation for refugees, said it would apply for more funds after getting a vivid picture of the new arrivals. It said it was unable to estimate the funds needed without assessing the needs of the newly arrived Rohingyas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, it seems, that till the funds arrive, the Rohingyas will be starving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This correspondent visited the registered and unregistered Rohingya camps in Ukhiya and Teknaf, and makeshift camps at Balukhali, Thang Khali, Palong khali, Battoli in Ukhiya upaizla, Chakdala, Ashartoli, and Fultoli in Naikhonchhari upazila, and Raikhkong, Unchiprang, Kanjarpara, Jhimonkhali, Lambabeel, Shaplapur and Whykong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everywhere, the Rohingyas said they were starving, as aid agencies were yet to reach them. This correspondent, too, found no aid organisation in these places. Around 1am on Friday, this correspondent spoke to a family at Unchiprang's proposed Madrasha field, where seven members of the family were huddled beneath a tarpaulin but struggled to keep themselves from the rain. They were shivering with cold, as muddy water flowed into the little tent they had managed to erect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The male member of the family, Karimullah, 53, Bosu Ullah, hailing from Maungdaw, said, &quot;We reached here four days ago after spending five days on the way. We have not eaten anything the whole day. During the last three days, some passersby give us some food. No aid agency has come to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same place, Abdus Salm, hailing from Buthidaung, was waiting under an open sky with eight members of his family even as it rained heavily. They had no tarpaulin to spread over their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, &quot;We started walking to Bangladesh from Buchidaung of Rakhine on August 26 and reached here today evening. We have no food or no money to buy food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fatema Khatun, 65, wife of Nurus Salam, hailing from Marullah of Maungdaw, has taken shelter at the Kutupalong registered refugee camp in Ukhiya. She told The Independent on Thursday, &quot;We came here along with 14 members of my family, including my three daughters. We are yet to receive any food or water. We are living on some biscuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeakub Nabi and Kaim Molla, both putting up at the same camp, narrated a similar tale of woe. About 40,000 new Rohingyas entrants have taken shelter at two camps run by the UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After crossing the border, we are waiting here for three days. Now we are fasting. My two sons are crying for food, they are very hungry,&quot; said Ansar Begum, 27, who hailed from Shilkhali at Shaplapara in Teknaf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked, Vivian Tan, spokesperson of the UNHCR, told The Independent at the Kutupalong camp, &quot;We are surprised seeing such an influx. After assessment of the situation and the number of the arrivals and their demands, we will appeal for funds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are giving food to the people who took shelter in our camps,&quot; said Joseph Tripura, spokesman of UNHCR Bangladesh. Now thousands of Rohingya are staying on Teknaf roads. They are seen begging for food and water from pedestrians. The locals are trying to help them with food, but no aid agencies are around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rohingyas at Raikhong, a hilly, makeshift camp in Ukhiya, where over 60,000 of them have taken shelter, said, the UN Immigration for Migration (IOM) distributed 3,000 tarpaulins and has also provided medical assistance with the help of Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rohingyas who have taken shelter by the roadside, the local school and madrasha said no representative of any agencies had come to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacted, Khaled Mahmud, additional district magistrate of Cox's Bazar district, told The Independent, &quot;The aid agencies are not working as per expectation in feeding the helpless people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMAGINE if the entire population of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport had no UK citizenship and the army and government decided to drive them out of the UK, murdering, raping and torturing some of them as they did so, all in the space of a few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well that's what has happened to the Rohingya people from Rakhine Province in Burma, since the end of August this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has described the Rohingya people the most persecuted community in the world, yet very little has been done about their plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been successive waves of displacement of the Rohingya into Bangladesh since 1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to August 2017, nearly 200,000 people had fled to Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the speed and scale of over 650,000 refugees from an estimated total Rohingya population of 1.2 million since 25th August this year has been unprecedented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I represent Cardiff Central, the most diverse constituency in Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a large British Bangladeshi diaspora in Cardiff Central and I had been watching this humanitarian crisis unfold with horror, as had many of my constituents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lots of them contacted me, distressed and angry about what was happening and the lack of action by the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wanted to see the situation for myself, to speak to politicians and aid workers but, most importantly, the Rohingya people themselves, about what was going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So in November, I visited the refugee camp at Kutupalong in the Cox's Bazar area of Bangladesh on a factfinding mission with a small group of parliamentarians, organised by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). I've seen some pretty awful places over the years; slums in India and the inside of Colombian prisons to name just two, but nothing could have prepared me for the shock of Kutupalong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I stood on a hill in the camp in the searing heat and looked out as far as the eye can see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From where I was standing right to the horizon was a mass of humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have never seen anything like it and I hope I will never see anything like it again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was viewing only a small section of the camp though. It covers 3000 acres and every day, more people arrive having fled ethnic cleansing, brutal murder and sexual violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the few days before I visited, there had been 5,000 new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to describe this living hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What shocked me most were the sheer numbers of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 60% of the refugees are children and many of them have been become separated from their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is very little food, mainly just rice, and many people are suf-fering from malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's little or no sanitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People sleep, cook, eat and defecate in tiny haphazard shelters, most of which are just a small piece of plastic and some canes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw one family of about a dozen - they had taken in and looked after children who had lost their parents - living in an area of about 10 square feet - on the side of the dirt track with nothing other than a piece of tarpaulin over them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw UN aid workers organising distribution of shelter packs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were a plastic sack containing some plastic, sticks, a blanket and jerry can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were given to refugees with a priority need because there aren't enough packs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But every person in the camp has desperate needs and this rationing is heartbreaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once a pack had been collected, it is a herculean task to then find any space to erect a shelter. People have to walk miles and miles to find just 10 square feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a severe lack of clean drinking water. People don't have clean water to drink, never mind water to wash in or cook with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk of fire is substantial and would rip through the camp at speed with nowhere for people to escape to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is very limited medical help and so many of the refugees are seriously injured and traumatised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I met one man who had been beaten and tortured by the Burmese military and as a result, had spinal injuries and was paralysed from the waist down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends had carried him for miles to reach the border to cross to some sort of safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was stick thin and in severe pain, but just grateful to be alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sexual violence has been widespread and horrific. Women and children I met were clearly traumatised and the fear in their faces is something I'll never forget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers are increasingly concerned about the risk of trafficking and sexual exploitation. The most powerful memory I have of visiting the camp is the young mother who had given birth to her daughter just a few days previously. She slowly beckoned me into a tent where some of the most obviously severely injured refugees are taken on arrival and unwrapped her baby from some dirty rags on the floor and showed her to me with such pride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I looked at the baby struggling to hold back tears. What chance did that child have of any sort of life? But then I heard about the mothers who babies had been snatched from them by Burmese soldiers, thrown to the ground, stamped on and then thrown onto fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I realised later that day that this baby was lucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She had been born over the border in Bangladesh, not in Burma. So there is a tiny piece of hope for her. The Bangladeshi government have done everything they possibly can to try to cope with this humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Families in Cox's Bazar have opened their homes to over 50,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bangladesh itself is overpopulated, has poor infrastructure and as the cyclone season approaches, there is a real risk that the camp and surrounding area could be decimated with loss of hundreds of thousands of lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh cannot cope alone. It needs concerted international action to provide both immediate help, but also to stop this genocide by the Burmese military and shamefully condoned by the Burmese government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after I returned from Bangladesh, I met the UK Foreign Office Minister and the Bangladeshi High Commissioner to describe what I had seen and to outline what I thought the UK government should do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have followed this up by speaking in Parliament about what I saw and questioning the Minister on further action and diplomatic efforts with Burma and UN Security Council members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More aid is urgently needed. Food, clean water, sanitation, healthcare and, if the Rohingya children are likely to be in camps for more than the very short term, which seems inevitable, education needs to be provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bangladesh and Burmese governments reached an agreement in late November to potentially repatriate the refugees but the details of that agreement have been kept secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must not be forced return and even if a voluntary return programme is established, there must be guarantees and safeguards in place to ensure that no-one is at risk of violence or death and they have safe accommodation to return to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hard line Burmese military have got what they wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not just to prevent the Rohingya from having legal status as citizens, but to physically eradicate them from Burma altogether through sheer brutality and force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK and the international community cannot stand by and let this continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burmese military cannot be allowed to get away with this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they do, it sets a precedent for the future for any country to wipe out a minority population with impunity. As well as increasing the amount of aid to the refugees, the UK Government should support a referral for genocide of the Head of the Burmese military to the International Criminal Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Government should also push for the EU to implement sanctions against Burma and there should be a UN mandated global arms embargo against Burma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what can we do to help? Ask your MP to ask the UK Government to support the requests I have made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are able to donate to the relief effort please do whatever you can. UNICEF, Save the Children and United Purpose are all raising funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My British Bangladeshi constituents and many others across Cardiff have been fundraising through the Bangladeshi Association Cardiff and have raised over &pound;30,000 to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can help give that new born baby girl the chance of a future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee advocates fear violence will erupt on Manus Island as the final countdown begins to the closure of an Australian offshore detention centre holding 600 asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men are refusing to leave the centre at the Lombrum Navy Base despite its planned closure on Tuesday amid fears they won't be safe at three other facilities they are meant to relocate to in and around the island's main town of Lorengau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many locals in the town have threatened to use violence to stop the asylum seekers relocating, prompting Papua New Guinea authorities to deploy extra police to the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile dining facilities at Lombrum have closed, with the asylum seekers now relying on basic food parcels containing muesli bars, muffins, corn flakes and pre-cooked meals they've been told will last two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power and water are due to be cut off on Tuesday ahead of PNG's navy retaking control of the site a day later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Law Centre's legal advocacy director Daniel Webb says the situation on Manus is 'like a powder keg'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There are people who are tense and they are frightened,' he told AAP on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The refugees are terrified of violence if they stay inside the detention centre and if they leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Many local people are angry, particularly at the Australian government, so it's a disaster waiting to happen.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger has been building among locals at Lorengau over a lack of consultation about the facility to house some of the asylum seekers in a residential area on the town's outskirts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor of Manus Island Charlie Benjamin has warned that many locals feared they would be in danger and were threatening to arm themselves with knives and other weapons to stop any of the 600 men moving in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia expects the Lombrum centre will close as planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Everything is proceeding at this point,' a spokesman for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told AAP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration Department Secretary Michael Pezzullo told a Senate committee last week that it was a matter for the PNG government to decide whether the men would be removed by force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee Action Coalition's Ian Rintoul fears a siege situation could develop at the Lombrum centre ahead of Tuesday's deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There are some indications that locals would attempt to get food and water to them but it's on a (naval) base so that will mean some kind of confrontation one way or the other,' he told AAP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rintoul said two of the three centres earmarked for the asylum seekers were still not fenced or guarded, raising concerns about their safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Nobody's inclined to move,' he said. 'They would have transferred a long a time a go if they thought they could be safe.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lombrum centre's closure was announced after the PNG Supreme Court ruled in April 2016 that Australia's detention of refugees and asylum seekers there was illegal and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leaked transcript of the infamous phone call between U.S. President  Donald Trump  and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull  has emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosive nature of their first official telephone conversation in February was revealed in the transcript published in full by&nbsp; The Washington Post.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call bizarrely started with the president asking Mr Turnbull about champion golfer Greg Norman before it quickly devolved into a heated exchange about a U.S. agreement to accept refugees from Australian detention centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad,' Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull, according to the transcript.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull tried to clarify the detainees on Manus Island and Nauru were in fact economic refugees and not criminals before Mr Trump interjected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Maybe you should let them out of prison. I am doing this because Obama made a bad deal. I am not doing this because it fits into my executive order,' he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am taking 2,000 people from Australia who are in prison and the day before I signed an executive order saying that we are not taking anybody in. We are not taking anybody in, those days are over.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull explained Australia's policy was to stop people smugglers and said even a Nobel Prize winner would not be allowed into the country if they arrived by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rare moment of harmony, Mr Trump responded: 'That is a good idea. We should do that too. You are worse than I am.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president went on to label the U.S. refugee deal as 'stupid' and claimed it would make him 'look terrible' in his first week in the White House.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Does anybody know who these people are? Who are they? Where do they come from?' Mr Trump asked, before questioning if a refugee accepted into the country could 'become the Boston bomber in five years'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think it is a horrible deal, a disgusting deal that I would have never made. As far as I am concerned, that is enough, Malcolm. I have had it,' the president said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister, apparently struggling to get a word in and at one point pleading for the president to 'hear him out', tried to turn the conversation to Syria or North Korea.&nbsp;But Mr Trump refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call ended abruptly as Mr Turnbull thanked the president for his commitment before telling him: 'You can count on me. I will be there again and again.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I hope so. OK, thank you Malcolm,' the president said before the call ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     TRUMP AND TURNBULL SPAR OVER DEAL                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told US President Donald Trump during their heated January phone call America did not have to accept any of the refugees held on Nauru or Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A full transcript of their call was leaked to the Washington Post and published on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They chatted about a mutual acquaintance, Australian golf great Greg Norman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I guess our friend Greg Norman, he is doing very well?' Mr Trump asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He is a great mutual friend, yes,' Mr Turnbull responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pleasantries, however, soon evaporated as Mr Turnbull firmly pushed Mr Trump to accept the Nauru-Manus Island refugee deal Australia struck in 2016 with then US president Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transcript shows how Mr Turnbull corralled Mr Trump into publicly endorsing the deal to consider accepting 1250 refugees, but also offered a way for the president not to accept a single person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull, with plenty of political stock invested in getting the deal done, pushed Mr Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am asking you as a very good friend,' Mr Turnbull said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is a big deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is really, really important to us that we maintain it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull explained the deal was for 1250 to 2000 refugees, but added Mr Trump in the end, after vetting, would not have to take any refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You can decide to take them or to not take them after vetting,' Mr Turnbull told Mr Trump, according to the transcript.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You can decide to take 1000 or 100. It is entirely up to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The obligation is to only go through the process.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull also said: 'I say this to you sincerely that it is in the mutual interest of the United States to say, 'Yes, we can conform with that deal - we are not obliged to take anybody we do not want, we will go through extreme vetting' and that way you are seen to show the respect that a trusted ally wants and deserves.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump said the deal 'is going to kill me' and 'makes me look so bad'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another exchange Mr Trump asked Mr Turnbull: 'Suppose I vet them closely and I do not take any?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull responded: 'That is the point I have been trying to make.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump: 'How does that help you?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull: 'Well, we assume that we will act in good faith.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump was not happy, but eventually conceded he will accept the deal originally agreed upon last year between Mr Turnbull and then US president Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Malcolm, why is this so important?' Mr Trump asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I do not understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is going to kill me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And now I am agreeing to take 2000 people and I agree I can vet them, but that puts me in a bad position.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull responded: 'With great respect, that is not right - It is not 2000.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump replied: 'Well, it is close. I have also heard like 5000 as well.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull: 'The given number in the agreement is 1250 and it is entirely a matter of your vetting.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull the agreement was 'a horrible deal, a disgusting deal', would make him look like a 'dope', 'a weak and ineffective leader', and he feared the refugees would turn into terrorists who would pull off San Bernardino or World Trade Center-style terror attacks in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull: 'Thank you for your commitment. It is very important to us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump fired back: 'It is important to you and it is embarrassing to me. It is an embarrassment to me, but at least I got you off the hook. So you put me back on the hook.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull: 'You can count on me. I will be there again and again.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump ended the call early, just 24 minutes into the 60 minutes allotted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call was Mr Trump's last of numerous calls with world leaders on January 28, including with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'As far as I am concerned, that is enough Malcolm,' Mr Trump said, ending the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have had it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Putin was a pleasant call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is ridiculous.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull then asked: 'Do you want to talk about Syria and DPRK?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump responded: 'This is crazy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull: 'Thank you for your commitment. It is very important to us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump fired back: 'It is important to you and it is embarrassing to me. It is an embarrassment to me, but at least I got you off the hook. So you put me back on the hook.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull replied: 'You can count on me. I will be there again and again.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump replied: 'I hope so. Okay, thank you Malcolm.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Okay, thank you.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OXFAM is calling for the UK to do more to help those fleeing South Sudan as the number of people escaping across the border into Uganda will reach one million in the coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity, working with refugees running from the conflict in South Sudan - where brutal fighting between government and opposition forces has been ongoing since 2013 - said that the crisis demanded the international community to step up its efforts. South Sudan's farmlands have reportedly been turned into &quot;killing fields&quot; with civilians shot, killed with machetes and burnt in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam, which provides water and sanitation projects in Uganda's Bidi Bidi refugee camp, with a population of over 270,000 people making it the largest in the world, said that richer countries should also offer resettlement places for vulnerable refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK could play its part by reuniting separated families, it claimed. Children in Uganda can be vulnerable to traffickers and people smugglers and may end up in the UK without their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month SNP MP Angus MacNeil launched a private members bill that would see UK law changed to give refugee children the right to be reunited with their parents. Under current reunion rules children cannot sponsor their parents to come to Britain, leaving them alone here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Development Secretary Priti Patel has called on those in power in South Sudan to end the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UK Government spokesperson said: &quot;The UK has consistently been clear that the crisis in South Sudan is man-made and the government of South Sudan must end it. The International Development Secretary firmly told President Kiir during a visit to see the situation on the ground that the fighting must stop and aid be allowed to reach people in desperate need so they do not starve to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UK is a world leader in responding to the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan and Uganda. We were one of the first to respond to the UN's appeal, stepping up support in less than 24 hours and providing a lifeline to hundreds of thousands of people fleeing violence and starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is giving vulnerable people hope for a future in the region so they are not forced to make perilous journeys in search of a better life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking exclusively to The National, Oxfam Scotland advocacy worker Sara Cowan, who has been working in and around Bidi Bidi in for the last three months, said people were suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People speak about fighting breaking out in the village when the women are in the farms and they just run when the gunshots start. Children have had to run when fighting has broken out around their schools. Families have been separated from each other, which is desperately difficult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reunion does happen - Cowan witnessed one mother volunteering with an Oxfam project reunite with her children after many months of searching. For others the process can be more traumatic and it can be hard for parents separated from their children to know if they are alive or dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda has one of the most generous refugee policies in Africa, and arguably the world. Refugees are registered at the border and transported to settlements where they are initially given a hot meal and a space to sleep. Each family is then allocated a 30 x 30m plot and given emergency shelter materials, access to a latrine and food rations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet life is incredibly tough. Many arrive traumatised by past experiences and with nothing but the clothes they stand up in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Temporary school structures are easily damaged by wind and rain and teachers are in short supply, meaning children's education is suffering and work can be almost impossible for refugees to secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cowan added: &quot;The UK Government could definitely do more, for example to ensure that children are automatically entitled to be reunited with their parents if they become separated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to see governments taking a positive stance on refugees in their own countries as well as supporting those shouldering the burden such as Uganda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angus MacNeil MP said: &quot;We can see from the work of Oxfam and the difficult situation faced by people in Bidi Bidi the extent of the difficulties that people can face in being separated from their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to bring UK law in line with other countries and make sure that the very natural impulse to be reunited is not blocked by bureaucracy. At the moment the law is inhumane.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the surface, at least, Yamen Alahmad was a model refugee, a Syrian teenager apparently motivated only by the hope of starting a new life far from the hell of his homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, however, Germany's anti-terrorism police kicked in the door to the flat the state had granted him in the northern city of Schwerin. The officers had evidence that Alahmad was building a bomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if more evidence were needed of the terrorist threat facing Europe, the 19-year-old had arrived in Germany as an unaccompanied minor at the peak of the migrant crisis in 2015, becoming one of the country's 1.6m registered asylum seekers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was charged with terrorism. Over the internet he had ordered electronic and chemical materials used in bomb making and he had been in contact with a self-styled &quot;soldier of the caliphate&quot; or Isis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intelligence sources have revealed to The Sunday Times that more than 9,000 suspected terrorist plots against European countries have been discovered in recent years. Many were foiled before the attackers reached Europe. But most of the recent cases are linked to the migration of late 2015, when Germany opened its borders to Syrian and other refugees to avoid a humanitarian emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then police have received more than 1,900 reliable tip-offs about terrorists among the refugee population. More than 70 investigations are under way, with authorities carrying out an average of three to four house searches a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of America's considerable intelligence resources in Germany are focusing on terrorist threats, a majority of them emanating from migrant communities. Germany, say intelligence sources, has become Europe's prime &quot;terror hub&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This newspaper was the first to reveal how most of the Paris attackers in 2015 had hidden among the wave of refugees to penetrate Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Isis facing defeat in Syria, many more are likely to travel by boat from Libya or Egypt to Europe, according to the intelligence sources whose electronic surveillance tools are trained on the route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's National Security Agency is monitoring mobile phones and social media to alert its European counterparts to potential attackers. Such intelligence led to the arrest of Alahmad, who was placing orders on Amazon for materials to make triacetone triperoxide, the explosive of choice for Isis terrorists. Amazon helpfully added that customers who bought detonators also bought acetone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's FBI reportedly helped German authorities to secure Alahmad's &quot;chat protocols&quot; from Facebook, allowing them to eavesdrop on his preparations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the German authorities have evidence that about 25 Isis terrorists have infiltrated the stream of refugees to attack Europe, the majority of those arrested recently - including Alahmad - are young men who became radicalised in Germany after communicating with Isis handlers over social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alahmad, like tens of thousands of other migrants, was granted asylum in 2016 without even being interviewed by authorities - he just had to fill out a form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than two-thirds of the 1.6m refugees in Germany are male and more than half arrived without any form of identification, according to official estimates. About 230,000 rejected asylum seekers have been marked for deportation, but the lack of documents makes it difficult for the authorities to remove them from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This poses a security threat for the rest of Europe, as migrants who reach Germany can move freely across the borderless Schengen zone. Thousands have disappeared without trace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Altmaier, Germany's refugee co-ordinator and acting finance minister, said the lack of information about people entering and leaving the European Union was part of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also admitted, however, that Germany had no oversight of its own migrant population. &quot;No one knows exactly how many asylum seekers have left Germany and Europe without being registered,&quot; Altmaier told the Bild newspaper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is to spend &pound;1.9 billion of foreign aid cash on looking after asylum seekers and refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount the Home Office plans to shell out could fund 82,745 new police officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wants to maintain the current level of support given to those seeking refuge in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it has already told the Daily Express the &quot;majority&quot; of the &pound;362 million it contributes to the bloated budget each year is swallowed up supporting migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But projected spending on Official Development Assistance until 2021 means taxpayers will continue to shoulder the burden of &quot;refugee programmes&quot;, providing bed and board for tens of thousands of newcomers, many of whom have arrived here illegally.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The billions of pounds of public money spent on ODA has prompted 70,000 Daily Express readers to back our Stop The Foreign Aid Madness Crusade demanding the Government urgently redirects money into struggling frontline services such as the NHS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK is committed to spending 0.7 per cent of our national income on foreign aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year it cost taxpayers &pound;13.3 billion. But cross-party concern has been raised that it is being used to support economic migrants and not those in genuine need of sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukip deputy leader Margot Parker said: &quot;For this amount of taxpayers' cash to be paying for asylum seekers almost beggars belief. The Government should stop this cavalier squandering of our cash. There is a Budget coming up - let's see some action to scale back on this spending and use the money to cure many of the problems facing the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukip deputy leader Margot Parker said she wanted to see 'some action to scale back on this spending'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday managers of hospital and ambulance trusts across England claimed staff shortages in the overrun NHS pose a serious risk to patient safety and quality of care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NHS is on the cusp of a recruitment crisis with an estimated shortage of at least 50,000 doctors and nurses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our campaign is calling for money to be redirected into the services on which millions of people rely but which teeter on the brink of collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MP David Davies said: &quot;Far too many economic migrants are trying to come to the UK simply for a better life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wants money spent on asylum seekers directed to refugee camps across North Africa to discourage thousands from risking their lives trying to reach Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Davis said he wants money spent on asylum seekers directed to refugee camps  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents show planned spending on ODA would see the Home Office fork out &pound;1.94 billion to &quot;maintain the current refugee programmes and provide assistance on new areas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department, run by Home Secretary Amber Rudd and responsible for securing our borders from illegal immigration, confirmed the lion's share of its foreign aid commitment is spent on asylum support and the Syrian Vulnerable People Resettlement Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme aims to relocate 20,000 Syrian refugees from camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt and Turkey by 2020. Even those who have reached the UK illegally are provided with a place to live, a cash allowance or both while claims are processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current rules see each individual pocket &pound;36.95 a week with those who have been refused asylum getting &pound;35.39 on a payment card for food, clothing and toiletries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claimants also get free NHS treatment while their children are found school places and given free meals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office said: &quot;The UK has a long and proud history of granting asylum to those who genuinely need our protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that more than 8,500 people had been resettled so far - half of whom were children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said: &quot;We also support projects to build the capacity and capability of countries to deal with border security, drug smuggling, modern slavery and child protection online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is in our interest to help tackle these issues abroad so as to lessen their impact in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
