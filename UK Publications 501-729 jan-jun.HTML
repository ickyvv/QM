</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump slammed Malcolm Turnbull over a proposed asylum seeker deal and accused the Australian Prime Minister of looking to ship off the 'next Boston bombers' to the United States during their first official telephone conversation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday afternoon the newly-elected president took to Twitter to slam the Obama administration for agreeing to take on the refugees in the first place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!,' he wrote.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior US officials told the Washington Post &nbsp;that Donald Trump abruptly hung up on Mr Turnbull after just 25 minutes - when the pair were meant to speak for an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an indignant Mr Turnbull returned serve, telling 2GB's Ben Fordham: 'As far as the call is concerned, I'm very disappointed, the report the president hung up is not correct, the call ended courteously.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fuming President Trump reportedly told Mr Turnbull that the conversation was 'the worst call by far' he had taken that day, after 'boasting' about pleasant exchanges with Russian President Vladimir Putin and three other world leaders.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump reportedly ranted about the deal the Obama administration struck with Canberra to take 1250 genuine refugees from Nauru and Manus Island, telling Mr Turnbull: 'I don't want these people'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the 'worst deal ever', he told the prime minister, complaining he was 'going to get killed' politically for following through on the resettlement agreement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News sources claim President Trump was 'yelling' at Mr Turnbull at points during the heated conversation, which took place on Saturday afternoon Washington time, Sunday morning Australian time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         What is the Australia-US refugee deal?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration and Turnbull government struck a deal to resettle some of the refugees being held offshore in Nauru and Manus Island in November last year&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has a 'zero tolerance' policy towards illegal boat arrivals and only genuine refugees are sent to Nauru and Manus Island&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are approximately 1,250 refugees being held in the Australian-funded offshore detention centres</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large majority of those refugees come from Iran, Iraq and Somalia - all countries on US President Donald Trump's travel-ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump reportedly agreed to honour the deal, on the condition the refugees would undergo 'extreme vetting'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US President reportedly described it as the 'worst deal ever' in a heated conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump indicated he was sceptical about what America got out of honouring the deal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr Turnbull apparently suggested they move on and talk about foreign affairs, including the conflict in Syria, President Trump ended the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'During call with Australian PM on refugees, Trump pulled phone away from ear and says he wants off call, which ends abruptly per source,' CNN reporter Jim Acosta tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement reached with the Obama administration, Australian would take a number of South American refugees, currently in a processing center in Costa Rica, in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These refugees are predominantly Christian, according to reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to revelations of the hostile phone conversation, Mr Turnbull remained tight-lipped on Thursday and said that he wasn't going to comment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's better that these things - these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News reporter Laura Jayes said Australian government sources who took part in discussions after the call said Mr Turnbull viewed the president as a 'bully'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What I derived from that was Malcolm Turnbull used this phone call to push back,' Ms Jayes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He wasn't just sitting there being berated by Donald Trump, he talked about how important it was for (Trump) to honour the deal.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosive report is a huge embarrassment for Mr Turnbull, who has insisted in recent days the asylum seeker deal is solid and relations with Washington are fine.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and Australia have been close military and economic allies for generations, with Australian troops fighting alongside Americans in every military conflict Washington has been involved in since World War II.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is one of just four other countries the US shares security intelligence with under the Five Eyes alliance. The two countries have also shared a free trade agreement since 2005.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official statement about the phone call released by the White House told a different story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Both leaders emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally,' it said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull on Monday described the call as constructive, saying the pair acknowledged the already strong and deep relationship between the US and Australia and committed to making it stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That's my job. My job is to defend the national interest of Australia and defend the interests of Australians,' he told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You may wish to speculate about policies and politics in Washington, that's not my role. My job is today and everyday to stand up for Australia and that's what I do.&nbsp;'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also thanked the president for 'committing' to honour the refugee agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1.30pm (AEDT) on Thursday the US Embassy in Australia released a statement that the deal would go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'President Trump's decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed and Spokesman Spicer's comments stand,' a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this Embassy at 13:15 Canberra time.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it came after a morning of mixed messages from various official sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday it was reported that the White House had backtracked on the asylum seeker deal, saying that President Trump was still considering it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said the deal had not been confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if it were to go ahead, it would only be because of the United States' 'longstanding relationship with Australia,'&nbsp; The ABC  reported.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         'Cruel, inhuman and degrading': UN hits out over 'open-air prison'                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has been heavily criticized by the UN for its policy of sending migrants to offshore detention centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November UN investigator Francois Crepeau visited the island of Nauru, where asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent, and described conditions as 'cruel, inhuman and degrading'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Crapeau said Australia's policies 'have increasingly eroded the human rights of migrants in contravention of its international human rights and humanitarian obligations'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he continued: 'Australia would vehemently protest if its citizens were treated like this by other counties and especially if Australian children were treated like this.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International said in October that the immigration center was an 'open-air prison'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes just one day after Mr Spicer told reporters Mr Trump would honour the 'one-off' deal with former President Barack Obama in November to resettle refugees detained on Manus and Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Part of the deal is they have to be vetted in the same manner that we are doing now.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Mr Trump placed a temporary ban on refugees being admitted to the US and other strict border measures targeting seven countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr Trump confirmed his administration would continue to honour the 2016 refugee resettlement arrangement while acknowledging a common interest in preventing irregular and illegal migration.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The president, in accordance with that deal to honour what had been agreed upon by the US government, and ensuring that vetting will take place in the same manner that we are doing it now, it will go forward,' Mr Spicer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are being held on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and Nauru.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters at the G'day USA gala in Hollywood, Ms Bishop said Mr Turnbull would travel to the US for a yet to be scheduled meeting with the president.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'President Trump's decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed and Spokesman Spicer's comments stand,' a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this Embassy at 13:15 Canberra time.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it came after a morning of mixed messages from various official sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday it was reported that the White House had backtracked on the asylum seeker deal, saying that President Trump was still considering it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said the deal had not been confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if it were to go ahead, it would only be because of the United States' 'longstanding relationship with Australia,'&nbsp; The ABC  reported.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes just one day after Mr Spicer told reporters Mr Trump would honour the 'one-off' deal with former President Barack Obama in November to resettle refugees detained on Manus and Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Part of the deal is they have to be vetted in the same manner that we are doing now. There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Mr Trump placed a temporary ban on refugees being admitted to the US and other strict border measures targeting seven countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr Trump confirmed his administration would continue to honour the 2016 refugee resettlement arrangement while acknowledging a common interest in preventing irregular and illegal migration.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The president, in accordance with that deal to honour what had been agreed upon by the US government, and ensuring that vetting will take place in the same manner that we are doing it now, it will go forward,' Mr Spicer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are being held on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and Nauru.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters at the G'day USA gala in Hollywood, Ms Bishop said Mr Turnbull would travel to the US for a yet to be scheduled meeting with the president.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malala Yousafzai, the 19-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is the latest to join a chorus of critics against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, with Jewish groups also raising outcry over the timing of the move.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war,' Yousafzai said in a statement on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yousafzai, a British resident, drew global acclaim as a human rights activist when, in Pakistan at age 15, she was shot in the head by Taliban assassins over her advocacy for women's education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants,' the young activist said of Trump's recent immigration order, which bans refugee entries to the U.S. for the next four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Scroll down for video</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In this time of uncertainty and unrest around the world, I ask President Trump not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families,' the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A wide range of Jewish groups were also outspoken about the immigration order, which went into effect on Friday, the anniversary of the Allied liberation of the Nazi's Auschwitz concentration camp.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The date is memorialized as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is a terrible irony that today, the same day on which this order is to be signed, is also International Holocaust Remembrance Day,' the liberal Jewish group J Street said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The fact that President Trump's order appears designed to specifically limit the entry of Muslims evokes horrible memories among American Jews of the shameful period leading up to World War Two, when the United States failed to provide a safe haven for the vast majority of Jews in Europe trying to escape Nazi persecution,' the statement said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's ban puts a 90-day pause on visas and immigration from seven countries including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also puts a 120-day ban on all refugee entries into the country and declares that refugees from Syria are not welcome until further notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'History will look back on this order as a sad moment in American history - the time when the president turned his back on people fleeing for their lives,' Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Yes, we need strict screening but our current system is sufficient in keeping America safe,' Greenblatt added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president addressed the topic of the Holocaust in a statement acknowledging Holocaust remembrance day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror,' he said Friday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's immigration order&nbsp;declares that U.S. policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also&nbsp;gives Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year, according to the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ANTI-IMMIGRATION ORDER DO?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban refugee entries from all countries for 120 days. Refugees can be accepted on case-by-case basis, including&nbsp;if they are a religious minority facing religious persecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Block refugee entries from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap refugee intake at 50,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban visa and immigration entries for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries on banned list, including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspend visa issuance to countries of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order declares that the U.S. will 'prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution.'&nbsp;But that only applies when 'the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visa, green card holders and refugees had already been blocked from entering the United States just hours after Trump signed an executive order introducing his tough new immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were stopped from boarding a flight from Cairo on Saturday, while at least two Iraqis were detained after flying in to New York's JFK airport on Friday night.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Iraqi refugees, including one who had worked for the U.S. government in Iraq for 10 years, were detained at New York's JFK airport on Friday, The New York Times &nbsp;reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men were on separate flights when immigration officials stopped them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One was released on Saturday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations refugee agency and International Organization for Migration (IOM) called on Donald Trump's administration to continue offering asylum to people fleeing war and persecution, saying its resettlement programme was vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plea came after Mr Trump signed an executive order closing US borders to all refugees for a period of at least four months, as well as banning any travellers from six Muslim-majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,&quot; Trump said as he signed the order at the Pentagon late on Friday. &quot;We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order, which came into force as soon as Mr Trump signed it, requires US border officials to turn away any traveller from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for the next 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There order was followed &nbsp;by reports&nbsp;of travellers who had been issued visas for travel being turned away or told not to board flights because of the ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It imposes a 120-day suspension the US refugee resettlement programme, regardless of applicants' country of origin, while administration officials develop additional vetting procedures and decide which countries those procedures are &quot;adequate&quot; to ensure safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order suspended a resettlement programme that allowed 85,000 people fleeing war, hunger, and political or religious persecution, to be resettled in the US last year. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Ryan, the republican speaker of the House, said it was &quot;time to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Democrats decried the move as &quot;un-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move was met with dismay around the world, with the UNHCR and the IOM warning that it could have a critical impact on the world's most vulnerable people at a time of global crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the U.S. resettlement programme is one of the most important in the world,&quot; the two Geneva-based agencies said in a joint statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies hoped &quot;that the US will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 25,000 refugees were resettled in the United States between October and year-end under UNHCR's programme for the most vulnerable, the agency said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said it would file a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the executive order on Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 226 asylum seekers have lost their lives attempting to reach Europe so far this year - more than double the figure for the same period in 2016 -and many more remain at risk as rough seas and the extreme cold continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greek border police had to dig through more than a metre of snow to find the body of one man who died after crossing over the River Evros near the Turkish border -one of several asylum seekers to be killed by sub-zero temperatures in recent weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 500 refugees rescued in single day as crisis continues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees freezing to death in extreme conditions across Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials found two suspected smugglers nearby with seven other asylum seekers, including one who was still wearing wet clothes and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were discovered near Feres, where the land border between Turkey and Greece is being used by migrants diverted from crossing the Aegean Sea by the controversial EU-Turkey deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It followed the deaths of two Iraqi men and a Somaliwoman in snow-covered Bulgarian mountains, and another Afghan man in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said refugees had also been killed by hypothermia while in flimsy dinghies launched from North Africa towards Italy, with three bodies found inside a boat rescued and taken to Lampedusa at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, at least 180 migrants drowned when their vessel capsized in rough seas around 30 miles from the Libyan coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death toll was originally believed to stand at around 105 but interviews with survivors have revealed that the boat was larger and more crowded than initially thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a handful or survivors were found in search operations by ships including Italian Navy vessels, which recovered the bodies of eight migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the circumstances of the shipwreck will be further explained when the survivors are brought ashore, it seems likely that this incident resulted in the death of over 100 people,&quot; said Federico Soda, from the IOM in Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We still do not know the nationalities or if there were women or children on board. It is a tragic start to the new year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,100 rescued people, mostly from Western Africa, were taken ashore on the Italian islands of Lampedusa and Sicily on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee crisis: More than 500 migrants rescued in asingle day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivors told IOM workers they attempted the sea crossing to flee violence and abuses in Libya, feeling they had no option but to put themselves in the hands of smugglers who forced them onto boats in treacherous sea conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people have told us that when they get to the beach, those who change their mind and don't want to go are forced to get on board, sometimes with violence,&quot; said Ms Soda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 25 more refugees are believed to have drowned attempting to cross from Morocco to Spain, with several bodies washing up over the weekend. Two women and a baby are among those reported missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just over 3,000 asylum seekers, mostly from Syria, Afghanistan and Nigeria, have entered Europe so far this year according to UN figures, compared to more than 73,000 in July 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But death rates have been rocketing since the Central Mediterranean became the main route following attempts to stop comparatively shorter and safer crossings over the Aegean Sea by detaining anyone arriving on Greek islands under threats of deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of migrants are still being held in makeshift tent camps, with several being covered in snow, sparking emergency measures from Greek authorities aiming to find safer accommodation in empty hotels or on a navy ship.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rescue workers warn that people will continue to arrive as the crisis shows no sign of slowing in the Central Mediterranean, which has become the deadliest sea crossing in the world since the start of the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 550 refugees were rescued on Friday alone off the coast of Libya, where continuing conflict and lawlessness since the British-backed defeat of Muammar Gaddafi has allowed the smuggling and exploitation of migrants to thrive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories of the refugees rescued from the Mediterranean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 5,000 refugees were drowned, suffocated or crushed while attempting to cross the Mediterranean and Aegean seas in 2016, making it the deadliest year on record -a tragic benchmark 2017 is already on course to beat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Unravelling the Mediterranean Migration Crisisproject partly blamed Britain and EU nations for spiralling death rates, concluding that the refusal to open up legal routes for those seeking safety in Europe has increased demand for people smuggling on ever more dangerous routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operations to combat the thriving trade have driven the use of smaller and less seaworthy boats, which are harder forships patrolling as part of the EU's Operation Sophia and authorities in north Africa to spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poorly-made dinghies are now being loaded with more than 150 people a time, creating the risk of sinkings, capsizings or the inflatable bursting under the strain, as well as deadly fuel spills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 3,000 migrants and refugees have arrived by sea in Europe so far this year. The vast majority of those arriving in Italy are from countries including Nigeria, Eritrea and Guinea, while most of the much lower number of asylum seekers reaching Greek islands are predominantly Syrian, Afghan or Iraqi.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH the political drama in Britain dominating the news it would be easy to think that the mass migration from North Africa to Europe had all but ceased. After all, the EU did a deal with Turkey last year in which Turkey agreed to take back migrants who had made the short dash across the Aegean in return for European countries agreeing to take an equal number of Syrian refugees from camps in Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as many British tourists who head to the Mediterranean over the next few weeks will discover, the Turkey deal has not ended the problem. On other routes the migration continues apace. In just four days 9,000 migrants have arrived in Italy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides that, a new migration route has been established between Morocco and Spain, which over the past week has seen 1,000 arrivals. Tragically, as in Greece, bodies are beginning to wash up on Spanish beaches. Across the Mediterranean as a whole 2,000 are estimated to have drowned this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot go on tolerating this human tragedy. As in Greece we must find a humane way of stopping people boarding boats in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy yesterday made a start by threatening to close its ports to non-Italian-registered, migrant-carrying ships. Many of these vessels are operated by charities which, while wellmeaning, are thoroughly misguided. Italy's move is certainly a beginning, although Europe needs a co-ordinated approach to go further still and shut down these migration routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT GOES without saying that we can and must continue to do whatever we can to search for these boats and to rescue their human cargos. But once migrants have been saved from the unseaworthy vessels they have boarded in North African countries they should in almost all cases be returned to the countries from whence they set sail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we must stop doing, on the other hand, is providing a ferry service across the Mediterranean. What happens at the moment is that migrants saved from sinking boats a few miles off the North African coast are then being brought the rest of the way to Europe in safety. By providing this service we are encouraging a criminal racket which has caused a huge number of deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some in Britain who romanticise the great migration across the Mediterranean, who see the migrants as heroes who, if allowed to, will become enterprising and patriotic citizens of Europe. In some cases this is no doubt true but it shouldn't detract from the fact that the migration is run by criminal gangs who care not one jot for their victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will tackle these traffickers only by closing down their business. Instead we are colluding with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another common fallacy that all those who attempt to make it to Europe are refugees. Some arriving from Syria or the lawless parts of chaotic, post-Gaddafi Libya certainly do deserve that description. Others may have started their journeys as refugees in places such as Somalia. But many others are more accurately described as economic migrants. Some of those arriving in Spain in recent months are reported to have come from Senegal, which is one of the most stable African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course many Senegalese could improve their lives and their health by migrating to European countries which offer a far better standard of living. But that is no basis for claiming asylum, which is supposed to be for people who are genuinely fleeing in fear of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we did recognise the right of people to settle wherever they liked, and to enjoy the full rights of citizenship, including access to welfare and healthcare, Europe would very quickly be overwhelmed. And while economic migrants were allowed to pursue a better life, genuine refugees would be forgotten. Ferrying migrants across the Mediterranean might be helping some refugees lucky enough to survive journeys in traffickers' boats but for too long Europe has been looking at the refugee problem from the wrong end of the telescope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate has become fixated on people crossing the Mediterranean and indeed the English Channel when we should really be asking what more could we do to help refugees much closer to the source of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THROUGHOUT the Syrian crisis Britain has followed by far the most logical and humane approach of any European country. We have contributed far more than any other to the running of refugee camps in countries bordering Syria, while at the same time erecting barriers to discourage migrant flows into Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a lot more that Europe could be doing to help refugees. Disgracefully the UN Food Programme had to reduce its operations in Lebanon for want of donations from wealthy countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We could certainly take more refugees from Syria but we should take them directly from camps in the Middle East. That way we ensure we are really helping refugees, not economic migrants, and also discourage the people traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year in its deal with Turkey the EU finally caught up with the logic. It is high time it went further and closed down the lethal trade in migrants across the Mediterranean for good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have to shut down the traffickers'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Poole</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOOKS; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">985 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the summer of 2015, and the refugee crisis is all over the news. Jonathan Dean, a film and music journalist, is prompted to delve for the first time into his own family history. His grandfather, Heinz Schapira, was a Jewish refugee from the Nazis, sent away as a teenager with his brother just before the outbreak of the second world war. And Heinz's father, David, had himself been a refugee from Ukraine in&nbsp;the previous war. What do their stories of European migration have to say to us today? &quot;Children fled Nazis in brogues,&quot; the author observes. &quot;Children flee Syria in&nbsp;Velcro trainers. Why are children still fleeing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dean quotes extensively from his relatives' own accounts: David wrote a memoir, and Heinz kept wartime diaries. Their stories are extraordinary: David Schapira was blinded fighting for the Germans in the first world war, and then sent to a concentration camp during the second; afterwards, he settled back in Vienna as though nothing had happened. His son Heinz, having escaped on a train (not officially an evacuation but similar), spent the&nbsp;war working as a farm labourer in Britain, before becoming a successful executive in the timber trade. (&quot;Very miserable day in rainy Reading,&quot; reads one of his diary entries, showing that some things never change.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dean also follows in their footsteps around Europe: in Cologne, through which Heinz passed on his way to London, he observes tourists &quot;taking pictures of what they are told to notice&quot;, and notes the complaints of sexual assault by newly arrived migrants. In Vienna he inspects Heinz's school report cards, and meets some of today's refugees. Yousef, a 16-year-old from Iraq, lives with his sister and mother in a single room. He thinks, with diplomatic optimism, the Austrians will be &quot;more welcoming soon&quot;. Dean also meets Adham, a 25-year-old from Damascus, who insists on paying for their coffees in an old-world Viennese cafe. Here the writer asks a brilliant question. On his entire journey from Syria to Austria, how many people did Adham meet who wanted to go to England? He thinks for a moment. &quot;One,&quot; he replies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet here we are, after a Brexit referendum widely interpreted, not least by the present prime minister, as indicating a wish to reduce immigration - though that was nowhere mentioned on the ballot paper, hence the interminable and fundamentally undecidable contests over what the vote really meant. Dean goes to a pretty home counties town where his family lived, which voted predominantly Leave and where Ukip is strong. These people don't like refugees, Dean thinks, looking at an old family photograph and wondering about the current owner of their former home. &quot;Who sits in the garden where a refugee stood proudly in 1981 with his refugee father?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dean is especially good on the ridiculous idea that there is just not enough room in the UK for more mig&shy;rants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of fear and loathing about a purportedly unsustainable influx of migrants is nothing new, of course. &quot;The way stateless Jews from Germany are pouring in from every port of this country is becoming an outrage,&quot; ran one British newspaper story in 1938. (Oddly, Dean does not name the newspaper in question: you will not be surprised to learn that it was the Daily Mail.) Dean is especially good on the ridiculous idea that there is just not enough room in the&nbsp;UK for more migrants. There is, of course, plenty of uninhabited space, even in the capital, as the author sees from the window of his daily train through east London. And yet, as he points out wonderingly, &quot;the idea Britain is full is no longer a shamefully racist thing&quot;. Near the end of the book he interviews Stella Creasy, his local MP, who puts the liberal point well in vivid post-Trump imagery: &quot;If I thought it would be better for Walthamstow if we built a wall around the whole of Britain I'd be the first digging. What is better for Walthamstow is a Britain that's open, confident, tolerant. But we haven't won that argument with people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Immigration will remain a toxic issue until Britain faces up to its colonial past | David Wearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Readers looking for deep intellectual analysis of these topics might be left feeling unfulfilled. &quot;I Google 'learn from history' to see if we ever learn anything from history,&quot; Dean writes at one point. &quot;I come across George Bernard Shaw 's quote, 'We learn from history that we learn nothing from history.'&quot; There is something quintessentially modern about that wry revealing of the casual nature of the writer's research. (There is an unfortunate sneer, too, when he refers to &quot;the so-called Great War (fought by so-called Great Britain)&quot;, as though the &quot;Great&quot; in either case meant &quot;ruddy marvellous&quot;.) Mind you, Dean is no uncritical info-age millennial either, referring to Twitter as &quot;that cesspool... a&nbsp;digital realm for journalists and the lonely&quot;. When he travels to Ukraine, two local teenagers tell him that, on the one hand, the internet &quot;gives me the idea that I belong to the world&quot;, but on the other it is &quot;full of fake&quot;. Which sounds about right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, then, this is an admirably humane and curious book. The upside to Dean's chatty, everyman approach - migration, he says, is &quot;a really twitchy and layered issue&quot; - is a disarmingly modest refusal to pretend that he has any answers to the awkward questions he rightly raises. In the meantime, the last word must go to the frankly amazing lines written by his great-grandfather David, not long before his death in 1984. &quot;Despite the difficulties occasioned by my fate,&quot; the war veteran and concentration-camp survivor writes to his son, &quot;I have maintained towards this highly disagreeable world a fairly positive attitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he gazes across the sea from his home in Orkney, Henry Reutzig realises he is privileged to enjoy one of the best views in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the retired paediatrician admits his idyllic life is shattered by the nightmares of his past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last two decades, Henry has spent much of his time travelling the globe to give medical aid to those fleeing disaster or conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteering with charities, he has tended to refugees as they run for their lives from warzones, including the Balkans 18 years ago and the current civil war in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has fought to save the lives of malnourished children or infants with malaria or HIV-Aids in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Henry says he is haunted by the recurring doubt that he could have done more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I do have a dream that I'm at a refugee camp somewhere and there is a queue of around a million people waiting to see me, and it's already 4pm - so we are running out of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the sadness - there is no end in sight. There are more refugees now than there have ever been in history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have a political agenda. I'm just a doctor but more needs to be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry was first inspired to volunteer in 1999 after being deeply moved by a photograph he saw in the New York Times, showing refugees fleeing the war in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the anguished faces awakened in him a memory of his own refugee past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry, 71, said: &quot;I was born a refugee. My mother and father were German and became refugees in their own country, after fleeing their home in East Prussia just ahead of the Russian Army's invasion at the end of World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With half the homes in Germany in ruins, and 14million fellow citizens displaced from the lost eastern reaches of the Reich needing shelter, Germans became the worst of unwilling hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They missed no opportunity to remind the new arrivals of their lowly status, labelling them 'habe-nichts' - have-nots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Accustomed to hearing this, I shared in the awareness of not belonging. Along with my parents, I was a sojourner, one passing through, a stranger in the town of my birth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Henry was 10, his father moved their family to start a new life in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On getting into medical school, Henry remembers he was helped by a lot of &quot;good people&quot;, including one who helped fund his college education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry, who has deep Christian faith, said: &quot;That person told me that some day I would have the opportunity to repay them by doing good work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On April 3, 1999, I bought a copy of the New York Times and that image of refugees gripped my heart. I knew the time had come for me to give back.&quot; Henry contacted the charity Medical Teams International who quickly arranged to send him to Albania - where the refugees from Kosovo were arriving in their masses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he will never forget those he met. Henry said: &quot;The atrocities that happened in that war were unbelievable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were treating people for dehydration, aches and pains, but most of all for broken hearts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember one woman who had lived in a village in central Kosovo when the militia came and rounded up all the men including her husband, brother, father, grandfather and uncle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then they murdered them all in the village square. They told the women to flee, which they did. This woman and her six children headed for Albania, and two weeks into the journey, she gave birth to her seventh child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry spent three weeks volunteering in Albania before returning to his family in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From there he was sent to Mexico, in the aftermath of overwhelming floods which aid agencies say killed more than 600 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first week, he travelled in a tiny boat offering medical help to those in the most cut-off communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following week, he headed into the mountains on foot to treat those affected by the earthquakes that struck after the flood. Henry said: &quot;The people I saw needed all sorts of medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember one girl who said her baby kept turning blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I examined the baby and knew we had to organise surgery or it wouldn't survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it hadn't been for the flood or the earthquake, then we wouldn't have been there when we were, which was exactly when the baby needed to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Against the odds, there was a happy outcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following year Henry was sent to Mozambique, to treat the sick and injured after another catastrophic flood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;There, I treated some of the sickest people I had ever seen. The malaria was very bad. I remember the first patient I saw died in front of me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last patient I saw there died in their mother's arms and for the month I was there, I saw so much heartache.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry's next trip was to Vietnam, helping to treat children with a range of genetic deformities believed to have been caused by chemicals left in the environment in the Vietnam War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;There are a lot of people with breathing difficulties, children being born with cleft palates and even a large number of deformities such as children having just one eye, in the middle of their forehead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was my job to evaluate and arrange corrective surgery, as well as training local medics in rehabilitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the 9/11 attack, Henry was sent to Afghanistan to help refugees trying to escape the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;There was a lot of dysentery - we treated some people for war-related injuries and quite a few children didn't make it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a terrible country to be in. It was so cold for one thing but a lot of people didn't want us there and on more than one occasion we had rocks thrown at us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the brutality of men there towards women and children was just heartbreaking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over a period of 17 years, Henry went on to help refugees in countries including Darfur and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;In Uganda, most of the children screamed when they first saw me.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE in Cologne have apologised for sending an email asking refugee organisations to keep asylum seekers away from the city's famous carnival this month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cologne is still on edge after the sex attacks in 2015 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several charities protecting refugees and immigrants in the west German city received a message from officers urging them not to organise excursions to the week-long festival.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some were reportedly told to keep refugees indoors while the carnival was on.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police cited the &quot;current security situation&quot; as reason to stay away, as the city remains on edge following the mass sex attacks during the 2015 New Year's Eve celebrations.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cologne Refugee Council has accused the police of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  German police claims Cologne is 'magnet for migrants'  PICTURED: Migrant gang who beat up Brit tourists in Cologne </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Rhine-Westphalia police authority has since said the message was sent without proper authorisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police spokeswoman said: &quot;The wording in this letter is ostracising. The impression is that immigrants should not attend carnival events.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claus-Ulrich Proelss of the Cologne Refugee Council said: &quot;For us the question is, what is the mental attitude behind it?&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Proelss said the council was &quot;very worried&quot; because during last New Year's Eve celebration Cologne police allegedly racially profiled groups of people with a migrant background who travelled to Cologne, taking them out of the crowd for checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Cologne carnival was actually a very good way to make refugees familiar with Germany and to forge social links with its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sent an email advising refugees to stay away from the carnival this year  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the Cologne Carnival Festival Sigrid Krebs agreed, saying: &quot;Everyone is very welcome at the Cologne carnival.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's carnival will take place from Thursday 23rd February until Ash Wednesday on February 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its climax is the so-called Rose Monday, when a giant street parade is held throughout the city, making it one of the largest street festivals in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The festival is celebrated all over the Rhineland area, as well as in the southern part of the Netherlands.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 650 North African and Arab men were screened on NYE in Cologne this year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Germany, the biggest celebrations take place in Cologne and its carnival rival Dusseldorf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the festival attracts much larger crowds and is celebrated across the whole city compared to the centralised celebrations on New Year's Eve, German authorities are on high alert for terrorist attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month Cologne police were forced to defend a controversial tweet which labelled hundreds of people being detained during New Year's Eve celebrations as &quot;Nafris&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers said the term was official police shorthand for North Africans, but several Twitter users deemed it a racial slur and accused the force of profiling.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump  slammed Malcolm Turnbull  over a proposed asylum seeker deal and accused the Australian Prime Minister of looking to ship off the 'next Boston bombers' to the United States during their first official telephone conversation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday afternoon the President took to&nbsp; Twitter  to slam the Obama  administration for agreeing to take on the refugees in the first place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!,' he wrote.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior US officials told the Washington Post &nbsp;that Donald Trump abruptly hung up on Mr Turnbull after just 25 minutes - when the pair were meant to speak for an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an indignant Mr Turnbull returned serve, telling 2GB's Ben Fordham: 'As far as the call is concerned, I'm very disappointed, the report the president hung up is not correct, the call ended courteously.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fuming President Trump reportedly told Mr Turnbull that the conversation was 'the worst call by far' he had taken that day, after 'boasting' about pleasant exchanges with Russian President Vladimir Putin and three other world leaders.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump reportedly ranted about the deal the Obama administration struck with Canberra to take 1250 genuine refugees from Nauru and Manus Island, telling Mr Turnbull: 'I don't want these people'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the 'worst deal ever', he told the prime minister, complaining he was 'going to get killed' politically for following through on the resettlement agreement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News sources claim President Trump was 'yelling' at Mr Turnbull at points during the heated conversation, which took place on Saturday afternoon Washington time, Sunday morning Australian time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT IS THE AUSTRALIA-US REFUGEE DEAL?                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration and Turnbull government struck a deal to resettle some of the refugees being held offshore in Nauru and Manus Island in November last year&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has a 'zero tolerance' policy towards illegal boat arrivals and only genuine refugees are sent to Nauru and Manus Island&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are approximately 1,250 refugees being held in the Australian-funded offshore detention centres</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large majority of those refugees come from Iran, Iraq and Somalia - all countries on US President Donald Trump's travel-ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump reportedly agreed to honour the deal, on the condition the refugees would undergo 'extreme vetting'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US President reportedly described it as the 'worst deal ever' in a heated conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump indicated he was sceptical about what America got out of honouring the deal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr Turnbull apparently suggested they move on and talk about foreign affairs, including the conflict in Syria, President Trump ended the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'During call with Australian PM on refugees, Trump pulled phone away from ear and says he wants off call, which ends abruptly per source,' CNN reporter Jim Acosta tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement reached with the Obama administration, Australian would take a number of South American refugees, currently in a processing center in Costa Rica, in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These refugees are predominantly Christian, according to reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to revelations of the hostile phone conversation, Mr Turnbull remained tight-lipped on Thursday and said that he wasn't going to comment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's better that these things - these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News reporter Laura Jayes said Australian government sources who took part in discussions after the call said Mr Turnbull viewed the president as a 'bully'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What I derived from that was Malcolm Turnbull used this phone call to push back,' Ms Jayes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He wasn't just sitting there being berated by Donald Trump, he talked about how important it was for (Trump) to honour the deal.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosive report is a huge embarrassment for Mr Turnbull, who has insisted in recent days the asylum seeker deal is solid and relations with Washington are fine.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and Australia have been close military and economic allies for generations, with Australian troops fighting alongside Americans in every military conflict Washington has been involved in since World War II.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is one of just four other countries the US shares security intelligence with under the Five Eyes alliance. The two countries have also shared a free trade agreement since 2005.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official statement about the phone call released by the White House told a different story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Both leaders emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally,' it said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull on Monday described the call as constructive, saying the pair acknowledged the already strong and deep relationship between the US and Australia and committed to making it stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That's my job. My job is to defend the national interest of Australia and defend the interests of Australians,' he told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You may wish to speculate about policies and politics in Washington, that's not my role. My job is today and everyday to stand up for Australia and that's what I do.&nbsp;'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also thanked the president for 'committing' to honour the refugee agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1.30pm (AEDT) on Thursday the US Embassy in Australia released a statement that the deal would go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'President Trump's decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed and Spokesman Spicer's comments stand,' a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this Embassy at 13:15 Canberra time.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it came after a morning of mixed messages from various official sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday it was reported that the White House had backtracked on the asylum seeker deal, saying that President Trump was still considering it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said the deal had not been confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if it were to go ahead, it would only be because of the United States' 'longstanding relationship with Australia,'&nbsp; The ABC  reported.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         'CRUEL, INHUMAN AND DEGRADING': UN HITS OUT OVER 'OPEN-AIR PRISON'                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has been heavily criticized by the UN for its policy of sending migrants to offshore detention centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November UN investigator Francois Crepeau visited the island of Nauru, where asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent, and described conditions as 'cruel, inhuman and degrading'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Crepeau said Australia's policies 'have increasingly eroded the human rights of migrants in contravention of its international human rights and humanitarian obligations'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he continued: 'Australia would vehemently protest if its citizens were treated like this by other counties and especially if Australian children were treated like this.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International said in October that the immigration center was an 'open-air prison'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes just one day after Mr Spicer told reporters Mr Trump would honour the 'one-off' deal with former President Barack Obama in November to resettle refugees detained on Manus and Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Part of the deal is they have to be vetted in the same manner that we are doing now.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Mr Trump placed a temporary ban on refugees being admitted to the US and other strict border measures targeting seven countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr Trump confirmed his administration would continue to honour the 2016 refugee resettlement arrangement while acknowledging a common interest in preventing irregular and illegal migration.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The president, in accordance with that deal to honour what had been agreed upon by the US government, and ensuring that vetting will take place in the same manner that we are doing it now, it will go forward,' Mr Spicer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are being held on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and Nauru.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters at the G'day USA gala in Hollywood, Ms Bishop said Mr Turnbull would travel to the US for a yet to be scheduled meeting with the president.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     TOUGH IMMIGRATION LAWS WHICH SEE 'BOAT PEOPLE' SENT TO OFFSHORE CAMPS                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offshore detention in Australia has been in place since 2001, and in 2013 Australia's mainland was excluded from its migration zone for people who arrive by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now migrants who arrive on Australian shores by sea are immediately sent to the island of Nauru or Papau New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stay in detention facilities while their applications to be accepted into Australia are processed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although 90 per cent are ruled to have valid claims, they are not allowed to settle in the Australian mainland, instead being allowed to stay in Nauru or Papau New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy has come under heavy fire, with conditions in the camp branded 'inhuman' by a UN inspector in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters claim it deters migrants from arriving in dangerous vessels, and ensures refugees enter the country through proper channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015 Australia agreed to accept 12,000 refugees from Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous year violence had erupted at a protest at the detention center on Manus Island, and a 23-year-old Iranian man was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull has previously stated that Australians cannot be 'misty-eyed' about immigration, saying: 'We must have secure borders and we do and we will, and they will remain so, as long as I am the prime minister of this country.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Moroccan Foreign Ministry has summoned the Algerian ambassador in Rabat to express its &quot;deep concerns&quot; over an attempt by 52 Syrian refugees to enter the country from Algeria between 17 and 19 April, website of state-owned Moroccan News Agency (MAP) reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The website's English version quoted the ministry as saying in a statement issued on 23 April, that it had &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; that the Syrian individuals had crossed the Algerian territory into Morocco through the borders of the eastern Moroccan city of Figuig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Algeria should fully shoulder its political and moral responsibility for this situation... The human tragedy that the Syrian populations are undergoing should not be used as a means of pressure or blackmail to serve the bilateral agenda&quot;, the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the website, the ministry also said that such practises were &quot;only meant to draw attention and generate a mass and uncontrollable migration inflow towards Morocco&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 22 April, website of Moroccan newspaper Assabah quoted the Ministry of Interior as saying in a statement that the Moroccan authorities were concerned over the &quot;miserable humanitarian conditions&quot; of Syrian refugees in Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities &quot;condemned the inhumane practises of Algerian authorities against those migrants&quot;, the website added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algerians respond on Twitter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news has sparked a debate on Twitter through the Arabic hashtag #Algeria_faces_Arab_treachery, which generated 5,700 tweets on 23 April. The hashtag was used to defend Algeria against accusations of mistreating Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">User @remaisa_soso said: &quot;How come you are evaluating the conditions of 50 refugees and disregarding the good conditions of thousands [of Syrians] who have been living in Algeria&quot; (http://bit.ly/2oBVyI6)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">User @sunrise984 from Syria said: &quot;To say the truth, I have been living in Algeria for three years and I have seen nothing but respect and love. Algeria is [like] our country&quot;. (http://bit.ly/2q4tLBl)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many users have criticised Syrian Al-Jazeera TV Presenter Faisal al-Kasim who said on his Facebook page: &quot;Although the Algerian regime supports President Bashar al-Assad through through its army, oil facilities and its media, the Algerian government and the people in particular have been very generous to Algerian refugees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Kasim explained that he had earlier quoted a Syrian website as saying that the Algerian authorities kicked out the 50 Syrian refugees. He apologised for reporting such news and said that they were not true. He also mentioned that the refugees were victimised by a longstanding political clash between Morocco and Algeria. (http://bit.ly/2oW2q6t)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Kasim was harshly criticised by Twitter users who said he was making false accusations against Algeria. User @Amel_Miro said: &quot;Yesterday he [Al-Kasim] claims that Algeria is deporting refugees, today he apologises instead of thanking us. What have you done for your own people Kasim?&quot;.

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A family of Syrian refugees will be moving into a specially adapted six-bedroom home after council could not find a local family to give it to.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property has been used as emergency accommodation for a year but Sevenoaks District Council and the landlord, West Kent Housing Association, had not been able to find a suitable permanent family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents had been lobbying the council to house refugees  in the home in Eynsford, Kent, since last year, but many have reacted with outrage that a refugee family will receive the property rather than a local family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some even labelled it a 'absolute disgrace' with the decision sparking a huge debate on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teresa Osborne said: 'Bloody hell, we have many families that need bigger properties in Kent, this is an absolute disgrace.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A commenter writing under the name Deano Kentish added: 'So this family of refugees just gets given a six bedroom home adapted for somebody who is disabled because there were no other candidates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I find that extremely annoying, being that my mum is disabled and has been on the list for an adapted home in West Kent for almost 19 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And that I myself applied for a home in West Kent along with my wife and four children and got refused, even though we are in a two-bed property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's overcrowded and I have to travel 35 miles daily to care for my granddad who lives in Eynsford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'When are people born and bred and who work hard in this country ever going to be considered before outsiders?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And just to clarify to every person who wants to jump at me, this is not a racial rant of any kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is a rant that families and disabled people who are born in this country - regardless of race or ethnicity - could have been homed happily in this home before any outside refugee was ever considered.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering other options, such as splitting the property or selling it, the decision was made to resettle the town's first refugee family from Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr Michelle Lowe, cabinet member for housing, said: 'We have agreed to bring our first Syrian refugee family to the district and I firmly believe this is a good outcome for everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We offered support to councils across Kent since the start of the government's Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme, but with no housing of our own, and no properties coming forward from the private rented sector, we couldn't make a commitment to house any refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We will be helping a refugee family escaping from a terrible situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At the same time the district keeps a social rented home that otherwise could have been sold and would never be available through the housing register again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have been overwhelmed with the generosity of local people contacting us to offer support.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-bedroom semi-detached home was specially adapted some time ago with wheelchair ramp access, but requires some modernisation and updating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property was used for emergency accommodation while the council and landlord tried to find a family who needed a home of that size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to local estate agents, a six-bedroom house in the area would fetch a price of at least &pound;500,000.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But fuming locals took to social media complaining that the property could have been given to another Kent family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was made at the cabinet meeting on Thursday, March 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The house was available to residents of Sevenoaks and neighbouring authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Kent considered splitting the property into two or more smaller homes, but due to the way it is laid out, it was not cost effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They considered selling the property but there was no guarantee the money would have been reinvested in the Sevenoaks District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank Czarnowski, West Kent chief executive said: 'West Kent is pleased this home will support the council to help a family fleeing the war in Syria and we hope it will give them an opportunity to settle and thrive while they remain in the UK.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sevenoaks District Council are also supporting the government's community sponsorship scheme which encourages local groups to have a greater role in supporting refugee families.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malcolm Turnbull has not denied Donald Trump told him he had his 'worst call by far' with the Australian Prime Minister as well as slamming the refugee deal in his first response to explosive claims about the two leaders' first telephone conversation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president accused Mr Turnbull of exporting the 'next Boston bombers' to the U.S. and hung up 25 minutes into the call, which was expected to be last for an hour, an unnamed source claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister refused to comment on the&nbsp; Washington Post &nbsp;report and suggestions their phone conversation over the weekend was hostile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         What is the Australia-US refugee deal?                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration and Turnbull government struck a deal to resettle some of the refugees being held offshore in Nauru and Manus Island in November last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are approximately 1,250 refugees being held offshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large majority of those refugees come from Iran, Iraq and Somalia - all countries on US President Donald Trump's travel-ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump reportedly agreed to honour the deal, on the condition the refugees would undergo 'extreme vetting'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. President reportedly described it as the 'worst deal ever' in a heated conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I'm not going to comment on these reports out of the United States about the conversation,' Mr Turnbull told a press conference from Melbourne on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Australians know me very well. I always stand up for Australia in every forum.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was better to leave the discussion out of the public domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's better that these things, these conversations, are conducted candidly, frankly, privately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You may wish to speculate about policies and politics in Washington, that's not my role. My job is today and every day to stand up for Australia and that's what I do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'My business is being the Prime Minister of Australia. That's my job. My job is to defend the national interest of Australia and to defend the interests of Australians.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull insisted the bond between the allied countries remained strong through the refugee deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I can assure you the relationship is very strong. The fact we received the assurance that we did, the fact that it was confirmed, the very extensive engagement we have with the new administration underlines the closeness of the alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But as Australians know me, very well, I stand up for Australia in every forum - public or private.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. president reportedly told the prime minister he'd spoken with four other leaders over the weekend - including Russian President Vladimir Putin - and 'this was the worst call by far'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump fumed about the deal the Obama administration struck with Canberra to take hundreds of refugees from Nauru and Manus Island, according to unnamed sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the 'worst deal ever', he told Mr Turnbull.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump complained he was going to get killed politically and accused Australia of trying to export the 'next Boston bombers'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump indicated he was sceptical about what America would get out of honouring the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A U.S. Embassy spokesperson on Thursday confirmed Tresident Trump's decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr Turnbull apparently suggested the leaders move on and talk about foreign affairs, including the conflict in Syria, Mr Trump ended the conversation, Washington Post said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call was scheduled to go for about an hour, but Mr Trump ended it after 25 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official statement about the conversation, released by the White House, told a different story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Both leaders emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally,' it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull on Monday described the call as constructive, saying the pair acknowledged the already strong and deep relationship between the US and Australia and committed to making it stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We discussed the importance of border security and the threat of illegal and irregular migration, and recognised that it is vital that every nation is able to control who comes across its borders,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Saturday phone call was their first conversation since President Trump's inauguration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender refugees from Iran have found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place after Donald Trump's executive order banning entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  US travel ban puts 20,000 refugees in 'precarious circumstances', UN says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also suspended the US refugee admissions system for 120 days, and promised to prioritise members of religious minorities. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it made no mention of people facing persecution for their sexual orientation, and several gay Iranians who have fled a country where homosexuality is punishable by death are now left stuck in Turkey, where they say they are experiencing worse homophobic abuses than in their homeland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the refugees have already had their asylum applications approved by the UN refugee agency and were due to be resettled in the US after months or even years of interviews and security checks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitra, a 27-year-old lesbian living in Denizli, a conservative city in south-west Turkey, left Iran in 2014 after receiving death threats because of her activities as the editor of Aghaliat, an online magazine focusing on LGBT issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was granted refugee status by the UN nearly two years ago, and was due to attend her final interview this month before being resettled in the US. &quot;They have just called me and said it's all cancelled,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Trump's ban came into force, the US was the only viable path to safety for gay Iranians who end up in Turkey. Canada no longer accepts them because it is focusing on Syrian refugees. European countries do not normally accept LGBT Iranians who have applied from Turkey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many of her fellow minorities, Mitra was initially approved to go to Canada. &quot;I waited for 14 months, [and] even went through the medical checks but one day they called and said Canada doesn't accept Iranians anymore and I should go to the US. Now that's up in the air too.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitra added: &quot;One by one all my dreams and hopes are being destroyed before my eyes. It doesn't matter to me whether to go to Canada or the US, I just want to go somewhere - anywhere - safe.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitra currently lives with her partner in a tiny room with one sofa that is also their bed. &quot;Iran doesn't want us, Canada doesn't want us and now the US doesn't want us either. I have seen the suicide of three friends since 2015. A gay Iranian [threw] himself off a balcony and an Iranian lesbian hanged herself just eight months ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She argued that the US should also make exemptions for sexual minorities as well. &quot;At least with religious refugees, they have the support of their families, we don't even have that. Our families are [ashamed] of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Javad, 50, is a disabled Iranian gay man also living in Turkey. &quot;I was abandoned by my family, I was abandoned by my country and now I [do not] have anywhere to go,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said two of his friends were beaten up in the street. &quot;One day a friend of mine, an Iranian gay name Pouya, called and said, 'forgive me',&quot; he said. &quot;I realised he was about to take his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am disabled, I struggled to get to his house, by the time I got there he had died. He had just had enough.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saghi Ghahraman, the head of the Canada-based Iranian Queer Organisation, said LGBT Iranians face horrific punishment and bullying. A fatwa issued in 1987 by the late Ayatollah Khomeini legalised transexuality, but social stigma remains still rampant, and homosexuality is still punishable by death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up until 2013, the wait-time for the LGBT to be determined and resettled by the [UN high commissioner for refugees] in Turkey was about a year and a half, which was barely manageable,&quot; she said. &quot;But it changed with the war in Syria, and when the USA and Canada undertook resettlement of large number of displaced Syrians, the LGBT wait-time before resettlement went up to three years,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, gay Iranian exiles have been subjected to a string of violent hate attacks and murders in Turkey, said Ghahraman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 26-year-old Azad, a gay Iranian who was approved for relocation by the UN 23 months ago, said his friend fainted in the bus when he heard about Trump's decision. &quot;We're stuck, we can't go forward, we can't go backward,&quot; he said. &quot;Turkey is so unstable too these days and anything can happen, what if they deport us back to Iran?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After less than a fortnight as President of the United StatesDonald Trumphas certainly made an impression across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trumpwas officially sworn in on January 20, 2017 and has moved quickly to enact some of the policies he talked about so boldly on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His critics hoped his more outlandish claims would be scaled back once in the White House, but so far he's banned people from a number of Muslim-majority countries from entering the US, banned Syrian refugees indefinitely, withdrawn funding from organisations that provide abortions and ordered the building of THAT wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the policiesPresident Trumphas already moved to enact:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has blocked immigrants and visa holders from seven countries - Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Sudan - from entering the US for 90 days. Announcing his &quot;extreme vetting&quot; plan, he invoked the September 11 attacks. Most of the hijackers on that day were from Saudi Arabia. The rest were from the UAE, Egypt and Lebanon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Islamic terrorists, Mr Trump was reported by the New York Times to say: &quot;We don't want them here. We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Corden says he's 'proud of the people of Liverpool' for anti-Trump protest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is confusion around the order, but it seems to apply not just to refugees or immigrants seeking entry into the US for the first time, but even to people from those seven countries who currently hold green cards and are permanent US residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if they leave the US, they may not be allowed back in. Green-card holders already in the US are reportedly being advised to postpone plans to travel abroad. Somali-born athlete Mo Farah - a four-time Olympic champion for Great Britain who now lives in the US - says he is scared he will &quot;have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restriction also applies to dual nationals. So a British citizen who is also a citizen of Iran will not be able to enter the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump tweet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Civil Liberties Union has called it a &quot;euphemism for discriminating against Muslims&quot;. A federal judge issued a temporary halt to the deportation of visa holders or refugees stranded at US airports, after the ACLU filed a lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had an immediate impact on people around the world, stranding legal residents of the US (and other countries) and travellers with visas at airports, where confusion reigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday evening, a top White House official appeared to reverse a key part of the order,the New York Times reported, saying that people from the affected countries who hold green cards will not be prevented from returning to the United States. However, he also said border agents had &quot;discretionary authority&quot; to detain and question suspicious travelers from certain countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands turn out for anti-Trump protest after travel ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Refugee Admissions Programme has been suspended for 120 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This suspends the entry of refugees into the US and directs officials to determine additional screening &quot;to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States&quot;. He also set a cap of 50,000 refugees to be accepted to the US in 2017.Barack Obamahad set the limit at 110,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raymond Offensheiser, the president of Oxfam America, said: &quot;The refugees impacted by today's decision are among the world's most vulnerable people... who are simply trying to find a safe place to live after fleeing unfathomable violence and loss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a critical humanitarian crisis in Syria, where civilians have been dying in huge numbers as a result of the country's civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost five million people have been displaced from Syria since the civil war began - in 2016, 12,587 of them ended up in the US as refugees, saidThe Guardian, who also reported that America's Syrian refugee resettlement programme has been called &quot;one of the most important in the world&quot;. According to the UN, more than 400,000 people have died in Syria's civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order stops the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another executive order signed by Trump reinstated the so-called &quot;global gag rule&quot;, to use the term adopted by its critics.According to Vox, &quot;this is a a policy from previous Republican administrations that blocks federal funding from international family planning organisations that 'either provide abortion or discuss abortion services with their clients'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House press secretary Sean Spicer said this would &quot;end the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas, along with coercive abortion and sterilization practices&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Vox reports that there's already a law in place to prevent foreign aid from being used to provide abortions. The &quot;global gag rule&quot; goes further by also taking funding from international organisations that discuss abortion services (which could then be privately funded).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter backlash as Trump signs anti-abortion law in one of first acts as President</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump is not the first to do this, though. The policy was introduced in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan. Since then, every Democratic president has rescinded the measure and every Republican has brought it back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen said: &quot;We know that when family planning services and contraceptives are easily accessible, there are fewer unplanned pregnancies, maternal deaths, and abortions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This executive order called on the Department of Homeland Security to &quot;take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border&quot;. A second order pledges to hire 10,000 more immigration officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he was going to build the wall, which he described as &quot;beautiful&quot;, and insisted it would be paid for by the Mexican government, who have repeatedly said they won't be doing that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump wall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US-Mexico border is 1,989 miles long and there are already fences built along parts of it. However, the US doesn't own all of the land adjacent to the border, law professor Philip Schragtold CBS. He said: &quot;In Texas, apparently there are a great many of the lands adjacent to the border in private hands, so the government would first have to seize the land by eminent domain or purchase it from the owners and then deal with the construction problems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five ways Trump's decisions will affect you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Keystone pipeline is a 1,179-mile pipeline being built, running from Canada to America's Gulf Coast. It would carry petroleum. Its construction was halted by Barack Obama in 2015, with concerns over how its continued construction squared with a commitment to climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dakota Access pipeline would carry crude oil from the state of North Dakota to other parts of the country. There have been massive protests over its construction after the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said the pipeline interfered with their drinking water. And in December, the Army Corps of Engineers said it would explore an alternative route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump signed memoranda that renew the process for constructing both pipelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump Liverpool</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trans-Pacific Partnership (or TPP) negotiations began under President Obama. Trump has issued a memorandum that called on the US to pull out of the partnership. The deal had never actually gone into effect in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) was a huge overhaul of the US healthcare system done by the previous president's administration. Its aim was to extend health insurance coverage to those in the US that didn't have it (an estimated 15%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It did this by requiring all Americans to have health insurance but offering subsidies to make coverage more affordable. It also required businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to offer health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have constantly opposed it, however, saying it imposes too many costs on business and intrudes too far into the lives and affairs of private businesses and individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten anti-trump placards that prove no one can protest quite like Scousers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first things Trump did as president was to issue a directive to federal agencies involved in the healthcare system to &quot;waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay&quot; any portion of the Affordable Care Act that creates financial burden on states, individuals or healthcare providers. He said this should be done &quot;to the maximum extent permitted by law&quot;. This order technically does not give these agencies any powers they don't already have - it's been described more as &quot;a planted flag&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump signed an order that he said would result in &quot;a great rebuilding of the armed services of the United States&quot;. He called for budget negotiations to acquire new planes, ships and resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump said America's &quot;military strength will be questioned by no one, but neither will the nation's commitment to peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump issued a memorandum imposing a freeze on all federal civilian employees &quot;across the board&quot;. No vacant positions were allowed to be filled and no new positions could be created &quot;except in limited circumstances&quot;. The memorandum does not apply to military personnel. Trump wants to reduce government debts and decrease the size of the federal workforce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRITICS have laid into &quot;ridiculous&quot; protestors campaigning over Donald Trump's migrant ban by highlighting President Barack Obama was actually the first to boot refugees out of America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outrage has erupted over the US President's controversial temporary executive order to halt refugees from seven Muslim countries, with thousands of protestors taking to the street across the world.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However opponents have been quick to highlight Barack Obama banned Iraqi refugees from entering the US in 2011 over terrorism fears.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama's administration stopped processing all applications from Iraqi migrants over a six-month time period.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also emerged Democrat favourite and husband of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, took a tough stance against immigration, deporting the highest number on record in 2000 when 1,864,343 aliens were booted out, according to the US Center for Immigration studies.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protestors take to the streets to campaign against Donald Trump's migrant ban </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iain Dale, political commentator and LBC presenter, waded into the debate telling protestors not to get carried away.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote: &quot;I condemn it unreservedly and I think the Prime Minister made a mistake in not doing the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, let's put this into a little perspective before we all rush away with the idea that Trump has done something totally wicked, unprecedented and proves that he is a modern day incarnation of Hitler...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Back in 2011 President Obama did exactly the same thing. He banned all refugees from Iraq. Not for three months, but for six.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was not a peep from the media about this. Or if there was, I must have missed it. But that's because of course Obama could do no wrong.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump has banned refugees from seven Muslim countries from entering the US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;It is based on prejudice and fearmongering. It's not a Fascist measure - unless you're happy to apply the word to Barack Obama too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Dale's comments come after George Galloway came to defence of&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;and lashed out at Clinton and Obama supporters for standing by when Democrats murdered a &quot;million Muslims&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Labour MP tweeted: &quot;Obama deported more folks than ALL US presidents put together. If you were with Obama you've no moral standing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump's executive order has banned migrants from seven Muslim countries including Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran, and Iraq from coming to the US for the next 90 days.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive order also indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from entering and lowers migrant numbers entering the US to 50,000 refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the order has been introduced, 109 people who were in transit on airplanes were denied entry and 173 had not been allowed to get on their planes overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump raised Obama's Iraqi ban to justify his migrant ban </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so far no green-card holders have been prevented from entering the US.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump raised Obama's Iraqi ban on January 29 when he attempted to defend his immigration executive order.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote: &quot;My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The seven countries named in the executive order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Obama's freeze over the processing of Iraqi refugees for six months was introduced after two Al-Qaeda members from Iraq, who were living in Bowling Green, Kentucky, admitted to targeting US troops in Iraq.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However his programme did not impact green card holders, or anyone with a visa.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also didn't affect refugees who had already gone through the vetting process.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in contrast, Mr Trump's order gives preference to religious minority groups, such as Christians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he was born in one of the countries President Trump has targeted, travelling on a British passport will not help him return home.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement means Iraqis seeking to enter the U.S. on a British passport, for instance, will be barred, according to a U.S. official. British citizens don't normally require a visa to enter the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Travelers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa,' the statement said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or non-immigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period. Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Conservative MP also tweeted to say he is banned from the USA under President Trump's controversial ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadhim Zahawi represents Stratford-on-Avon but both he and his wife were born in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tweeted: 'I'm a British citizen &amp; so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear ill [sic] be banned from the USA based on my country of birth.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: 'Had confirmation that the order does apply to myself and my wife as we were both born in Iraq. Even if we are not dual Nat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A sad sad day to feel like a second class citizen! Sad day for the USA.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban has also already affected an Iranian director nominated for an Oscar, who now won't be able to attend the Hollywood award ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated in the best foreign film category for his movie The Salesman but there are fears he may now not be able to attend next month's Academy Awards, because he was born in Iran.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian-born actress who stars in Farhadi's The Salesman vowed to boycott the Oscars over Trump's immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taraneh Alidoosti, the 33-year-old known as the Natalie Portman of Iran, took to Twitter with a message for fans on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest,' she tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ANTI-IMMIGRATION ORDER DO?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban refugee entries from all countries for 120 days. Refugees can be accepted on case-by-case basis, including&nbsp;if they are a religious minority facing religious persecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Block refugee entries from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap refugee intake at 50,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban visa and immigration entries for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries on banned list, including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspend visa issuance to countries of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven refugees bound for the U.S. were stopped from boarding a plane in Cairo on Saturday and 12 migrants were detained in New York overnight because they arrived just after the executive order was signed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqi refugees who was detained for 14 hours at New York, was released on Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 53-year-old had arrived in America on a flight from Istanbul on Friday night, just hours after Trump implemented the immigration ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had worked for the U.S. government in Iraq for 10 years as a translator, engineer and contractor and had a valid special immigration visa to relocate to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dual-citizenship ban doesn't apply to U.S. citizens who are also citizens of the seven nations singled out by Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department statement also said such restrictions don't apply to people from those countries traveling on diplomatic visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. consulate in Erbil have stopped accepting visa applications from Iraqi nationals until further notice, except for certain diplomatic exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The urgent steps come as State Department officials try to sort out how to implement Mr. Trump's broadly-worded policy executive order. Officials said they received little information about the ban before it took effect from the Trump team.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One described how a draft of the order was brought in unofficially to the State Department earlier this week to review before it took effect.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, Theresa May repeatedly refused to criticise President Trump's executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At&nbsp;a news conference in Ankara, Prime Minister May said: 'The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.&nbsp;The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom's policy on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And our policy on refugees is to have a number of voluntary schemes to bring Syrian refugees into the country, particularly those who are most vulnerable but also to provide significant financial contributions to support refugees in countries surrounding Syria.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However just yards away from her, Prime Minister Yildirim was putting the boot in, saying building walls would not help the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: 'We cannot solve this refugee problem by putting up walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We opened our doors, and if they come again, we would take them again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Regional problems cannot be solved by sweeping them under the carpet.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: 'British citizens banned from the US and our government has nothing to say? Disgrace.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order&nbsp;declares that U.S. policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also&nbsp;gives Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year, according to the order.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian director nominated for an Oscar won't be able to attend the Hollywood award ceremony after Donald Trump signed off on his tough new immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated in the best foreign&nbsp;film category for his film The Salesman but there are fears he may now not be able to attend next month's Academy Awards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His native Iran, which is where The Salesman was filmed, is one of seven countries listed in Trump's executive order that has placed a 90-day pause on visas and immigration to the U.S.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, tweeted on Saturday morning that&nbsp;Farhadi would be banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Iran's Asghar Farhadi won't be let into the US to attend Oscar's. He's nominated for best foreign language film... #MuslimBan,' he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as visa, green card holders and refugees were blocked from entering the United States just hours after Trump signed the order on Friday afternoon. &nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were stopped from boarding a flight from Cairo on Saturday, while at least two Iraqis were detained after flying in to New York's JFK airport on Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panic broke out after Department of Homeland Security issued a directive at 4.30pm on Friday enforcing Trump's executive order to essentially close down the borders to refugees and visa holders from a list of banned Muslim-majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Iran, the other countries on Trump's blacklist are Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian-born actress who stars in Farhadi's The Salesman vowed to boycott the Oscars over Trump's immigration bans.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest,' she tweeted.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visa ban has sparked legal limbo for some refugees already who were on their way to the U.S. when the order came into effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Iraqi refugees, including one who had worked for the U.S. government in Iraq for 10 years, were detained at New York's JFK airport on Friday, The New York Times &nbsp;reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men were on separate flights when immigration officials stopped them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who had worked as a interpreter with the U.S. Army in Iraq, was travelling with his wife and three children at the time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other man, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was flying to American to join his wife and son in Texas.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers representing the two Iraqi men were desperately seeking to have their clients released in court on Saturday morning.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's JFK airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane on Saturday after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action at Cairo airport was the first there since Trump imposed the three-month ban on refugees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear how many refugees or visa holders are already being detained across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee said there was chaos at airports and in the air following Trump's ban with the organization already receiving calls for help from green card and other visa holders after being boarding and admission into the United States at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Visas being denied immediately. Chaos at airports and in the air. #MuslimBan will apply to green card holders attempting to return tonight,' the ADC's Abed Ayoub tweeted on Friday night.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's ban puts a 90-day pause on visas and immigration from seven countries including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also puts a 120-day ban on all refugee entries into the country and declares that refugees from Syria are not welcome until further notice.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that,' Zuckerberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows reports that Muslim-majority countries with ties to Trump's business empire have excluded from the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics show Trump doesn't have any business relations with the seven black-listed countries, but does with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey, the NY Daily News reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order&nbsp;declares that U.S. policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year, according to the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order declares that the U.S. will 'prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution.'&nbsp;But that only applies when 'the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Rescue Committee called President Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a 'harmful and hasty' decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said: 'America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust - involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by '12 to 15 government agencies.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miliband praised U.S.'s record as a resettlement destination and said: 'This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated in the best foreign&nbsp;film category for his movie The Salesman but there are fears he may now not be able to attend next month's Academy Awards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His native Iran, which is where The Salesman was filmed, is one of seven countries listed in Trump's executive order that has placed a 90-day pause on visas and immigration to the U.S.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, tweeted on Saturday morning that&nbsp;Farhadi would be banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Iran's Asghar Farhadi won't be let into the US to attend Oscar's. He's nominated for best foreign language film... #MuslimBan,' he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as visa, green card holders and refugees were blocked from entering the United States just hours after Trump signed the order on Friday afternoon. &nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were stopped from boarding a flight from Cairo on Saturday, while at least two Iraqis were detained after flying in to New York's JFK airport on Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panic broke out after Department of Homeland Security issued a directive at 4.30pm on Friday enforcing Trump's executive order to essentially close down the borders to refugees and visa holders from a list of banned Muslim-majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Iran, the other countries on Trump's blacklist are Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian-born actress who stars in Farhadi's The Salesman vowed to boycott the Oscars over Trump's immigration bans.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taraneh Alidoosti, the 33-year-old known as the Natalie Portman of Iran,&nbsp;took to Twitter&nbsp;with a message for fans on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest,' she tweeted.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visa ban has sparked legal limbo for some refugees already who were on their way to the U.S. when the order came into effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Iraqi refugees, including one who had worked for the U.S. government in Iraq for 10 years, were detained at New York's JFK airport on Friday, The New York Times &nbsp;reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men were on separate flights when immigration officials stopped them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That covers legal permanent residents - green card holders - and visa-holders from those seven countries who were out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban.&nbsp;They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane on Saturday after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action at Cairo airport was the first there since Trump imposed the three-month ban on refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutch airline KLM says it had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world - that these people are no longer welcome,' Manel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the seven, who were from the seven blacklisted countries, were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear how many refugees or visa holders are already being detained across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee said there was chaos at airports and in the air following Trump's ban with the organization already receiving calls for help from green card and other visa holders after being refused admission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Visas being denied immediately. Chaos at airports and in the air. #MuslimBan will apply to green card holders attempting to return tonight,' the ADC's Abed Ayoub tweeted on Friday night.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's ban puts a 90-day pause on visas and immigration from seven countries including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ANTI-IMMIGRATION ORDER DO?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban refugee entries from all countries for 120 days. Refugees can be accepted on case-by-case basis, including&nbsp;if they are a religious minority facing religious persecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Block refugee entries from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap refugee intake at 50,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban visa and immigration entries for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries on banned list, including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspend visa issuance to countries of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also puts a 120-day ban on all refugee entries into the country and declares that refugees from Syria are not welcome until further notice.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that period of time, refugees will be accepted only from countries that the State and Homeland Security Departments decide are safe to work with.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also provides a list of possible mechanisms for 'vetting' prospective immigrants and catching those 'seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google urged its staff travelling overseas on Friday to immediately return to the U.S. if they would be affected by the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEO Sundar Pichai issued a memo slamming Trump's order saying 100 employees were affected, Bloomberg  reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech company feared its employees, even though they have valid visas, would be stopped from returning to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg hit out at Trump condemning his anti-immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that,' Zuckerberg said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows reports that Muslim-majority countries with ties to Trump's business empire have been excluded from the order, Bloomberg  reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics show Trump doesn't have any business relations with the seven black-listed countries, but does with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order&nbsp;declares that U.S. policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also&nbsp;gives Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year, according to the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order declares that the U.S. will 'prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution.'&nbsp;But that only applies when 'the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Rescue Committee called President Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a 'harmful and hasty' decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said: 'America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust - involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by '12 to 15 government agencies.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miliband praised U.S.'s record as a resettlement destination and said: 'This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only two Syrian refugee families have been resettled under the government's community refugee sponsorship scheme, six months after it was unveiled by the home secretary and the archbishop of Canterbury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the charities backing the scheme, which is designed to help individuals and community groups offer housing and other support to refugees, said the delay &quot;risked squandering the resources of hundreds of volunteers happy to help save the government time and money&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Open Society Foundations, backed by financier George Soros, said they had &quot;dozens of community groups ready and willing to take the burden for resettling refugees off the government's shoulders but their applications have been stuck in a queue for six months&quot;. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation noted that Canada had resettled more than 13,000 Syrian refugees through a similar private sponsorship programme since November 2015. &quot;The lives of people who have fled bombs and gunfire should not become a political football ... The government must finally get this good idea off the ground,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community refugee sponsorship scheme was meant to supplement the work of the Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme, under which the government pledged to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020. So far 4,400 have been accepted under this programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Launching the community scheme last July, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said: &quot;I hope that this new approach will help bring communities together and support these often traumatised and vulnerable families as they rebuild their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government launched a website at the same time for people who wanted to register offers of support - everything from offers of work, mentoring and baby equipment to housing. Sponsors were due to provide housing for the refugee families and to offer them help with integration into life in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archbishop of Canterbury welcomed a family to live in a cottage in the grounds of Lambeth Palace. Only one other family has been welcomed under the scheme since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson: &quot;Our intention has always been that this relatively new scheme would start on a small scale and be monitored closely to ensure it delivers positive outcomes for resettled families and local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Russia bans two Soros foundations from disbursing grants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have seen considerable interest in the scheme from across the UK and are working with a number of groups as they develop their plans. Supporting a vulnerable resettled family is a significant responsibility and it is only right that we carefully assess every sponsoring organisation.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of the UK Syrian resettlement programme, Paul Morrison, said in a Commons committee hearing last year that the government was &quot;deliberately starting relatively small-scale, because this is a new and novel approach in this country&quot;. Officials were creating a system for checking whether potential sponsors had &quot;credible plan&quot; for supporting a resettled family, backed by &quot;relevant experience&quot;, and would not pose any risk to the resettled family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Accounts Committee report noted that &quot;community sponsorship is new to the UK&quot;, unlike Canada, which has been running a similar initiative for the past 40 years and has made wide use of private sponsorship and community sponsorship as part of its resettlement programmes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Simmonds, chair of the Local Government Association's asylum, refugee and migration taskforce, said it was a cause for concern if &quot;volunteers, who could take some burden off the taxpayer, are not having their offers of help taken up. Why have taxpayers' money used if there are people ready to volunteer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregory Maniatis, senior migration policy advisor with the Open Society Foundations, was meeting Home Office officials to discuss the policy on Wednesday. He said he believed the UK government was doing pioneering work in this area. &quot;It is very difficult to launch a programme like this. It takes a lot of infrastructure and you don't want to get it wrong. It is hard to build a grassroots movement to support refugees, but it can potentially be a game-changer. Public attitudes can shift in positive ways.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of people who fled to Canada  to escape President Donald Trump 's crackdown on illegal migrants  have become trapped in legal limbo because of an overburdened refugee system, struggling to find work, permanent housing or enrol their children in schools.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee claims are taking longer to be completed than at any time in the past five years, according to previously unpublished Immigration and Refugee Board data provided to Reuters.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those wait times are set to grow longer after the IRB in April allocated 'up to half' of its 127 tribunal members to focus on old cases.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of delayed hearings more than doubled from 2015 to 2016 and is on track to increase again this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearings are crucial to establishing a claimant&acute;s legal status in Canada. Without that status, they struggle to convince employers to hire them or landlords to rent to them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claimants cannot access loans or student financial aid, or update academic or professional credentials to meet Canadian standards.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada's refugee system was struggling to process thousands of applications even before 3,500 asylum seekers began crossing the U.S. border on foot in January.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It lacks the manpower to complete security screenings for claimants and hear cases in a timely manner.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often there are not enough tribunal members to decide cases or interpreters to attend hearings, the IRB said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 4,500 hearings scheduled in the first four months of 2017 were cancelled, according to the IRB data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is now focused on clearing a backlog of about 24,000 claimants, including people who filed claims in 2012 or earlier.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means more than 15,000 people who have filed claims so far this year, including the new arrivals from the United States, will have to wait even longer for their cases to be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum cases are already taking longer to finalize, on average, than at any time since Canada introduced a statutory two-month time limit in 2012. This year, it has been taking 5.6 months on average, compared to 3.6 months in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed Daud, 36, left his family and a pending refugee claim in the United States and walked into Canada in February after hearing rumors of U.S. immigration raids.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daud, originally from Somalia, had been living and working legally in Nebraska but feared he would be detained and then deported at an upcoming check-in with immigration officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His May 8 hearing with a Canadian refugee tribunal was cancelled three days beforehand. He has not been given a new date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I don&acute;t know when they will call me. I can&acute;t work. It isn't easy,' said Daud. While waiting for a work permit, he gets approximately C$600 ($453) a month in government social assistance and shares a room in an apartment with six other asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Daud doesn't regret abandoning his life in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The worry, the fear is the same,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To try to speed cases through, Canada's refugee tribunal has put people from certain war-torn countries such as Syria and Yemen on an expedited track that requires no hearings.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Border agents are working overtime to address the backlog in security screenings, said Scott Bardsley, spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who oversees the Canada Border Services Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum claimants are eligible for work permits while awaiting hearings, but employers are often reluctant to employ people with temporary social insurance numbers whose future is uncertain, refugee lawyers told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'How do you establish yourself when your status is unknown?' said Toronto-based lawyer Aadil Mangalji.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year is on track to be the highest year for refugee claims since at least 2011, according to government statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stresses on the Canadian system mirror those of other countries with an open door policy. In Sweden, rising financial strains involved in resettlement were partly behind a move to introduce tough asylum laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honduran Raul Contreras, 19, who walked across the Quebec border in March and whose hearing has been postponed indefinitely, is staying in a government-subsidized Toronto hotel with his mother, step-father and uncle.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contreras, who spends his days at a local library or working out in the hotel gym, says he has been repeatedly rejected by landlords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They just said that they didn't rent places to refugee claimants,' he said. '(They) said that refugees don't have jobs and probably wouldn't pay.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMENT; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">802 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 16-year-old Gambian boy was found last week clinging to the fuel tank of a rubber dinghy that had sunk in the Mediterranean. He told rescuers he was the sole survivor out of 150 passengers, including children and pregnant women. His story is the stuff of nightmares, but the other deaths are already a statistic. Roughly 8,500 people have drowned in the Med in the past two years, with a frequency that has become part of the warp and weft of migrant life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it is more numbers you are after, our former man in Libya has a staggering one of his own. Joseph Walker-Cousins, who headed the British embassy office in Benghazi, told a House of Lords committee last week that 1m migrants were &quot;in the pipeline&quot;, hoping to cross from Libya to Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summer is coming, and the gruesome people traffickers who rake in billions from their immoral trade will soon be busier than ever. There is a way to put them out of business, but first we have to toughen up and stop crying crocodile tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pullquoteWe may one day go shopping for refugee-made goods in the way we now buy Fairtrade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more we destroy the smugglers' boats, the flimsier the craft in which migrants set sail. So that's no answer. Nobody minds about the drownings as much as they should, because European navies and charity vessels pick up the majority of stricken passengers. Hell, we might as well cut out the middlemen and ferry people here ourselves from north African ports. It would be more efficient and save more lives. We won't, of course, because entire nations would then join the exodus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a mad, mad system. Walker-Cousins is rightly incensed by the cynicism of the trade in humans. He argued persuasively that we should have been patrolling Libya's land borders to deter migrants from across Africa rather than trying to stop them &quot;a stone's throw&quot; from their final destination. But it's too late for all that. No one wants to own the problem, he said. &quot;It is somebody else's mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians would rather look the other way, even though it's as plain as can be that voters regard controlling immigration as a priority. The worst of it is that western Europe is taking in relatively few migrants, even if it doesn't feel that way. Despite Angela Merkel's disastrously misplaced generosity in Germany, up to 90% of the world's refugees are stuck in camps and settlements near their countries of origin - Syrians in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon; Afghans in Pakistan and Iran; Somalis in Ethiopia and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee policy designed to cope with the vast resettlement of displaced people after the Second World War has mutated into the provision of semi-permanent UN and charity-backed tent cities near conflict zones, which only the most affluent and well-connected migrants manage to escape or avoid. The huddled masses on rickety boats are the ones who have the means to pay the people smugglers, not the wretched of the earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruelly, every encouragement we give to migrants to &quot;integrate&quot; with their host countries in the West deprives their own shattered nations of the doctors, engineers, teachers and business people needed to rebuild. And we are deluded enough to think we are being kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These observations are brilliantly made in a new book, Refuge, by two centre-left Oxford academics, Alexander Betts and Paul Collier (the latter's book Exodus was equally thought-provoking about mass migration). They point out that the Pope himself - after offering to take in Syrian refugees - gave a home at the Vatican to a teacher and engineer. Perhaps they'll return, eventually. Most won't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of making the usual hand-wringing humanitarian gestures, Betts and Collier have come up with some mind-blowingly simple, practical solutions, particularly for refugees from fragile or war-torn states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main problem with refugee camps, they argue, is the ban on work. The host country understandably fears depriving its own citizens of jobs and worries that the refugees will never go home. As a result, the most able migrants risk their lives to leave while the rest are warehoused for years, dependent on aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why not invest in special enterprise zones with factories and workplaces staffed by a combination of local workers and migrants? These businesses would, ideally, be &quot;footloose&quot; - that is, able to return with refugees to their homes to help in the economic rebuilding of their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a wonderful idea, and all the better for working with the grain of existing small-scale experiments in Jordan and elsewhere. If it takes off, we may one day go shopping for refugee-made goods in the way we now buy Fairtrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West should always be a haven for individuals fleeing persecution, but not a mass transit destination. This way, we can cut off the people smugglers' trade without leaving migrants to their fate.@sarahbaxterSTM</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May has insisted she was not given prior warning by US President Donald Trump of his ban on refugees, but said everyone knew he planned to impose travel restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at Prime Minister's Question Time as to why Downing Street had failed to deny she had advance notice of some of the aspects of the ban on Muslims and refugees, Mrs May said President Trump had campaigned on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he is asking me whether I had advance notice of the ban on refugees, the answer is no. If he is asking me if I had advance notice that the executive order could affect British citizens, the answer is no.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he is asking if I had advance notice of the travel restrictions, the answer is we all did, because President Trump said he was going to do this in his election campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May appeared to criticise the mass demonstrations that took place in the wake of the ban, as she defended the Government's record in ensuring that British citizens would not be impacted by the restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said: &quot;The question is how you respond. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The job of Government is not to chase the headlines, the job of Government is not to take to the streets in protest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The job of Government is to protect the interests of British citizens and that is exactly what we did.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister told the Commons that Mr Trump's action was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the policy that President Trump has introduced, this Government is clear that that policy is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; We wouldn't do it, in six years as home secretary I never introduced such a policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We believe it is divisive and wrong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister told MPs her talks with the US president in the White House had achieved &quot;significant&quot; results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I visited the United States, I am pleased to say that I was able to build on the relationship we have with our most important ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And to get some very significant commitments form President Trump. And crucial among those was a 100% commitment to Nato. Nato, which keeps us safe, and keeps Europe safe too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When questioned by Mr Corbyn over why she had failed to condemn the ban when asked about it three times on the day after it was imposed, the Prime Minister said: &quot;I have made very clear, very clear that we believe that this policy is divisive and wrong, that it is not a policy that we would introduce, and I have also made very clear when asked about this, that this Government has a very different approach to these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On refugees, this Government has a proud record of support that we have given to refugees, and long may it continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labour leader said: &quot;The Prime Minister said the United States is responsible for the United States policy on refugees, but, surely, it is the responsibility of all of us to defend the 1951 Refugee Convention which commits this country, the United States, and 142 other states, to accept refugees without regard to their race, religion, or country of origin? President Trump has breached that convention; why didn't she speak out?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May told MPs: &quot;It is absolutely the case that this country welcomes refugees to the United Kingdom and we do so regardless of their religion. There is no question of discriminating on religion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Corbyn said: &quot;At last week's Prime Minister's Question Time, the Prime Minister told the House 'I'm not afraid to speak frankly to the President of the United States'. What happened?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Islamist Terrorist Threat Growing <BR> Jordan has long been a target of Islamist terrorist groups given its close alliance with the US and strong pro-Western stance, but the rise of IS, the Syrian civil war and resultant refugee influx from across the border have significantly raised the risk of attacks taking place within the country. This was illustrated by the December 18 strike in Karak, resulting in at least 10 deaths caused by alleged IS-linked militants - only the latest in a series of attacks, foiled plots and related arrests taking place in Jordan over 2016.These recent incidents suggest that IS has established a small support base in the country, despite the fact that the vast majority of Jordanians reject Islamist extremism. This argument is strengthened by the results of the International Republican Institute (IRI)'s June 2016 poll, which indicate that 25% of Jordanians believe the ideology of IS has support among the local population ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">see chart below</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).Coupled with limited meaningful democratic reform, a lack of economic opportunities and high youth unemployment (perceived by many Jordanians to have risen further as a result of the Syrian refugee influx) facilitate recruitment to Islamist militant groups among the local population - more than 90% of which is Sunni. Over 2,000 Jordanians have joined IS in Iraq and Syria, many of which are expected to return home as the group loses territory on the ground. Some are likely to establish local cells upon their return, or attempt to carry out attacks in-country.<BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such, we expect the Islamist terrorist threat to remain elevated in Jordan over the next several years. Any large-scale attacks within the country would negatively affect the tourism sector - a key revenue source for Jordan, accounting for over 5% of its GDP in 2015 - and likely deter some foreign investors. We note, however, that the Jordanian security forces are among the most capable regionally, enjoying strong support from the US and other allies, and attacks are only likely to be sporadic. Refugee Influx To Present Social Challenges <BR> Large amounts of aid from the international community (totalling USD1.5bn in the January-October 2016 period alone) have enabled Jordanian authorities to absorb the economic costs of the Syrian refugee influx reasonably well in past quarters. We expect this to remain the case over the next few years, given the billions of dollars of funding pledged by international allies over 2016.However, the large number of Syrian refugees now living in the country - counting over 655,000 in June 2016, according to the UNHCR (excluding those who have not registered) - also presents substantial social challenges. In particular, many Jordanians blame Syrian refugees for exacerbating the lack of jobs available domestically.<BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the June poll by the IRI, over 65% of Jordanians surveyed believed that attitudes toward Syrian refugees were getting 'worse' (8% thought they were getting 'better' while 26% believed they 'remained the same'). The refugee population in Jordan is likely to remain sizable throughout our forecast period, as the Syrian civil war is still ongoing, and experts estimate the reconstruction process to take up to a decade. With economic conditions set to remain challenging and, consequently, competition for resources and opportunities intensifying, tensions between the local population and refugees are likely to increase.This would also lead to more widespread discontent with Amman, potentially resulting in popular protests. However, we note that such protests would likely be directed at the government, rather than the royal family, the former of which the king has the power to dismiss. Domestic support for King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein - widely regarded as a guarantor of peace and security in a largely unstable region - remains strong, and the chances of his rule being challenged over the coming years appear minimal. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashamed by the government's response to the refugee crisis in her native country Hungary and desperate to help the situation in some small way, Berlin-based writer and semi-professional cook Anna Gyulai Gaal looked to food as a starting point. To build bridges between locals and newcomers in the German capital, she decided to invite refugees to host dinners in her home. &quot;I know how it feels to be a newcomer somewhere, not knowing the language, not having a grasp of the culture,&quot; the 30-year-old who also runs a Hungarian kitchen told The Independent. Estimates suggest that since the war began in 2011, at least 200,000 Syrians have entered Germany.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While reporting on refugee camps, Gyulai Gaal learned that most forms of emergency accommodation in Germany do not have kitchens. She found this heartbreaking. &quot;Food is such an easy and great way to connect, why not to open up our home?&quot; she thought. Twice a month, Syrian refugees cook for and dine with guests who pay Euro 38 (&pound;33) per head. After Gyulai Gaal has paid for ingredients and taxes, the rest of the money goes to the chefs. The exchange enables the cooks, all of whom have been women so far, to indulge in a taste of home while Berliners learn about their city's new residents and encounter new flavours. Since the first dinner a year ago, about seven women have formed the core group of cooks. &quot;Some of the dishes they cook were entirely new to me. The stuffed mini-courgettes and aubergines, called Mehshi, or the Kebbah, the deep fried bulgur balls, filled with minced lamb and walnuts came as a surprise with their rich flavours. Or my personal favourite, the south Syrian chicken-onion pie, the Rgaga.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gyulai Gaal admits that, at first, there were some awkward moments between the cooks and the guests, but that she has worked to iron these out. Over time, relationships have flourished. &quot;Some of them spoke good English when we met, some nothing but Arabic. As their German is developing, totally new aspects of their personalities are opening up. It's amazing. Eventually we learn that we not all that different. We've had many special moments in the past 12 months. Sometimes it can be emotional, sometimes rather cheerful, it depends on the guests too and on the chemistry between all of us. One those moments was the visit of a Greek lady and her daughter who actually helped the arriving boats to shore in Greece a couple of months earlier. It was a very touching moment. The daughter, living in Berlin, has come to most of the dinners ever since. She is a new friend to all of us. If the women feel comfortable enough, we will talk about the terrifying events of their lives. What they had to leave behind, how worried are they for their loved ones that are still in Syria, how uncertain their life was a year ago. They often show photos of their family members. Some are dead, some are still alive in the middle of the war, and about some they have no information. They just have hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gyulai Gaal is careful to ensure that hardship isn't the only topic of conversation, to save the dinners from becoming crisis porn. &quot;I am always trying to lead conversations into directions other than just &quot;How did you get to Europe? Was it scary?' because these women have so much to offer and their journey is just a little part of it. I'm trying to avoid the 'disaster tourism' at our dinners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, Gyulai Gaal doesn't underplay the significance of her small effort in the face of an overwhelming crisis. &quot;These dinners are more than just a meal for everyone involved. I think both parties have an image of each other and these dinners help to understand that these images are often false. I do believe that by offering my home and my time and a little bit of money two Saturdays a month, I make life a tiny bit better, a tiny bit more cheerful and purposeful. Not only for the lives of the cooks but my own and often some of the guests, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bibi and Sara* have only known each other for two weeks, but they cling to each other like limpets: broken but bonded, sitting on the edge of communal land in Calais that, for now, they must call home. They are difficult to spot initially in the woods and industrial estates near the former site of the Jungle, the point at which thousands of refugees from around the world have congregated to try to enter the UK by whatever means possible. In a sea of young men playing football and Connect 4, they have learnt to make themselves invisible. It is their superpower, if you will. It is their only power: the unseen girls of the refugee crisis, learning to survive by playing dead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their faces are blank, their eyes empty, their expressions those of battered dolls. Fifteen months ago, when Sara was 15, her mother sold their house in war-torn Eritrea so Sara could be smuggled out to a place of safety. It is unlikely that she pictured this for her daughter: a dirty sleeping bag in a tent in some woods, shared with 20 other refugees, most of them men who claim to be protecting the 17-year-old girl. Bibi is the only other female sleeping here for four months, she was the only woman here at all. I ask the 23-year-old from Ethiopia what that was like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">`Look at my face,' she says. It is the face of someone defeated. `I came here for a better life, but it is almost similar.' Bibi says she recently spent three days in hospital after a beating by the French police. `When they do it here,' she says, placing her hands on both of her cheeks, `there is no problem. But when they do it here' she pats her abdomen `it is not good.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sara admitted to a member of the refugee child protection team that she had been imprisoned and repeatedly raped while seeking passage through Libya, only escaping when she became so weak that her captors flung her out on to the street, like a discarded food wrapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I arrive in Calais with the charity Help Refugees, it is suggested that I might want to talk to Sara for my story if we can find her. The Jungle may have been squalid and at times dangerous but, as one volunteer puts it, `there was at least a sense of community. We could keep an eye on the children. We knew where they were and we knew if they had gone missing.' Since the encampment was demolished last October, it has been almost impossible to keep track of the children and young adults who reside here in a sort of purgatory, refusing to lay down roots in a country they view as hostile due to the often heavy-handed actions of the riot police, but unwilling to return to their countries of birth for fear of even more punishing regimes or letting their families down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees estimates that a third of the unaccompanied minors in the Jungle are unaccounted for since the eviction from the site. `Kids can be much more susceptible to making dangerous decisions proposed by people who prey on their youth, inexperience and the language barrier, and claim to be able to help them,' says Philli Boyle, from the charity. `The rumour mill can be very powerful and plays into the hands of ill-intentioned people.' By that, she means traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the camp has been cleared, the migrant crisis has not gone away. It has simply been dispersed over a larger area, making it harder for the volunteers here to do their jobs. `We have a warehouse full of donated tents we are not allowed to give out because it might encourage refugees to set down roots and start another &quot;Jungle&quot;,' says Boyle. `And at the same time we are struggling to keep up with demand for blankets and bedding, because almost every morning the police are pepper spraying it to force people to get up and move on.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees estimates that there are 200 unaccompanied minors in the region, most of whom are trying to make it to the UK. The chances of them doing so are slim, given the decision by Amber Rudd in February of this year to axe the Dubs Amendment. This piece of legislation was named after Lord Dubs, the peer who campaigned for the scheme after his own experiences of coming to the UK from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia during the Second World War on the Kindertransport. The legislation promised that the UK would give sanctuary to the most vulnerable child refugees. When it was passed in May 2016,it was estimated that up to 3,000 would be helped by the time it had ended less than a year later, just 200 children had beenbrought to safety. The last hope is Help Refugees' challenge to the closure of this scheme, in a judicial review this month. Today, even those who have a legal right to join a family member in the UK struggle to get their case heard. Marwan* is a 17-year-old boy from Mosul in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been waiting to join his uncle in Birmingham since November. The process is long and drawn out. He spends his days in an accommodation centre in Dunkirk, under the care of Safe Passage, another organisation that helps unaccompanied child refugees and vulnerable adults. He is not allowed to leave, lest he go missing and try to make the dangerous crossing over the border on his own. Help Refugees knows of three children and one young woman who have died trying to make their way to England, even though they were entitled to join their families there and were already engaged in the legal process of doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marwan himself has attempted to make the perilous journey several times. On one occasion he snuck into a refrigerator truck full of chicken: when the border police found him, his leg was frozen to a wall. `It is a bad, bad thing,' he tells me. `I have been nearly a year here, and sometimes I cannot believe that the road to England is only half an hour. You stay here for months and months and nobody talks to you. You are alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You become crazy.' His last roommate attempted suicide just days ago. We meet the day after the terror attack in Manchester, which claimed 22 lives. What would he say to the politicians and people who believe that all those trying to claim asylum in the UK are trouble? `I would say come on our journey, see what we are suffering.' He pauses, looks at his plate. `I would say that we are running away from the same thing your children are running away from.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the woods surrounding a highway in Dunkirk, an overnight camp has just been cleared by riot police. Refugees mill around lethargically, waiting for the evening, when they can attempt to cross the border under the cloak of darkness. Every day is the same here, an almost neverending cycle of hope and despair: will this be the night that they make it to the UK without being discovered by sniffer dogs? The people here are reliant on smugglers and traffickers; they live on charity handouts and rumours of fellow migrants who have made it across the Channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find a young pregnant Iraqi lying underneath a tree with her husband. Like a modern-day Romeo and Juliet, they were threatened with death by their families for falling in love across tribal lines. The 21-year-old woman lost her first baby in labour while trying to reach Europe she is now around four months pregnant with her second child, and clearly not well, though she refuses to go into sheltered accommodation in Dunkirk for fear of being made to seek asylum here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple tell me that, a few nights before, they hid on a truck for several hours without water. The dogs found them at the final checkpoint. `The British officers were kind but the French police were not,' says the man. `When my wife asked to go to the toilet, they refused her. We have thought about settling in France but it is such a bad situation here. We expected to be treated humanely in Europe, but it is no better than in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, if they want to kill you, they just shoot you. Here, they slowly beat you down. We have lost everything. We are losing our minds.' This is the reason so many refuse to seek asylum in France their only experiences of the authorities have been negative ones. `It is like a bad fairy tale,' says Michael McHugh, the coordinator of the Refugee Youth Service's Child Protection Team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">`These are future citizens who should be nurtured, but instead the police try to break them with batons and tear gas. I've heard of the authorities taking children's shoes and footballs just for the sake of it. They are living with normalised violence from the police. The UK system is much harder to get into, but it is fairer and more child-focused. They see Britain as their Willy Wonka golden ticket.' At 4pm every day, volunteers from charities including Help Refugees, Refugee Community Kitchen and Gyn&eacute;cologie Sans Fronti&Egrave;res travel to the `distribution centre', a piece of scrubland near the site of the former Jungle. They hand out food and provisions to the estimated 700 migrants still in the area, including young families living in dilapidated shipping containers. It is here that we finally find Sara and Bibi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are wary of strangers, and don't want to talk to us. We hand them bags of toiletries and hygiene products donated by Superdrug. Suddenly they are swarmed on by male refugees who try to take the toiletries away. The translator stops them. The photographer and I move closer, show Sara and Bibi what is in the bags sanitary towels, toothbrushes, strawberry-scented shower gel. Finally, on the condition that their faces are not shown in photographs, they agree to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both girls have paid in the region of 7,000 to smugglers to make it this far their parents sold all their possessions in the hope of getting them to the UK. Neither girl knows what has become of her family. Both have experienced FGM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bibi has taken on the role of protector she worries about Sara. `I know about boys,' she says to me. `I was married when I was 11. At 14, I lost my baby. I have experience since then. I know that they are dangerous, that they are animals. But Sara is only 17.' Her friend stares blankly into space, picking at the grass. `All men are very dangerous,' repeats Bibi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I tell her that isn't true. `Your husband is only good because you had his baby,' she says, sadly. `But here, some of the other boys, the police, they all make me sleep with them.' I am astonished by this claim of rape at the hands of the police, but am told by volunteers that `protection sex' is common, whereby a woman consents to sex with someone (either a French policeman or a fellow refugee) so that she is not raped by others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young boys are also at risk of this. It is not uncommon for young girls to claim that traffickers are their protectors, their older brothers. It seems almost inconceivable that all of this is happening just an hour's train journey from the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Bibi and Sara want to start a new life in the UK. They too refuse to go into sheltered accommodat ion nearby, afraid of being made to claim asylum here all they have seen of France is violence. They ask if they can show us where they are currently sleeping, and ask us not to reveal their location. `We will be beaten for it,' they explain. The girls show us the filthy tent in the woods that they share with around 19 boys. `We protect them,' one boy says to me, as we wade through litter and discarded underwear, but I am not sure I believe him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the afternoon wears on, it becomes clear that the girls are not safe here. The team at Gyn&eacute;cologie Sans Fronti&Egrave;res tell us they can offer them three nights in a safe house, but only on the condition that they do not tell anyone where they are going and agree to turn off phone tracking on the mobiles distributed by Refugee Youth Service. `Traffickers often find them this way,' explains a volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We ask Bibi and Sara if they will consider going so that they can rest safely in a proper bed with the protection of a roof and a door. The girls start to cry. `We will go but we will not give them our fingerprints,' weeps Bibi. These are tears of both relief and fear. Later, I am told that the girls spent just one night in the safe house before leaving to try to reach England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Bibi and Sara get to the UK, what awaits them? A warm home, a friendly welcome, a new life? Most likely, they will end up unaccounted for, their fates erased by traffickers. They will not see their families again. They will not find safe passage. If they are very lucky, they will continue to have each other. But this is not a definition of luck most of us would recognise. As we watch them go with Gyn&eacute;cologie Sans Fronti&Egrave;res, the riot police arrive with batons and guns. They are here to clear the area, to force the refugees back into the woods. Out of sight. Out of mind.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rape and sexual assault is feared to be significantly underreported because of the fear of retribution and stigma, while administrative backlogs can cause long delays before victims can be moved away from their abusers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee womencan make &quot;deals&quot; with men from their home countries in exchange for safety inside detention camps, where overcrowding, outbreaks of violence and a lack of security and facilities leave them vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Athens, Thessaloniki and other cities, refugees tend to live in open camps or informal settlements, where adolescents may be preyed on by older men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children desperate to raise money or find shelter also seek to sell sex themselves, particularly in notorious parks in Athens where they wait to be approached by paedophiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Harvard study found that the purchasers of migrant child sex were mainly men over 35, while children engaging in &quot;survival sex&quot; are mainly teenage boys, particularly from Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some refugees have been trapped in Greek camps for more than a year (AP)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elderly men offer food and shelter to children,&quot; an informant told researchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are willing to satisfy the children's basic needs in exchange for sexual services, but the children want money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some purchasers demand children to accompany them to their homes or meet at a hotel, the report said, while others insist on having sex in a park such as the notorious Pedion tou Areos (Field of Ares) in Athens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report found prices &quot;rarely exceed (EURO)15 (&pound;13) per exchange&quot;. With smugglers hiking fees as borders and fences have gone up across Europe, prospects of escaping Greece are fading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One child said he had &quot;given up the hope of finding a way out of Greece, but other boys are still trying to collect the money to leave&quot;, while another told journalists: &quot;I never thought I'd have to do something like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the money ran out, I had to learn to do this...it was the first time I did this, I had no experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers expect the situation to worsen as refugees remain trapped in Greece for ever-lengthening periods and relocation programmesincluding a British schemeare scrapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the first 10 months of 2016, more than 10,400 children applied for asylum in Greece, mostly from Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and other Middle Eastern and north African nations, creating huge backlogs in an unprepared system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by the end of the year only 2,413 migrant children - 11 per cent of those stranded in the country - had been successfully relocated to other European countries despite 160,000 slots being promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8203;</SPAN>Marleen Korthals Altes, a senior child protection adviser at Save the Children, said the closure of borders through the Balkans routehad increased the risk of sexual violence and exploitation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Korthals Altes said that although child protection is heavily legislated in Greece, laws are &quot;inconsistently applied&quot; by overwhelmed authorities, adding: &quot;The policies and the practices are different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Harvard report identified six major risk factors needing to be urgently addressed - the lack of children's facilities, risky living conditions inside camps, unsupervised mixing of migrant adults and children, under-resourced child protection systems, a lack of coordination among authorities and a &quot;radically inadequate&quot; relocation scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its authors, Vasileia Digidiki and Jacqueline Bhabha, concluded that EU policies were exacerbating risks by forcing the youngest and most vulnerable refugees to turn to smugglers and take desperate measure to meet their extortionate fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While more migrants are dying in treacherous attempts to reach Europe than ever before,political will to help survivors is waning, they noted, adding: &quot;National and international stakeholders should come together to ensure adequate prevention measures, as well as to create safe and legal paths to migration for migrant children in acute need of protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>

David Williamson reports</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE decision to close a scheme to bring unaccompanied refugee children to the UK has triggered an outcry in Wales and united leaders of different faith traditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 350 young people will come to Britain under a scheme pushed for by Lord &quot;Alf&quot; Dubs, a veteran of the Kindertransport, which rescued 669 children from the Nazis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are an estimated 90,000 unaccompanied children across Europe and supporters of the scheme had hoped around 3,000 would find a new home here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catholic Archbishop of Cardiff George Stack criticised the decision to wind up the iconic scheme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I regret very much that the commitment to receive these unaccompanied children is not being honoured. We have a moral and humanitarian duty to accept them. And Jesus did say, 'Let the children come to me...'&quot; The UK government has defended the decision to bring an end to the scheme, arguing it &quot;encourages the people-traffickers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Anglican Bishop of Swansea and Brecon, John Davies, said the 200 young people who have been allowed to come to the UK under the scheme so far represented a &quot;drop in the He about and from and since just seek they persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ocean&quot;. e said: &quot;The Dubs Amendment is ut providing security, safety shelter to children, driven m their homes by conflict, who have been in Europe ce March 2016. They have not arrived, and all that they k is a place of refuge, where y can be free from fear and secution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;encouraging does likelihood &quot;ar&quot;So, this debate is not about ouraging more to arrive, nor s it risk increasing the lihood of trafficking. These children' on our borders now and they deserve our help now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wales has a proud record of providing sanctuary to those in need; and to disregard the plight of these children, by putting the Dubs Amendment on hold, is an unwelcome blemish on that proud record. &quot;We must demonstrate our compassion and solidarity with those who so desperately need our help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dai Hankey, who leads Red Community - a charity that seeks to stand against human trafficking in Wales - condemned the UK government's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing that children will fall prey to human traffickers, he said: &quot;I would have to say that as a human, as a Christian and as a father, I am both gutted and disgusted by the UK government's recent decision to wind up the Dubs Amendment scheme. Sadly, rather than responding to the needs of some of the world's most vulnerable children with courage and compassion, I fear that our gutless government has buckled under the pressure of rising xenophobia and raging nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I live in the cultural melting-pot of Cardiff's inner city and have many good friends, young and old, who are currently seeking asylum. They are not terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are not scroungers. They are hurting people in need of hope and grace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sincerely pray that the government reverses its decision and that desperate children who are fleeing all manner of horrors might find sanctuary in a truly Great Britain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saleem Kidwai, of the Muslim Council of Wales, said people in Wales were ready to act as foster parents and open their homes to the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are willing to adopt and people are willing to help them,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think it will be much pressure on the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judith Morris, the general secretary of the Baptist Union of Wales, has asked churches to write to Home Secretary Amber Rudd to express &quot;disappointment and opposition&quot; over the plans to wind up the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Last year I had the privilege of visiting Greece as part of an all-women delegation from Churches Together in Britain and Ireland to see first hand the reality faced by the refugees. Many of those whom we met were women and children who were seeking reunification with their husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the visit we learnt about the risks faced by women in particular and unaccompanied children. It is shocking and shameful that we are not doing more to help those children in particular who are in such vulnerable situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our duty and responsibility to assistance and to help as an of our Christian witness offer assist expression for those who are facing times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support to keep the scheme also came from Geraint general secretary of the Welsh Independents, represents Christians in 430 chapels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and love f desperate t Strong su running a Tudur, the Union of which repr Welsh chap He said: sands of children' ar Europe is governmen 'British val little valu of there open to kinds of &quot;Clai about ness o for th quest hon ing &quot;The thought that thousands unaccompanied refugee are roaming the streets of heartbreaking. The UK government constantly speaks about 'values' but evidently places value on the lives and welfare refugee children, who are people-trafficking and all manipulation and abuse. &quot;Claims by the government the capacity and willingness of local authorities to care these children are highly questionable... Wales has an honourable tradition of taking in refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should welcome these children with open arms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huw Thomas, of Christian Aid Wales, was concerned about the &quot;very worrying signal&quot; the closure of the scheme would send to the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;A clear promise was made back in the summer that Britain would be shouldering its share of child refugees. Going back on that commitment sends a worrying signal in terms of international cooperation at a time when with the backdrop of Brexit and Donald Trump we should be saying we want to fulfil our international obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is a moral imperative for wealthy countries to take their fair share of child refugees, not leave it to Italy and Greece to shoulder the burden. We also need to remember that the vast majority of refugees in general are hosted in some of the world's poorest countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Thomas added: &quot;As far as our experience of communities in Wales goes, there is a huge amount of concern and a huge amount of willingness [to] welcome child refugees and refugees in general. I think that plays into the traditional and well-known Welsh sense of welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Theresa May would do well to listen to communities in Wales, and indeed, religious leaders in Wales who are speaking out on this issue and demanding the British government do what they originally committed to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Welsh Refugee Council described the 350 cap on the number of children who will be helped as &quot;pitifully low&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman said: &quot;Where push factors of conflict, poverty and desperation remain, closing safe and legal routes for protection means that children will be more vulnerable to unscrupulous and exploitative practices such as trafficking and prostitution. The Dubs scheme represents an opportunity to provide a safe route and sanctuary to a small number of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is disappointing and, we feel, unjustified to see the UK government withdrawing its commitment to even that small number...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dubs scheme is supported by our Welsh Government as an opportunity to welcome more vulnerable child refugees to Wales. The people of Wales have strong humanitarian instincts and a proud record promoting the rights of children, as well as offering sanctuary to refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hywel Williams, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, also urged the Prime Minister to perform a U-turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Theresa May is scrapping a scheme set up specifically to rescue refugee children in Europe - the most desperate and vulnerable people on our continent... She should scrap her government's plans to abandon child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Westminster has been far too reluctant to act throughout this humanitarian crisis. Canada, a country with half the population of the UK, took over 35,000 Syrian refugees in 2016 alone. Germany took around 300,000. &quot;The UK's commitments are shameful by comparison. These desperate children are alone in a foreign country seeking shelter from war, persecution and famine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Minister Carwyn Jones has written to Theresa May and asked her to reverse the decision, stating the Welsh Government is &quot;currently investing &pound;350,000 in building social services capacity to ensure additional places for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children can be identified&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the Welsh Local Government Association said the umbrella group for Wales' councils had not been informed of the UK government's plans to close the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Welsh councils across all parts of Wales have been working hard to resettle refugees as part of the UK contribution to the current humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Home Office is operating a number of schemes and programmes, and authorities will decide the level of their participation dependent upon a number of local factors, such as capacity, resources and ability to assist. A significant number of unaccompanied and vulnerable children and young people have been resettled in Wales over the recent period, some arriving with their families under the Syrian Resettlement Scheme or the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More recently, following UK government commitments, a smaller number of children have been resettled under the Dubs Amendment and following the closure of the 'Jungle' camp in Calais. Each placement must be made with the best interests of the child as an underpinning principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were not previously aware of the UK government's plan to close this scheme and conversations with authorities are continuing as to any additional capacity or placements they may be able to identify for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Europe. We are also working closely with Welsh Government in discussing how we could further develop our approach in Wales to supporting vulnerable children arriving and their integration into local communities.&quot; The UK government insists it is &quot;not giving up on vulnerable children who are fleeing conflict and danger&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It argues that in the last fortnight &quot;more than 300 refugees have arrived in the UK&quot; and &quot;around half of these were children&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government says &quot;more than 8,000 children&quot; found &quot;shelter, security and safety&quot; here in the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds it is committed to resettling up to 3,000 vulnerable children and their families from the Middle East and North Africa and 20,000 Syrian refugees by the end of this parliament.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new US President last night ordered a four-month ban on all refugees entering the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump also said no visas will be issued to nationals from seven mainly-Muslim nations of Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban has sparked outrage among many international organisations and Americans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some US official told him that Trump canceled all visas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were also reportedly barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York today, sources at Cairo airport said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has also reportedly recalled its staff who are travelling abroad back to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Bloomberg News, a memo to staff says more than 100 of its staff are affected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also reports of Syrians who have given up everything who are trapped at US airports and unable to enter the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,&quot; Trump said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump bans ALL refugees from entering the US for four months and Syrian refugees indefinitely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has this morning condemned the ban while civil rights groups have said the order is harmful and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Join the conversation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filmmaker Michael Moore said: &quot;That the President of the United States would order on Holocaust Memorial Day the banning of a people due to their religion is reprehensible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump claimed the move would keep America safer, despite evidence which shows none of the countries on the list have been the source of terror attacks on US soil since 9/11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having given no notice of the ban, it caused chaos for thousands of Arab-American families who already had family members en route to visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were reports of Syrian families who have spent up to two years being vetted for a visa left stranded at the airport having sold all their possessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Trump chose Holocaust Memorial Day to make the announcement was all the more upsetting for many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,&quot; Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican senator Seth Moulton, an Iraq War veteran, said: &quot;President Trump is leading our country out of fear instead of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His executive orders banning refugees and immigrants from some Muslim majority countries to the United States plays right into the hands of our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ISIS has already used his statements to help recruit new suicide bombers, and you can bet Trump's policies will help inspire attacks against Americans both at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His policies literally put our troops' live at risk - I've heard this loud and clear when I have visited them overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also prove he has zero understanding of our country's values and no intention of defending out constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of immigrants, and America is stronger when we welcome the refugees of our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These policies do no not put America first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am ashamed he is our president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a statement: &quot;I am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and father fleeing violence and war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants - the people who helped build your country, ready to work in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am heartbroken that Syrian refugee children, who have suffered through six years of war by no fault of their own, are singled out for discrimination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups have condemned the order as harmful and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Extreme vetting is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,&quot; American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Identifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favoring or discriminating against particular religions,&quot; Romero said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Trump said that Syrian Christians will be given priority when it comes to applying for refugee status, a policy that would likely be challenged on similar grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians,&quot; Trump said in an excerpt of an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, discussing the Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics provided by the Pew Research Center last October do not support Trump's argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pew research found that 38,901 Muslim refugees entered the United States in fiscal year 2016 from all countries, almost the same number, 37,521, as Christian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Legomsky, a former Chief Counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, said prioritising Christians could be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump's move would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a completely plausible prioritisation, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,&quot; Spiro said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order temporarily suspends the United States' main refugee programme which helped around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected to affect two programmes U.S. lawmakers created a few years after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to help the tens of thousands of Iraqis who risked their lives helping Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump says the order is necessary to prevent Islamist militants from coming to the United States posing as refugees, but refugee advocacy groups say the lengthy screening of applicants by multiple U.S. agencies makes this fear unfounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners said Britain should move to step up and help Syrian refugees in the wake of Trump's ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said: &quot; We're appalled that President Trump is closing the door to refugees fleeing terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Restricting America's role in resettlement in the middle of the worst refugee crisis on record will have a huge impact on this vital global programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the world's most vulnerable people will be left struggling to survive in camps and on the borders of conflict zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thankfully we know Britain is better than this. Now is the time to step up and increase our commitment to protect those forced to flee war and persecution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Theresa May is facing a growing backlash after refusing to condemn Donald Trump's immigration restrictions - as one of her MPs revealed the rules would stop him entering the US.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ban prevents people from seven nations</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - including wartorn Syria - from entering the US for 90 days. Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen are also affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraq-born Nadhim Zahawi, the MP for Stratford-on-Avon, tweeted: &quot;Had confirmation that the order does apply to myself and my wife as we were both born in Iraq. Even if we are not dual nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a British citizen &amp; so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear I'll be banned from the USA based on my country of birth.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had been told by a US immigration lawyer friend that the ban applied because he and his wife were both originally Iraqi nationals, despite both now having British passports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zahawi added: &quot;A sad, sad day to feel like a second-class citizen. Sad day for the USA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May initially dodged a question about her view on the new restrictions from Sky's Faisal Islam, but when pressed she insisted it was up to the US government to devise its own policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour and Conservative MPs reacted with horror to the policy announced by Mr Trump - and Mrs May's reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other world leaders, including Canada's Justin Trudeau and French President Francois Hollande have condemned the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outspoken Tory MP Heidi Allen tweeted the Prime Minister directly to say: &quot;Strong leadership means not being afraid to tell someone powerful when they're wrong. It's an ethos this country is proud of Theresa May.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: &quot;Back from Copeland to read of the US ban on migrants from Muslim countries. Both wrong in itself and very worrying for the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: &quot;President Trump's executive order against refugees and Muslims should shock and appal us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Theresa May should have stood up for Britain and our values by condemning his actions. It should sadden our country that she chose not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Trump's hideous actions and May's weak failure to condemn them, it's more important than ever for us to say to refugees seeking a place of safety, that they will always be welcome in Britain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mrs May declined to speak out at a press conference in Ankara, her counterpart in Turkey - a country with a dismal record on human rights - hit out at the US for the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When pressed by journalists, Mrs May eventually said: &quot;The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom's policy on refugees and our policy on refugees is to have a number of voluntary schemes to bring Syrian refugees into the country, particularly those who are most vulnerable, but also to provide significant financial contributions to support refugees in countries surrounding Syria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MP Sarah Wollaston joined the chorus of discontent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Mr Trump must not be invited to address both Houses of Parliament from Westminster Hall on his state visit later this year, pointedly insisting that &quot;those who wish to fawn over him&quot; should do so elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslim ban applies for 90 days to allow the Department of Homeland Security and intelligence services to carry out vetting - including for those who are already in the US. Refugees have already been detained at US airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mrs May landed back in London, a Downing Street source said: &quot;We will always find ourselves in agreement on some things and disagreement on other things.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH the political drama in Britain dominating the news it would be easy to think that the mass migration from North Africa to Europe had all but ceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, the EU did a deal with Turkey last year in which Turkey agreed to take back migrants who had made the short dash across the Aegean in return for European countries agreeing to take an equal number of Syrian refugees from camps in Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as many British tourists who head to the Mediterranean over the next few weeks will discover, the Turkey deal has not ended the problem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On other routes the migration continues apace. In just four days 9,000 migrants have arrived in Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Priority for Europe has to be stopping migrant boats - EXPRESS COMMENT  Italy threatens to close docks to migrant rescue boats as EU fails  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides that, a new migration route has been established between Morocco and Spain, which over the past week has seen 1,000 arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tragically, as in Greece, bodies are beginning to wash up on Spanish beaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the Mediterranean as a whole 2,000 are estimated to have drowned this year. We cannot go on tolerating this human tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in Greece we must find a humane way of stopping people boarding boats in the first place. Italy yesterday made a start by threatening to close its ports to non-Italian-registered, migrant-carrying ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrants rescued while attempting to cross the Mediterranean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these vessels are operated by charities which, while well-meaning, are thoroughly misguided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy's move is certainly a beginning, although Europe needs a co-ordinated approach to go further still and shut down these migration routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It goes without saying that we can and must continue to do whatever we can to search for these boats and to rescue their human cargos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But once migrants have been saved from the unseaworthy vessels they have boarded in North African countries they should in almost all cases be returned to the countries from whence they set sail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we must stop doing, on the other hand, is providing a ferry service across the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens at the moment is that migrants saved from sinking boats a few miles off the North African coast are then being brought the rest of the way to Europe in safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By providing this service we are encouraging a criminal racket which has caused a huge number of deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some in Britain who romanticise the great migration across the Mediterranean, who see the migrants as heroes who, if allowed to, will become enterprising and patriotic citizens of Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libyan coast guardsman stands on a boat during the rescue of people attempting to reach Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases this is no doubt true but it shouldn't detract from the fact that the migration is run by criminal gangs who care not one jot for their victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will tackle these traffickers only by closing down their business. Instead we are colluding with them. There is another common fallacy that all those who attempt to make it to Europe are refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some arriving from Syria or the lawless parts of chaotic, post-Gaddafi Libya certainly do deserve that description.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others may have started their journeys as refugees in places such as Somalia. But many others are more accurately described as economic migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those arriving in Spain in recent months are reported to have come from Senegal, which is one of the most stable African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course many Senegalese could improve their lives and their health by migrating to European countries which offer a far better standard of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that is no basis for claiming asylum, which is supposed to be for people who are genuinely fleeing in fear of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we did recognise the right of people to settle wherever they liked, and to enjoy the full rights of citizenship, including access to welfare and healthcare, Europe would very quickly be overwhelmed. And while economic migrants were allowed to pursue a better life, genuine refugees would be forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferrying migrants across the Mediterranean might be helping some refugees lucky enough to survive journeys in traffickers' boats but for too long Europe has been looking at the refugee problem from the wrong end of the telescope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate has become fixated on people crossing the Mediterranean and indeed the English Channel when we should really be asking what more could we do to help refugees much closer to the source of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the Syrian crisis Britain has followed by far the most logical and humane approach of any European country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have contributed far more than any other to the running of refugee camps in countries bordering Syria, while at the same time erecting barriers to discourage migrant flows into Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a lot more that Europe could be doing to help refugees. Disgracefully the UN Food Programme had to reduce its operations in Lebanon for want of donations from wealthy countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We cannot go on tolerating this human tragedy' says Ross Clark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We could certainly take more refugees from Syria but we should take them directly from camps in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That way we ensure we are really helping refugees, not economic migrants, and also discourage the people traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year in its deal with Turkey the EU finally caught up with the logic. It is high time it went further and closed down the lethal trade in migrants across the Mediterranean for good.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMENT; Pg. 30</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boris Johnson has celebrated the efforts of countries like Lebanon for bearing the brunt of the refugee crisis at the Syrian aid conference in Brussels this week. To date Lebanon has taken in 1.5 million Syrian refugees over the course of the county's six-year civil war, with displaced Syrians now making up a quarter of the country's population. The UK, in contrast, has taken in just 6,000 refugees - including, shamefully, just 340 out of the 3,000 unaccompanied minors we vowed to take in under the aborted Dubs Amendment. If taking in millions makes you a moral example to the international community, what does taking in a few thousand do? Perhaps Johnson should consider that before opening his mouth and blowing out more hot air.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK's agreed strategy toward Syria is to provide aid over resettlement. Since 2012, it has committed &pound;2.3bn to the humanitarian crisis: as well as funds being sent directly to improve the conditions on the ground in Syria, &pound;463m of that aid has gone to Lebanon, &pound;423m to Jordan, &pound;317m to Turkey as well as Iraq and Egypt. The aim is to provide humanitarian assistance to refugees at the regional level so that they are discouraged from making the journey to Europe. The same logic forms the basis of the EU-Turkey deal, which allows Greece to return refugees to Turkey, from where EU countries would organise their resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A problem out of sight is a problem out of mind, but it's still a problem. Take Lebanon, the largest recipient of UK aid outside of Syria. Unlike Jordan and Turkey, there are no formal camps in Lebanon, with all aid provided by a civil society who are no longer able to cope with the demands on their resources. At the state level, Lebanon is barely able to care for its own population. It is a country with its own long-term infrastructure problems (water and electricity shortages are frequent), and seeing its population increase by 25 per cent in just six years has taken its toll. Schools are struggling to cope with new and often traumatised pupils; overcrowding and a lack of sanitation are putting a strain on the country's health service; and Lebanon's annual economic growth has slowed from 8 per cent to an average of 1 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon's PM Saad Hariri has spoken of the growing fear of tension between Lebanese and Syrian communities, and the development of civil unrest. This is a country that has for years strived to disassociate itself from foreign policy controversies in the region, and is still working to heal the rifts of war in its own society - to put this into perspective, an estimated six out of ten households still own an automatic weapon. Add millions of refugees, with minimal support, to the equation and you can see how easily the balance could be tipped in favour of widespread discontent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, what are a few more thousand refugees to a relatively stable and affluent country like the UK? The UK has vowed to take in 20,000 refugees by 2020, but in the current political context, this seems highlight unlikely, especially given the Conservative Government's inclination to U-turn on such matters. If Boris Johnson really admired the efforts of Syria's neighbours so much, he might want to put his money where his mouth is and lobby for the UK to take in its fair share, thus making Britain a similar &quot;moral example&quot; within Europe. Sadly, his bit-part in Brexit has made such a project way beyond his public profile now.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pias, a young Iraqi refugee who made it to Hungary, was initially keen to show off his English. But after four months in a detention camp, fear and uncertainty had rendered him mute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite paying the Hungarian authorities (EURO)1,200 (&pound;1,018) to send him to a more open facility, the 19-year-old feared being hauled back into custody under a draconian new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drafted by the rightwing government of Viktor Orb&aacute;n, Hungary's strongman prime minister, and passed overwhelmingly by the Hungarian parliament on Tuesday, the measure transfers all asylum applicants to a network of new camps made out of shipping containers. It is due to come into force in a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major intensification of the Orb&aacute;n government's anti-migrant offensive, has been condemned as a flagrant breach of EU law by lawyers and human rights groups, who are urging fellow member states to act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences for refugees like Pias would be particularly onerous. He arrived in Hungary as a refugee last year and was dispatched to one of the country's detention centres - characterised as prisons by critics - before accepting the offer of release to an open reception centre in exchange for a payment, officially described as &quot;bail&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because his asylum application is still being processed, should the new proposal become law Pias could be taken from his current home, a dorm on a shabby backstreet in Budapest, and hauled back to a detention facility. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Pias this would be a doubly cruel blow: the open facility he was originally sent to after paying his &quot;bail&quot; was little more than a network of tents in Kormend, near Hungary's western border with Austria. Human rights groups have called the conditions there inhumane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set back from public view within the grounds of a police training academy on the outskirts of Kormend, the &quot;open&quot; camp consists of seven round tarpaulin tents; there is a pervading smell of burning peat from the makeshift heating. Public and media access is denied. When the Guardian approached the camp gate, a police officer emerged from a nearby cabin and shouted aggressively: &quot;Go, go, go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners have denounced Hungary's practice of charging detainees to transfer them to facilities that are even more primitive. The cash is officially designated as bail and theoretically returnable if asylum seekers meet a pledge not to abscond across the border to another EU member state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Hungarian government has profited from taking bail money off people wanting to be moved from closed detention centres and then they transfer them to places like Kormend, where there is nothing to do and not even proper heating,&quot; said Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungary Helsinki Committee. &quot;It's cynical and disgusting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under pressure, the authorities last month agreed to transfer from Kormend eight refugees who had paid to be released from closed detention centres. They were transferred to a dormitory in Budapest run by Oltalom, an evangelical charity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kormend camp is still open, however, although only five migrants remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Oltalom hostel, there is anxiety that an even worse fatemay lie in store: that refugees and migrants will be rounded up on the streets and put in camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's true we are afraid of the Hungarian government because they could take back our documents,&quot; said Afridi Sohel Khan, 42, a Pakistani refugee from a Taliban-infiltrated region whose five-year subsidiary protection status expires in a few weeks. He too could face detention if it is not renewed, an outcome human rights experts say is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's very sad news for refugees and those who are seeking human rights,&quot; he added. &quot;We are not terrorists and we are not criminals. I didn't come to Hungary for the good life but because I had a problem in Pakistan. We don't have a life here.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhad Osmani, 19, who left his birthplace of Iran because he was not entitled to Iranian citizenship because his parents were Afghan refugees, was more blunt. &quot;If they try to send me to prison, I will be forced to escape to another country like Austria or Germany,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andras Rakos, a social worker at Oltalom, said the situation had become a moral question for the EU. &quot;We are very worried about these people. They are already in enough trouble and it's a great shame what the government is doing to them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the big question is why does the EU let it happen? When they see that what's happening in Hungary is against the values of the EU, they should not send money to this government. Once they stop sending them money, the government will have big trouble and people will stop voting for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orb&aacute;n - who has trumpeted his plans for an &quot;illiberal state&quot; and called for &quot;ethnic homogeneity&quot;, claiming his anti-refugee policy protects European Christianity - appears unfazed by that prospect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent speech, he taunted more liberal western European countries by offering to accept refugee applications from their disaffected citizens angry about the wave of migration. &quot;We shall let in true refugees,&quot; he said. &quot;Germans, Dutch, French and Italians, terrified politicians and journalists who here in Hungary want to find the Europe they have lost in their homelands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners believe Orb&aacute;n is deliberately flouting European law, which demands that every asylum case be treated on its individual merits, as a tactic calculated to keep the migration issue on Hungary's domestic political agenda in the runup to next year's general election. At the same time, they say, he is sending a signal to the estimated 7,000 refugees currently hoping to reach the EU from neighbouring Serbia not to enter Hungary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will also stop asylum seekers being sent back to Hungary under the Dublin regulations, which is extremely important,&quot; said Pardavi of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee. &quot;At least 29,000 transited Hungary in 2016 and if other EU countries wanted to return them, Hungary would be obliged to take them. But with this all-encompassing detention policy, all those EU countries would probably say it would be a grave human rights abuse to send them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This negates the fundamentals of European asylum policy. It's is a grave headache for European institutions and politicians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also a headache for asylum seekers - and a haunting return to the fearful conditions that drove them from their homelands in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was scared of the government in Iran,&quot; said John, a 33-year-old Iranian Christian convert and pro-democracy activist who left the country in 2014 after learning that the authorities were trying to arrest him. &quot;They could take my life, my family, my job. But I can say on behalf of all refugees and asylum seekers here that we are afraid of the Hungarian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are afraid for our futures and the documents the government gave us. We feel Hungary doesn't have a good future in Europe and I was shocked when I saw Vladimir Putin [the Russian president] here recently. I just saw him as a murderer. It's a dangerous time for us and a dangerous path Hungary is travelling on. 100%, people are scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Scottish charity has expanded its school feeding programme into Syria to help children rebuild their lives after the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary's Meals, in partnership with Dorcas, a Dutch relief organisation, is working with six schools in Aleppo, providing almost 1,500 children in the city with a daily meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the charity's simple formula, the school feeding programme is designed to encourage children into the classroom, where they receive a nutritious meal, as well as lessons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After four years of civil war and tens of thousands of deaths, Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow, Mary's Meals' founder and chief executive, said that children were at last able to &quot;regain their lost childhoods&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expansion into Syria follows a pilot programme in Lebanon where the charity began providing daily meals to Syrian refugee children and their Lebanese classmates in a school near Beirut last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon is hosting 1.5 million refugees from Syria. Two-thirds of the refugee children are not in school and 74 per cent of refugee families have very limited supplies of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanese and Syrian mothers volunteer side by side serving the food in the schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme has been extended to reach children at the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee settlement on the southern outskirts of Beirut, bringing the total number of children benefiting from Mary's Meals in Lebanon to 1,430.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amal, 13, fled to Lebanon from eastern Syria last year with her mother and four siblings. She receives Mary's Meals every school day and has been reunited with her father, Omar, who moved to Lebanon three years earlier to find work to support his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the war, Amal had led what seemed like a carefree life. But after the conflict began she had &quot;to dress all in black and cover everything and not show one strand of hair&quot;, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could do nothing any more and we could have no fun. I had to stay at home. I used the internet for fun but I couldn't go out. I was very afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar, her father, said he hoped to return to live in Syria, but only when the country was safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The last time I visited, I saw my brother. He had blood on his shoes and I asked why. He said [Isis] had cut off the heads of three people who lived in the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pullquoteWhat Mary's Meals have offered in school is so useful. What is important is education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't believe him. So, we got on the motorcycle and he showed me. They had cut off their heads and hung them in the middle of the village. They left them there for three days. It was horrifying for the children and the families. We have a big hope to return to Syria but right now there is no hope. What Mary's Meals have offered in school is so useful. What is important is education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr MacFarlane-Barrow first began taking aid convoys to the Balkans in the 1990s, and founded Mary's Meals in 2002. The charity feeds 1.1 million children every day in schools in 14 countries, including Malawi, Liberia, Zambia, Kenya, Haiti, India and South Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that experience had taught him to keep hope alive, even when it seemed easier, after seven years of war in Syria, to give in to despair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We faced that same bleak temptation almost 25 years ago, when this work of ours first began as a response to the horrific conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia,&quot; Mr MacFarlane-Barrow said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, amid the carnage of those wars, I met many resilient people who were living beacons of hope - some of whom have gone on to play leading roles in building better futures for their nations.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artist Anish Kapoor has spoken out against &quot;abhorrent government policies&quot; towards refugees as he was named the recipient of this year's Genesis Prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Turner Prize winner, 62, said he wanted to use the award, which has been dubbed the Jewish Nobel by Time magazine, to highlight the plight of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapoor, who is based in the UK but was born in Bombay to a Baghdadi Jewish mother and Indian father, is donating his one million dollar prize (&pound;800,000) to help refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Kapoor said that he had to &quot;speak out against indifference for the suffering of others&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jewish identity and history have witnessed recurring conditions of indifference, persecution and Holocaust. Repeatedly, we have had to repossess ourselves and re-identify our communities,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As inheritors and carriers of Jewish values it is unseemly, therefore, for us to ignore the plight of people who are persecuted, who have lost everything and had to flee as refugees in mortal danger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sculptor said: &quot;I am an artist, not a politician, and I feel I must speak out against indifference for the suffering of others. There are over 60 million refugees in the world today - whatever the geography of displacement, the refugee crisis is right here on our doorstep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;To lose one's home, one's land, one's sense of belonging, is bewildering. All that is left is one's body... how long before - for so many - even that is lost?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapoor said: &quot;I believe that in the current political climate the world over, it is more important than ever that we continue to stand against the abhorrent government policies that are an offence against our ethics and the very tenets of what it means to be human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Jews, we must question whether this reality is closer to home than we might like, and we must condemn the exclusionist policies and politics of the government that claims to represent us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natan Sharansky, head of the Genesis Prize selection committee, said: &quot;Throughout our history, the Jewish people suffered not only from active and violent anti-Semitism, perpetrated by a minority, but also from the indifference of the majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is this indifference that made persecution, massacres and the Holocaust possible. Anish Kapoor has campaigned against indifference his whole life. His message is clear, powerful, and inspiring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollywood star Michael Douglas, a previous recipient of the award, said: &quot;The current refugee crisis is one that, unfortunately, we all know too well. Anish Kapoor's message that we must not stay silent is powerful and important. His desire to help displaced people resonates with the Jewish people, and all humanity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said: &quot;I am certain that Anish Kapoor's passion and commitment to social justice, as well as his creativity and candour, will increase the level of awareness of the catastrophic situation faced by the Syrian refugees. Genesis Prize could not have selected a better laureate or a more timely issue to focus on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapoor created the Holocaust Memorial for the Liberal Jewish Synagogue in London and the 70 candles for Holocaust Memorial Day in Britain in 2015, commemorating the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prize, awarded by the Genesis Prize Foundation, the Office of the Prime Minister of the State of Israel and the Jewish Agency for Israel, &quot;recognises individuals who have attained excellence and international renown in their fields and whose actions and achievements express a commitment to Jewish values, the Jewish community and the State of Israel&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olympic hero Sir Mo Farah could be banned from returning to his home in America after Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sprinter, who lives with his family in Oregon, is believed to be training in Ethiopia at the moment, and recently tweeted from there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump's immigration crackdown prevents refugees coming into the USA from seven Muslim majority countries for 90 days and those from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban also affects those with dual nationality, who were born in one of the seven countries, returning to the USA if they are currently away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement that the State Department is due to release, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the 90-day visa moratorium extends beyond just citizens of Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also applies to people who originally hail from those countries but are traveling on a passport issued by any other nation, the statement notes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Mo is originally from Somalia and moved to the UK when he was eight-years-old.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he was born in one of the countries President Trump has targeted, travelling on a British passport will not help him return home.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement means Iraqis seeking to enter the U.S. on a British passport, for instance, will be barred, according to a U.S. official. British citizens don't normally require a visa to enter the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Travelers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa,' the statement said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or non-immigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period. Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump defended his tough new immigration bans, and&nbsp;denied that his executive order, which bars refugees and citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US, was a Muslim ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Conservative MP also tweeted to say he is banned from the USA under President Trump's controversial ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadhim Zahawi represents Stratford-on-Avon but both he and his wife were born in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tweeted: 'I'm a British citizen &amp; so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear ill [sic] be banned from the USA based on my country of birth.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: 'Had confirmation that the order does apply to myself and my wife as we were both born in Iraq. Even if we are not dual Nat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A sad sad day to feel like a second class citizen! Sad day for the USA.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban has also already affected an Iranian director nominated for an Oscar, who now won't be able to attend the Hollywood award ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated in the best foreign film category for his movie The Salesman but there are fears he may now not be able to attend next month's Academy Awards, because he was born in Iran.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian-born actress who stars in Farhadi's The Salesman vowed to boycott the Oscars over Trump's immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taraneh Alidoosti, the 33-year-old known as the Natalie Portman of Iran, took to Twitter with a message for fans on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest,' she tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ANTI-IMMIGRATION ORDER DO?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban refugee entries from all countries for 120 days. Refugees can be accepted on case-by-case basis, including&nbsp;if they are a religious minority facing religious persecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Block refugee entries from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap refugee intake at 50,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban visa and immigration entries for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries on banned list, including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspend visa issuance to countries of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian-born Hessam Noorian, who has a British passport and a US Green Card was held at Chicago airport for five hours as he tried to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they asked him several questions, and searched his backpack and possessions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has an Iranian passport and a British passport, and was told possession of the Iranian passport necessitated the questions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took five hours to receive a waiver, he told the Chicago Tribune. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven refugees bound for the U.S. were stopped from boarding a plane in Cairo on Saturday and 12 migrants were detained in New York overnight because they arrived just after the executive order was signed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqi refugees who was detained for 14 hours at New York, was released on Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 53-year-old had arrived in America on a flight from Istanbul on Friday night, just hours after Trump implemented the immigration ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had worked for the U.S. government in Iraq for 10 years as a translator, engineer and contractor and had a valid special immigration visa to relocate to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dual-citizenship ban doesn't apply to U.S. citizens who are also citizens of the seven nations singled out by Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department statement also said such restrictions don't apply to people from those countries traveling on diplomatic visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. consulate in Erbil have stopped accepting visa applications from Iraqi nationals until further notice, except for certain diplomatic exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The urgent steps come as State Department officials try to sort out how to implement Mr. Trump's broadly-worded policy executive order. Officials said they received little information about the ban before it took effect from the Trump team.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One described how a draft of the order was brought in unofficially to the State Department earlier this week to review before it took effect.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, Theresa May repeatedly refused to criticise President Trump's executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At&nbsp;a news conference in Ankara, Prime Minister May said: 'The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.&nbsp;The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom's policy on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And our policy on refugees is to have a number of voluntary schemes to bring Syrian refugees into the country, particularly those who are most vulnerable but also to provide significant financial contributions to support refugees in countries surrounding Syria.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday evening, a Downing St spokesman said&nbsp;Theresa May does 'not agree' with Donald Trump's refugee ban and will make representations if it hits Britons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However just yards away from her, Prime Minister Yildirim was putting the boot in, saying building walls would not help the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: 'We cannot solve this refugee problem by putting up walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We opened our doors, and if they come again, we would take them again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Regional problems cannot be solved by sweeping them under the carpet.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: 'British citizens banned from the US and our government has nothing to say? Disgrace.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Mirror, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: 'Not only is this shocking even by her standards, it cannot be allowed to stand. The President's actions have horrified the world, and this is a moment when she has to show what side she is on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At the press conference she contrived to make the Turkish government look liberal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They said it was wrong to build walls. Rather than fighting to build a world that is open, tolerant and united, Theresa May is dividing the world in a very dangerous way.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order&nbsp;declares that U.S. policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also&nbsp;gives Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year, according to the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Holocaust Memorial Day is a time of great reflection for many of us across the country. Today I will think about the Jewish family members and friends I left behind in Prague when I was put on a train to London Liverpool Street at six years old; about the courage of men and women who helped children such as me escape on the Kindertransport just months before the Nazi occupation; and I will think about the millions killed because they couldn't flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Hungry, scared, and no closer to safety: child refugees failed by Britain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's comforting to think that the world has learned the lessons of history. The international Refugee Convention, forged in the aftermath of the second world war, aspired to a better standard, guaranteeing the basic right of sanctuary for people fleeing persecution and conflict. But this week showed us the fragility of that consensus. As Europe reflects on the catastrophic consequences of inaction, Donald Trump is busy banning refugees fleeing Syria, Iraq, Sudan and other Muslim countries. Men, women and children seeking escape from brutal conflict and persecution, denied sanctuary because they are Muslim. The parallels are frightening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighteen years ago I was privileged to attend a ceremony in parliament to dedicate a small bronze plaque, donated by the committee of the Reunion of Kindertransport, in &quot;deep gratitude&quot; to the people of the United Kingdom for saving the lives of 10,000 Jewish and other children from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia fleeing Nazi persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today I shall stand with the chief rabbi and the archbishop of Canterbury for a ceremony led by the speaker of the House of Commons to rededicate that plaque. Joining us this year will be Sami, a young boy from Syria who fled his homeland to make the dangerous journey to Europe. He spent months alone in the Calais refugee camp before being supported by the charity Safe Passage to join family members in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As attitudes among some in Europe and the US harden towards refugees, it is up to all of us to demonstrate that we do not turn our backs on children such as Sami. That we can continue the legacy set by previous generations when they offered sanctuary rather than walls to those fleeing conflict and persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the chaos of the Calais camp's demolition last year, 200 children were brought to safety in Britain under Section 67 of the Immigration Act - the law eventually passed with widespread public support after a powerful national campaign. This scheme was specifically intended for unaccompanied child refugees in Europe who have no family in Britain or elsewhere in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a start; but there is far more still to do. Sir Nicholas Winton rescued 669 children virtually single-handedly from Czechoslovakia - as a country we can do more. In Greece, 25,000 children are still stuck in makeshift refugee camps in freezing temperatures with virtually no heating. In Italy, unaccompanied children suffering deep trauma are sleeping in doorways and squats because the children's centres are full. Britain has so far only helped seven children from these countries, and none under the terms of Section 67. This year, we must turn the hundreds of children assisted into thousands, by helping children from Greece and Italy too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Kindertransport, 75 years on: 'It was fantastic to feel free at last'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we remember great moments in history, they can seem lofty and distant. But the Kindertransport happened because of ordinary people who pooled their resources and offered to help. Winton, to whom I owe my life for rescuing me from Prague, used to say: &quot;If something is not impossible, then there must be a way to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the world many countries are closing their doors to refugees. Winton's words should remind us that it was the actions of ordinary people that have kept Britain's longstanding humanitarian tradition alive - today, again, we can do more.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was born and grew up in a refugee camp in Bethlehem and I now teach children who are traumatised by the long-running conflict in Palestine. That history made the stories of the children who have recently arrived in the UK from Syria particularly moving for me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the first day of my visit to the UK last November, I heard some truly harrowing tales from youngsters who have left family behind, been forcibly torn from their homelands and have witnessed appalling savagery and death. In short, none were things that should ever be encountered by children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could identify completely with their personal testimonies of hardship and the almost unimaginable scale of their suffering. At a Global Teacher Prize forum in London at the headquarters of the Varkey Foundation, which awards the prize, these children poured their hearts out in front of education professionals, politicians and media representatives. One, 16-year-old Kabir, whose parents and cousins were dead and his brother severely injured, had no choice but to leave his ruined country to join his sister in London. His parents' dream was that he should get an education. &quot;Even though my parents have now passed away, I want to fulfil their dream of me being someone and getting an education,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heart-rending stories</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of us in the room were moved to tears as we heard the heart-rending stories that these boys had to tell about the horrors they had witnessed and the sheer bravery they had shown as vulnerable children. After struggling for thousands of miles across Europe to get to the infamous &quot;Jungle&quot; camp in Calais, Kabir finally reached Britain with the help of the charity Safe Passage UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Settling into life in the UK, however, involved further complications, including a complete lack of information, meaning that his place at college wasn't confirmed for six months. Another of the children said that he had missed four years of his education. &quot;My fear is of a lost generation - people who have never seen the inside of a classroom,&quot; 17-year-old Mohammed told us. &quot;They're lost and I'm worried for my country because of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing is more important for these children, who have literally fled for their lives to find a safe haven in the UK and other compassionate European countries, than their education. &quot;I want an education&quot; - it is such a modest thing to ask. These children do not want much from us, and this we should be able to give. Education is a fundamental human right and is essential for the exercise of all other human rights, as the United Nations rightly says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I told the children whom I met that they needed to keep speaking up about the horrors they had experienced, and about their simple desire for an education. Only when people truly realise the human cost of these conflicts will there ever be enough popular pressure on the politicians who have the real power to bring them to an end. These same politicians have the levers of power over our education and must understand how badly these children want to be educated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is not going away. As the UN refugee agency UNHCR has said, while 91 per cent of children around the world attend primary school, this rate falls to just 50 per cent among refugee children. Some 84 per cent of adolescents around the world attend secondary school, while just 22 per cent of refugee adolescents get a secondary education; 34 per cent of young people around the world go to university, but just 1 per cent of refugee children do so. They suffer this disadvantage in their most important, formative years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opportunity for children to learn should not be allowed to wither away when they are forced to flee their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make the politicians listen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On my trip to England, I opened the London Stock Exchange and spoke at the University of Cambridge. At both, I saw comparative affluence all around me being taken for granted by those fortunate enough to have grown up with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been acutely aware of an inescapable truth: as the world speeds forward technologically and economically, we need to understand that by failing to educate refugee children, we are recklessly squandering human capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as being wrong, it is self-defeating. Educated children grow up to make a major contribution to their societies and to the world as a whole, turning away from the pull of extremism and so many other negative influences that they are faced with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, before many refugee children are in a position to learn, we need to treat the trauma they have experienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities need the budgets to deal with this; they should never have to choose between providing social care for frail adults and supporting vulnerable refugee children. Here in the UK, the one thing teachers have that refugee children do not is a powerful voice, and the ear of politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must all make those people in power understand the destructive costs of failing to educate these refugee children. We must not let them down.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIKE everyone else, grandfather Aidan Crawford was horrified when he saw the shocking images of Syrian refugee children fleeing for their lives on TV. But unlike most people, he acted to help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past two years, the Ballymena man has been part of a small team that has so far managed to send an astonishing &pound;30million of vital supplies to suffering families in camps in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aidan has also devoted the past 21 years to serving the most vulnerable people in the local community as a volunteer with St Vincent de Paul, and for the past five years has served as charity president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was easy to honour Aidan for his tireless work for others by presenting him with our Charity Champion Award, sponsored by Lidl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man with a humble heart who is more content to remain out of the limelight, he was presented with his award by newly crowned world champion Belfast boxer Ryan Burnett and Lidl Northern Ireland, and immediately dedicated it to others who have worked with him to help refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a bit embarrassed but honoured to receive this award,&quot; Aidan said. &quot;I don't do this on my own. The people who work with me do every bit as much as I do and I feel privileged and honoured to get this award. It is for my volunteers and those who have contributed to our work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 65-year-old, a father of four and a grandfather, sadly lost a son five years ago. He is originally from Rasharkin, although he has lived in Ballymena for 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He first got involved with St Vincent de Paul 21 years ago after he was asked by a neighbour to join.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was surprised to discover the extent of the need in his own community and didn't hesitate to help. Since then, he has served as conference president, area president for five years, and regional president, a post that comes to an end this September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity champion has made a huge difference to thousands of people's lives at home and more recently abroad helping refugees. He spent Christmas collecting and distributing aid at a refugee camp in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Aidan, this dedication to others is a normal way of life, but to those who know him, he is a true inspiration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since first seeing the plight of the refugees on TV two years ago, he has tirelessly organised convoys of aid and has also been on aid missions to camps in France and Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aidan was devastated by the level of poverty he witnessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I saw the pictures of the children on TV and their suffering I thought 'Maybe I could do something,'&quot; he said. &quot;We managed to fill four containers with aid and I went out to the islands to help distribute it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we saw was horrific - people in pain and suffering - and we've kept it going ever since. We have sent teams out seven or eight times since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The refugees are being very badly treated and can't even get medical aid. We are trying to help relieve their suffering and pain and give them food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Syria, the children are eating grass. When you see that, it is very hard to turn your back on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We saw people drowning on those death-trap dinghies. When they got off the boats, they had to walk up a mountain to a camp. We weren't allowed to hire buses for them and they had to walk soaking and exhausted, with no food and carrying their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they got to the camp, there was very little left. Children were lying in hedges and on the roadside and mothers were handing their babies to us because they had no food for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I came back home and a lot of us had a lot of sleepless nights, but we decided we had to continue to help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the many refugee support groups throughout the UK, Aidan's, which has a core team of just five people, is one of the biggest, sending to date an astonishing &pound;30million of aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is in the process of establishing the group as a charity in its own right, called Heartship, so it can continue after he steps down as president of St Vincent de Paul in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the international spotlight on the plight of the refugees has somewhat dimmed, the conditions and problems they face are as acute as ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate to see children suffering,&quot; Aidan said. &quot;I look at my grandchildren and if they are sick, we take them to the doctor and get medication for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We met this granny at the camps who was 80 years old and was with grandchildren whose parents had been killed. She was crying and all she wanted was dry clothes for them as they started their journey across Europe. I don't know what became of her and the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The children are innocent and all those people are innocent. They have done nothing, especially the children, who are totally innocent... they are like angels.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Government has admitted that an &quot;administrative error&quot;led to 130 places for child refugees offered by local councils not being taken into consideration as part of the Dubs Amendment scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than two months after the Home Office announced the number of unaccompanied minors brought to the UK under the scheme would be capped at 350, the Immigration Minister issued a statement saying the Government had recently become aware that 130 additional spaces should have been included in the specified number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes after ministers were accused last month of ignoring evidence that local councils were eager to accept more unaccompanied children fleeing conflicts and willing to make thousands more places available following the Government's decision to axed the Dubs scheme, which was initially intended to bring in 3,000 refugees from Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Dubs says he doesn't understand why refugee plan was scrapped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement, issued by Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill on Wednesday, states that the mistake was due to an &quot;administrative error&quot;, which led to 130 places for child refugees pledged by one UK region go unaccounted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my Written Ministerial Statement of 8 February 2017 I announced that, following consultation with local authorities, the Government would transfer the specified number of 350 unaccompanied children from Europe to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016,&quot; read the statement on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government has very recently become aware that, due to an administrative error as part of collating the figures, one region pledged 130 places which were not accounted for in setting the specified number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Goodwill said when the consultation process closed, the Home Office had believed two regions had not provided responses -when in fact one of the regions had pledged to take in 130 children under the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As part of the consultation local authorities were asked to let their Strategic Migration Partnerships know how many places they could offer, and then the Strategic Migration Partnerships provided the regional number to the Home Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Home Office continued to work with the Strategic Migration Partnerships throughout the consultation process, and believed that two regions in England had not provided responses after the consultation closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both of these regions had already stepped up to take a number of children from over-burdened councils elsewhere in the country so it was assumed they would continue to support the national transfer scheme as and when they could, but were not able to provide specific numbers which the Home Office could then allocate to section 67 cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Home Office recently discovered that one of the regions had sent a return and we are now including their pledges in the specified number for the purposes of section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child refugees in northern France 'facing exploitation on daily basis'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Dubs scheme was ended in February, scores of vulnerable, potentially eligible children have continued to live rough in and around Calais, routinely risking their lives by continuing to make dangerous attempts to cross the Channel illegally to reach the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities and campaigners have welcomed Mr Goodwill's announcement that the number is higher than previously thought, but voiced concern that such errors could be being made on a wider scale and subsequently called on the Government to re-consult with councils on capacity and consider re-opening the Dubs scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rabbi Janet Darley who has been working with Citizens UK's Safe Passage project, said: &quot;It is very welcome news that more children will be helped by Alf Dubs' scheme and testament to the hard work of local communities across the country who have worked with councils to find extra places for some of the most vulnerable child refugees in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, if 130 places can be missed due to an administrative error, and many more councils have since come forward and pledged extra spaces, this clearly demonstrates the need to re-consult with councils on capacity and re-open the 'Dubs scheme' so more children can in future benefit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron commented: &quot;This alleged oversight by this Conservative government has meant 130 children who could have been placed here months ago are still languishing in camps in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope these children are identified and brought to the UK as soon as humanely possible - it is our moral duty and responsibility. The Dubs scheme was opened after huge pressure both in Parliament and from the public - we wanted to see 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees offered sanctuary in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whilst I welcome the fact the Government will now take in some more, this is simply not enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, meanwhile said: &quot;This is a welcome but modest step forward. There are far more vulnerable refugee children in Europe in need of protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the run-up to the General Election, we're calling on all parties to make further commitments to continue our country's long tradition of welcoming refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayley Cull, head of campaigns and advocacy at Unicef UK, responded to the news by saying: &quot;This will be a much-needed lifeline for these 130 children. It is vital they reach safety in the UK quickly, so that they can be protected and start to rebuild their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this Dubs lifeline will soon be gone for other children in danger. We still need a long-term plan so that children never have to make dangerous journeys into and across Europe in order to reach safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">854 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 30 Conservative MPs could back a Commons amendment requiring councils in England to declare if they can house unaccompanied child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory backbencher Heidi Allen said she had tabled the amendment to the Children and Social Work Bill following the decision by the Government to close the Dubs child refugee scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers have been widely criticised for shutting the programme, named after the Labour peer Lord Dubs, after just 350 unaccompanied children were resettled, arguing councils could not afford to take the 3,000 called for by campaigners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However Ms Allen said, while some authorities were struggling, others still had the capacity to take more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some councils are absolutely bursting, they cannot take any more. They have done an amazing job. But there are those still stepping forward and we have not taken them up on their offers,&quot; she told the BBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This problem won't go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are thousands of children who won't go away who are in Greece and Italy who have nowhere to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, we can't help them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they are turning to traffickers because legal, safe routes like Dubs have been closed to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will come to northern France and they will become our problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Allen's amendment, which has cross-party support, would require councils to report annually on what capacity they have to resettle children, including unaccompanied refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move has the backing of a number of prominent Tories, including former education secretary Nicky Morgan, and Ms Allen said up to 30 Conservative colleagues could vote for it at the Bill's report stage later on Tuesday, potentially jeopardising the Government's Commons majority of just 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe, as many do in the House of Commons, especially on my side around about 30, that we do need to play our part there,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Local Government Association (LGA) said it has been urging the Government to put in place long-term funding to allow councils to support child refugees while delivering other services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councillor David Simmonds, chair of the LGA's asylum, refugee and migration task group, said: &quot;Councils have an excellent track record of supporting asylum-seeking and refugee children travelling alone and should be commended for how they have responded to looking after more than double the number of unaccompanied children than they did in 2015. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In response to the humanitarian crisis councils have extended a helping hand, with around 90% of local authorities providing care and support for more than 4,000 unaccompanied refugee children in England. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those children who have already been resettled each received an individual package of care to ensure that they settled into their new communities as quickly and easily as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Councils, working with local partners, have also ensured that any ongoing health and care support is provided to those children who experienced horrendous conditions in their country of origin or during their journey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downing Street said the Government had a record of which it was &quot;justifiably proud&quot; when it came to supporting refugees and did not support the amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't think this is the right approach. We think it is right that we focus on protecting the children who are already in the UK. It is also about making sure we don't provide incentives for children to make these perilous journeys,&quot; a No 10 spokesman said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truly, Madly, Deeply actor Juliet Stevenson urged MPs to vote &quot;with their hearts&quot; and commit to accommodating traumatised child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigner also called for Britain to maintain its &quot;long tradition&quot; of offering refuge to people fleeing violence and war, ahead of the vote on the Dubs amendment in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the media before entering Parliament to lobby MPs, she said: &quot;So long as people can't go back to their homes because it's too dangerous to live there then we should be offering them some sanctuary, particularly those who are very young, traumatised, parentless and in many cases, suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome and really, really need the compassion and support of this G overnment and this people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appealing to MPs, she said: &quot;Please vote with your hearts as well as your minds, these children are desperately in need of your support and help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we don't help them they have only two choices, which is to be vulnerable to traffickers who we know are swarming all over Europe. Ten thousand children have already gone missing during the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Or they make these very dangerous journeys and many of them don't survive them. We know how many children have been lost over the course of the last two years and we really, really need to step up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's a really important and significant moment in history to be seen to be showing compassion, which I hope is still part of British people's make-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(The scheme) is already in place since last year and the U-turn that the Government made last month is very shocking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they should go back to the decision that was made last year and commit to bringing those children and allowing the councils to give them places which have been organised.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost two thirds of homeless refugees interviewed said they had been woken up and forced to move, with 54per cent describing the experience as &quot;violent&quot; and saying they were afraid, having been given no reason for the intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One 45-year-old man told researchers an officer kicked him so hard in the shoulder that he was admitted to hospital for the next 20 days for treatment, while others described being tear gassed if they did not move quickly enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one young Afghan man: &quot;If we question them or say we have nowhere to go, they bring out the tear gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman who had been in Paris for a month on her own said: &quot;I live on the streets and have no protection at all. I called 115 three times and they never showed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is so dangerous on the streets. I have no one here, and I am afraid to sleep with so many men around.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half of the refugees interviewed said they were suffering from health problems - including a man who was back on the streets just a day after having his appendix removed - and others suffering from diabetes and mental illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some had heard of other refugees dying in Paris, either of the cold, health problems or in violent attacks. Several refugees reported that a man had been run over crossing the road, while there were unconfirmed claims another had killed himself after despairing of the situation in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He went to the top of a building and jumped off,&quot; a migrant told researchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those interviewed had been living in the French capital for several months, including around a quarter who previously spent time in the Calais &quot;Jungle&quot; and camps in Dunkirk, which were forcibly cleared by authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris opened its first humanitarian centre in November after the closure of a large makeshift camp displaced thousands of migrants, but the facility has been overwhelmed and authorities ploughed ahead with a zero tolerance policy for roadside shelters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around three quarters of all migrants interviewed wanted to stay in France, and under 30 per cent were hoping to reach the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the figure rocketed for children aged 17 and under, with just over half saying they wanted to journey onwards to Britain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They included a 16-year-old boy who had applied to be reunited with his four siblings living in the UK but never received a response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers said almost all minors interviewed were unaccompanied, meaning they may have been eligible for Government transfer under the Dubs Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after taking just 350 children the commitment was quietly scrapped by the Home Office last week, sparking outrage from humanitarian groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Refugee Rights Data Project is calling for &quot;sustainable&quot; efforts by the French government to help get migrants off the streets and combat the &quot;chronic absence of asylum information&quot; that leavesthe majority unaware of their rights or obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity also called for the British Government to &quot;step up and fulfil its moral obligations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers interviewed more than 340 refugees and displaced people sleeping rough in the La Chapelle district of Paris between the 18 and 22 January for the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of respondents were from Afghanistan, followed by Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia and other mainly African countries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees heading to Europe will be urged to settle in Asia and Latin America instead, under a new &pound;30m British aid package. Theresa May announced the scheme at an EU summit in Malta, arguing it showed the Government is &quot;stepping up its support for the most vulnerable refugees&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The package will see Britain provide lifesaving supplies for people facing freezing conditions across Eastern Europe and Greece, including warm clothing, shelter and medical care. However, it will also pay for better infrastructure in far-flung countries willing to take refugees who had hoped to settle in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move builds on an existing scheme run by The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), but it is the first time Britain's aid budget has been used to bolster it. It risks adding to criticism that the Prime Minister is unwilling for the UK to accept a reasonable share of the refugees and migrants fleeing Syria and other war zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a few thousand Syrian refugees have been resettled in Britain - and the Government has refused to take part in an EU-wide programme to co-ordinate the continent's response to the crisis. Government sources stressed that people would only be diverted to countries in Asia and Latin America if they were willing to be resettled there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department for International Development is expected to release a list of interested countries later. In Malta the Prime Minister insisted the focus of the &pound;30m programme was &quot;helping migrants return home rather than risk their lives continuing perilous journeys to Europe&quot;. It would provide assistance to refugees and migrants across Greece, the Balkans, Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priti Patel, the International Development Secretary, said: &quot;Conflict, drought and political upheaval have fuelled protracted crises and driven mass migration. We cannot ignore these challenges. &quot;This latest support from the UK will help those who decide they want to return home to do so safely, protect men, women and children from exploitation, and ensure that those caught in freezing conditions get the basic help they need to survive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The package will be delivered by UNHCR, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and NGO collective Start Network. Its aim is to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* provide 22,400 life-saving relief items including tents, blankets, winter clothes such as hats and gloves and hygiene kits including mother and baby products</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* help more than 60,000 people with emergency medical care, legal support and frontline workers to identify those at risk of violence and trafficking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* allow up to 22,000 people to reunite with family members they have become separated from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* help countries in Asia and Latin America that &quot;might be able to resettle refugees put the infrastructure and systems in place to do so&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* provide more than 1,500 refugees in Egypt, including those fleeing Syria and other conflicts, with urgent health assistance and educational grants for students to go back to school</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* provide a migrant centre in Sudan to enable &quot;voluntary returns home when safe&quot;, replicating a successful scheme in Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Government, the package will bring UK humanitarian support spending in response to the migrant crisis to more than &pound;100m since October 2015.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May has repeatedly refused to condemn Donald Trump's ban on refugees and entry for citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations during a meeting with Turkish leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime Minister held a joint press conference with Prime Minister Binali Y?ld?r?m just a day after meeting the new President in Washington. However, their talks were overshadowed by global debate over Mr Trump's executive order to ban Syrian refugees from entering the US indefinitely, halt all other asylum admissions for 120 days and suspend travel visas for citizens of &quot;countries of particular concern&quot;, including Syria, Iraq and other Muslim-majority nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faisal Islam, the political editor of Sky News, asked Ms May whether she viewed it as an &quot;action of the leader of the free world&quot;. The Prime Minister replied that she was &quot;very pleased&quot; to have met Mr Trump in Washington, before evading the question by hailing Turkey's reception of millions of refugees and Britain's support for its government and other nations surrounding Syria. When pressed for a second time for her view by another British journalist, Ms May continued: &quot;The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees, the United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom's policy on refugees.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yvette Cooper, the former shadow Home Secretary, sent a letter to the Prime Minister urging her to echo condemnation from French and German ministers over the &quot;deeply troubling&quot; executive order. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, said the Prime Minister's refusal to condemn Mr Trump's Muslim ban &quot;is shocking, wrong and cannot stand&quot;. He added: &quot;It flies in the face of the values of people across Britain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Y?ld?r?m was more direct, calling the crisis a global issue and saying that UN members &quot;cannot turn a blind eye to this issue and settle it by constructing walls... Nobody leaves their homes for nothing, they came here to save their lives and our doors were open???and we would do it again,&quot; he added. &quot;If there is someone in need, you need to give them a helping hand to make sure they survive.&quot; However, he brushed aside a question about wide-ranging human rights abuses in Turkey following the summer's attempted coup, seeing thousands of people arrested or forced to leave government and military posts amid reports of torture in state prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms May also evaded questions on her ally's alleged abuses in the press conference, but had earlier urged President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to &quot;sustain democracy by maintaining the rule of law and upholding its international human rights obligations&quot;. She said the pair also discussed counter-terrorism, security, trade and migration in talks which stretched for an hour longer than scheduled. Turkey has seen a succession of terror attacks by both Isis and Kurdish extremist groups since the start of the Syrian civil war, which caused millions of refugees to cross its border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US was among the countries resettling families from designated camps but Mr Trump has suspended all refugee admissions to the US for 120 days as part of measures he claimed would &quot;keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US&quot;. His order additionally banned Syrian refugees indefinitely until &quot;significant changes&quot; are made, and halved the annual cap on refugees to 50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President's executive order also suspends travel visas for anyone from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Syria, Iraq, Libya and Iran, from entering the US for at least 90 days. He claimed his administration needed time to develop more stringent screening processes for refugees, immigrants and visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It provoked outcry from the United Nations and NGOs working to stem the worst ever global refugee crisis, with more than 65 million people forced to flee their homes. Amnesty International warned the move could have &quot;catastrophic consequences&quot;, saying some of the worst fears about a Trump presidency were already being realised. Salil Shetty, the group's secretary general, said: &quot;These men, women and children are the victims of the same terror President Trump claims he wants to fight against. The irony beggars belief.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A HUNT is underway for a Syrian scientist posing as a refugee and plotting a chemical attack on a British seaside town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intelligence agencies are hunting for a Syrian scientist posing as a refugee&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan was uncovered by German police who stumbled across documents as they searched a refugee camp for the Berlin truck killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These detailed chemical agents and the names of British towns. But the suspect, aged in his early 30s, had disappeared and it is feared he could now be in the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources say he was trained in toxins by the Assad regime and was being tracked by US agents before giving them the slip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Dozens dead after fuel truck explodes in busy town near Turkish border  'ISIS will strike Italy soon' Warning as officers do shooting practice </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news emerges just days after security minister Ben Wallace warned Britain to prepare for a &quot;mass casualty attack&quot; which may involve chemical weapons. Last week, Britain's most senior fire chief warned that the potential for a terrorist chemical attack in the country is a &quot;huge concern&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alarm was raised on December 20, when counter-terror police raided Berlin's defunct Tempelhof airport, now the site of the country's largest refugee camp, following the Berlin terror attack on the previous day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As more than 250 officers ransacked the camp in their search for the attacker, they discovered a document with details about a separate plot in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan was discovered by German police while searching for the Berlin truck killer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, which was partially charred, contained details of chemical agent and listed two English towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The contents were of such significance that MI5 were immediately contacted,&quot; said an intelligence source last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security services were last night scouring both targets, one of which was described only as &quot;a seaside on town on the south coast&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Intelligence sources confirmed they had already been warned by US counterparts about the possibility of a Syrian scientist posing as a refugee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German police immoediately informed MI5 of the plot due to the seriousness of the discovery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US spies had been tracking the suspect, trained under the Assad regime, after he left Damascus. However, the trail went cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the camp discovery showed he had travelled further into Europe than had been previously thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night officials with Germany's Ministry of the Interior said: &quot;We can neither comment on ongoing investigations nor on the details of our intelligence services' operations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientist is thought to have been trained by the Assad regime. He is said to have played a key role in chemical attacks launched by President Bashar Assad on his own people.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed that he has either gone rogue and is now working for fundamentalist groups against Assad - or that he is part of a 'false flag' operation arranged by the dictator so that a terror outrage can be blamed on Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientist is not thought to have any covert training, fuelling the belief that he is arranging to meet sympathisers already here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our US counterparts have been instrumental in tracking this individual. I can say that the net in closing in,&quot; added the source.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is feared that his chemical expertise goes far beyond the homemade Chlorine-based mustard gas used by IS in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2013 Coalition forces destroyed 600 tonnes of chemical agents used by Assad to manufacture Sarin and mustard gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sanctioned the use of Sarin in 2013 during an attack against opposition forces in Ghouta, Death toll estimates range from 281 - 1,791 civilians.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibility that his actions are being directly sponsored by the Assad regime, with the intention of showing that IS has access to very sophisticated chemical agents, is &quot;very real&quot;, analysts warned last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is certainly possible that this scientist's actions could be directed by the regime,&quot; said Kyle W Orton, Research Fellow and Syria analyst with the Henry Jackson Society think-tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the very beginning, Assad's aim has been to enlist the West as at least a tacit partner by transforming the conflict into a binary one between himself and Islamist terrorists, and he has worked to empower jihadists, including IS, to achieve this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Intelligence services revealed that they had been warned of the Syrian scientist by the US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Assad has been largely successful in diverting Western attention away from his own position toward a narrow counter-terrorism focus. He believes, - erroneously - that he can be thought of as part of the solution. A successful attack on British soil blamed on IS would reinforce this position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The targeting of two English towns could show an understandable reluctance to avoid the Capital's sophisticated face-recognition CCTV network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People think that London is the only target, but it isn't. Provincial towns are a must easier and more effective target, - and all the expertise for this type of attack is in London, so attacking a town outside the capital would carry a greater chance of success&quot; added Col Hamish de Bretton-Gordon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just imagine the effect of an attack in Westquay, in Southampton, with 50,000 shoppers, a football stadium or even a busy commuter train. A department store with a couple of hundred people would be just as effective.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE woman spends her days looking for pennies on the street to help her survive. Another has become so paranoid she goes hungry because she fears she will be poisoned at her local foodbank. Some have ended up in psychiatric wards, or made suicide attempts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to the fallout of the UK asylum system, which NHS doctors claim is making already traumatised refugees mentally ill. The British Red Cross claims it is now seeing destitute refugees who are feeling suicidal on an almost daily basis. Other leading charities claim the system is designed to &quot;break&quot; people. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In testimony provided last week to the Scottish Parliament's inquiry into destitution, asylum and insecure immigration status, doctors from NHS Glasgow Psychological Trauma Service claim policies that make refugees destitute is re-traumatising them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinical psychologists claim their clients are experiencing chronic anxiety, clinical depression, flashbacks and even psychosis as a direct result of their asylum support being stopped. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees can find themselves destitute, homeless and with no access to public funds (NRPF) at various stages of the asylum process, including when their case has been refused. The Home Office claims this ensures refused refugees return to their home countries. But campaigners say the policy is both inhumane and ineffective. In their evidence to the inquiry, trauma service doctors said destitute clients were more likely to experience mental health crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One client refuses to go to a foodbank believing she will be poisoned because she is a black asylum seeker,&quot; the evidence notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the level of destitution of refugees, psychologists said that rather than being able to offer therapy they were instead spending time making applications for emergency grants. Rachel Morley, consultant clinical psychologist for the service, told the Sunday Herald it was essential that traumatised people got appropriate support. &quot;Destitution makes people profoundly unsafe,&quot; she said. &quot;It can make people unwell. It can worsen PTSD, make people more depressed, and suicidal. Destitution also makes people vulnerable to still more trauma, more violence, more sexual exploitation.&quot; One client told her: &quot;Girls are raped or sleep with men because they need a place to live.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors are now calling for Scottish Government support for an advocacy service to work with victims of trauma. One client whose case has been refused said his experiences of the asylum system have caused flashbacks of torture and detention in his home country. &quot;My sessions [with the psychological service] did help a little but they cannot stop the sadness because the problems continue,&quot; he told the Sunday Herald. &quot;I worry all the time. I feel I haven't got anything positive in my life. Sometimes I feel like my life is finished. The system is making us ill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Red Cross said the number of destitute refugees and asylum seekers it helped in Glasgow had increased from 326 in 2014 to 820 in 2016. Phil Arnold, head of refugee support, added: &quot;Our clients tell us that relying on friends, who are often struggling themselves, for a sofa to sleep on or food to eat, is extremely difficult. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've seen an increase in the number of clients thinking about suicide. It's an almost daily occurrence at the moment and we've had to ensure that all of our staff are now trained in suicide prevention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robina Qureshi, director of refugee charity Positive Action in Housing, which gave out &pound;45,000 in destitution grants last year, said the system left people hopeless and despairing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see healthy, strong people who have escaped gang rape, or seen family members shot in front of them, who come to the UK because they see it as a beacon of hope, somewhere they will find protection. Instead they are oppressed by a system that is ultimately designed to break human beings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Qureshi, whose organisation runs the Room for Refugees hosting scheme, claimed finding somewhere secure to stay can be life-changing. &quot;They can start to rebuild their strength, re-engage with lawyers and integrate into society,&quot; she added. &quot;The charity has found thousands of people accommodation and though it cannot offer rooms for people with severe mental health problems, it tries to identify empty flats or other solutions.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamid Mohammadi, 38, who fled Iran due to political problems, has been destitute for seven years but was saved from homelessness by the hosting scheme. Now volunteering for a Glasgow hospital, he claimed having a roof over his head made a huge difference. Yet his situation can make him depressed and anxious. &quot;Often I can't sleep and everything is very stressful,&quot; he said. &quot;Twice when I have not been sleeping I have got up suddenly convinced that someone is coming to arrest me and take me back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christina McKelvie MSP, convener of the Equalities and Human Rights Committee, said: &quot;The evidence is stark. In the words of our witnesses, destitution leaves people without a life and just an existence, and is built in to the UK asylum process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said those who had been refused asylum were expected to leave the UK and were given support when going through the process if they could prove they would otherwise be destitute. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten&nbsp;Tory MPs are backing a change to the Children and Social Work Bill - and another 13 could sign up -&nbsp;to require ministers to publish vacancy numbers among local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Ministers faced a storm of criticism  earlier this year after announcing that the programme would close after 350 lone youngsters are brought to Britain from Europe.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Home Office was not tied to resettling a specific number under the Dubs Amendment, the figure was well below the 3,000 charities and politicians originally called for the UK to accept.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MPs who have signed to the motion include the former ministers Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Tim Loughton as well as Heidi Allen, David Burrowes and David Warburton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government had closed the Dubs scheme after it had accepted only about a tenth of the target they had committed to, claiming that there were no more places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Alf Dubs speaks to two refugees from SyriaCredit:      Rob Stothard/Getty     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the home affairs select committee published on Monday found that councils were saying they had space for more refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said ministers were too hasty in closing&nbsp;the programme because local authorities had capacity for thousands more and urged them consult urgently with Kevin Hyland, the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner,&nbsp; to see if councils can provide further places for unaccompanied children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hyland had told them that &quot;there may in fact be greater local authority capacity&quot; for child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian migrant children Nor, Saleh and Hajaj Fatema in Marsta, SwedenCredit:      Jessica Gow     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Allen, who tabled the amendment, told the Telegraph: &quot;This amendment is about taking up the generous offer of many local authorities across the country who have said they have the capacity to take in these children.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The refugee crisis does not stop at the end of the financial year and nor&nbsp;can our offer to help.&nbsp;If children don't have safe and legal routes they will turn to the hands of the traffickers.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Cowan, leader of the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, also told the MPs that there is &quot;certainly extra capacity&quot; in councils &quot;across London&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shadow education secretary Angela RaynerCredit:      PA     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Rayner, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: &quot;The government has already been forced into a humiliating climb down on their dangerous plans to weaken protections for vulnerable children this week.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we want to make sure they keep their promises to refugee children as well. With dozens of their own MPs ready to join the opposition on this, they need to listen before it's too late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour MP Alison McGovern added: &quot;Given the overwhelming support for the Dubs refugee children, and the public's disgust at the Government slamming the door shut, it is vital that Theresa May listens to Tory rebels and re-opens the scheme. We will keep bringing this back to the Commons until she does so.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Donald Trump's ban on refugees entering Americahas caused chaos, confusion and anger across the globe, as people were turned back from US-bound flights and others were detained on arrival at American airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 12 people were being held at New York's JFK Airport, two of them Iraqis who had worked for the US in Iraq and had been targeted for doing so. As lawyers filed a lawsuit demanding their release, passengers at various airports, including places such as Cairo, were turned back. KLM announced it had refused carriage to the US to seven passengers from predominately Muslim countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump denied that his executiveorder amount to a Muslim ban, but he said: &quot;This is working out very nicely.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Mr Trump signed a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travellers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries. He claimed the moves would protect Americans from terrorism. &quot;We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,&quot; he said in a ceremony at the Pentagon, where he also signed an order to boost the US military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enforcement of the order sparked outcry, not just in the US, but around the world, where travellers to the US were immediately confronted with uncertainty and doubt. Mr Trump had spoken during the election campaign of his intention to heighten screening of refugees, but refugees from the seven countries affected already face intense vetting that can last up to five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a stupid, terrible decision which will hurt the American people more than us or anybody else, because it shows that this President can't manage people, politics or global relationships,&quot; Najeed Haidari, a Yemeni-American security manager for an oil company in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, told Reuters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May refuses to condemn Muslim ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Betsy Fisher of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said of the ban: &quot;[This] announcement is a betrayal of the fundamentally American value of welcoming those who are fleeing persecution. The US refugee programme is essential to US foreign relations and national security. Abandoning refugees means abandoning American humanitarian leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mana Yegani, an immigration lawyer in Houston, who works with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said Customs and Border Patrol agents at many airports were unaware of the executive order early on Friday evening. She said she had spent the night fielding calls from travellers with student and worker visas who were being denied entry to the US.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are people that are coming in legally. They have jobs here and they have vehicles here,&quot; she told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the two Iraqis held in New York, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, had worked on behalf of the US government in Iraq for 10 years. The other man, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, had flown to the US to join his wife, who had worked for a US contractor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Darweeh was eventually released after the intervention of local politicians and lawyers. Mr Darweesh thanked the people who had worked to set him free.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 226 asylum seekers have lost their lives attempting to reach Europe so far this year - more than double the figure for the same period in 2016 - and many more remain at risk as rough seas and the extreme cold continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greek border police had to dig through more than a metre of snow to find the body of one man who died after crossing over the River Evros near the Turkish border - one of several asylum seekers to be killed by sub-zero temperatures in recent weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 500 refugees rescued in single day as crisis continues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees freezing to death in extreme conditions across Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials found two suspected smugglers nearby with seven other asylum seekers, including one who was still wearing wet clothes and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were discovered near Feres, where the land border between Turkey and Greece is being used by migrants diverted from crossing the Aegean Sea by the controversial EU-Turkey deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It followed the deaths of two Iraqi men and a Somaliwoman in snow-covered Bulgarian mountains, and another Afghan man in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said refugees had also been killed by hypothermia while in flimsy dinghies launched from North Africa towards Italy, with three bodies found inside a boat rescued and taken to Lampedusa at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, at least 180 migrants drowned when their vessel capsized in rough seas around 30 miles from the Libyan coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death toll was originally believed to stand at around 105 but interviews with survivors have revealed that the boat was larger and more crowded than initially thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a handful or survivors were found in search operations by ships including Italian Navy vessels, which recovered the bodies of eight migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the circumstances of the shipwreck will be further explained when the survivors are brought ashore, it seems likely that this incident resulted in the death of over 100 people,&quot; said Federico Soda, from the IOM in Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We still do not know the nationalities or if there were women or children on board. It is a tragic start to the new year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,100 rescued people, mostly from Western Africa, were taken ashore on the Italian islands of Lampedusa and Sicily on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee crisis: More than 500 migrants rescued in single day in Mediterranean Sea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivors told IOM workers they attempted the sea crossing to flee violence and abuses in Libya, feeling they had no option but to put themselves in the hands of smugglers who forced them onto boats in treacherous sea conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people have told us that when they get to the beach, those who change their mind and don't want to go are forced to get on board, sometimes with violence,&quot; said Ms Soda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 25 more refugees are believed to have drowned attempting to cross from Morocco to Spain, with several bodies washing up over the weekend. Two women and a baby are among those reported missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just over 3,000 asylum seekers, mostly from Syria, Afghanistan and Nigeria, have entered Europe so far this year according to UN figures, compared to more than 73,000 in July 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But death rates have been rocketing since the Central Mediterranean became the main route following attempts to stop comparatively shorter and safer crossings over the Aegean Sea by detaining anyone arriving on Greek islands under threats of deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of migrants are still being held in makeshift tent camps, with several being covered in snow, sparking emergency measures from Greek authorities aiming to find safer accommodation in empty hotels or on a navy ship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many more are stranded by closed borders and security crackdowns across Europe, sleeping in makeshift shelters or on the streets in cities including the Serbian capital of Belgrade, where temperatures have reached -20C.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rescue workers warn that people will continue to arrive as the crisis shows no sign of slowing in the Central Mediterranean, which has become the deadliest sea crossing in the world since the start of the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 550 refugees were rescued on Friday alone off the coast of Libya, where continuing conflict and lawlessness since the British-backed defeat of Muammar Gaddafi has allowed the smuggling and exploitation of migrants to thrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories of the refugees rescued from the Mediterranean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 5,000 refugees were drowned, suffocated or crushed while attempting to cross the Mediterranean and Aegean seas in 2016, making it the deadliest year on record - a tragic benchmark 2017 is already on course to beat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Unravelling the Mediterranean Migration Crisis (Medmig) project partly blamed Britain and EU nations for spiralling death rates, concluding that the refusal to open up legal routes for those seeking safety in Europe has increased demand for people smuggling on ever more dangerous routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operations to combat the thriving trade have driven the use of smaller and less seaworthy boats, which are harder to spot by ships patrolling as part of the EU's Operation Sophia and authorities in north Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poorly made dinghies are now being loaded with more than 150 people a time, creating the risk of sinkings, capsizings or the inflatable bursting under the strain, as well as deadly fuel spills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 3,000 migrants and refugees have arrived by sea in Europe so far this year. The vast majority of those arriving in Italy are African, from countries including Nigeria, Eritrea and Guinea, while most of the much lower number of asylum seekers reaching Greek islands are dominantly Syrian, Afghan or Iraqi.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS charity Christian Aid steps up its efforts to help refugees Tim Hughes speaks to refugee camp families in Serbia who fled their homes to escape fighting and the extremists of Islamic State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOGR Karem is proud of his family, and beckons them over to practice their English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impossibly cute, Mansur, ten, Noor, six, and Nial, three, jump on a bed, giggle shyly, hold their hands up to their faces and smile through their fingers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hogr is a professional man, from northern Iraq and tells me life was very good - until the day Islamic State came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Daesh are very bad,&quot; he says, using the name given to the extremists by those forced to witness their brutality in Iraq and Syria. &quot;We had no choice but to leave.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the help of his wife Shadeya Fatah, who looks on sadly, he pours fragrant sweet tea, and I sit and hear how this lovely family's life has changed forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not in his house, however, but in a curtained-off corner of a former tobacco factory in the deep south of Serbia, hard up against the disputed border with Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tiny unit, with bunk bed, two chairs and a table, in a dusty forgotten corner of the Balkans, is home for Hogr and his family, after they made the treacherous journey from their home, hoping for a new life in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tells me how the family trekked across Kurdistan and into Turkey, of the terrifying journey in a leaky boat across the Mediterranean to Greece, and the brutal reception they received in Bulgaria, where he says he was beaten by rogue police officers and forced to give them more than 2,000 Euros - most of their savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They crossed into Macedonia, then Serbia - and stayed. This, they say, is where the trail ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union has closed its borders to people like Hogr and Shadeya and their children - they don't want them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hungarian and Croatian frontiers are heavily policed, and anyone found attempting to cross is sent back. Young men talk of having dogs set on to them, suffering terrible injuries. Fortress Europe is shut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just want a safe home for our children,&quot; says Hogr. His smile slips and Shadeya begins to cry, hiding her face. &quot;We are nervous about our future,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a story repeated again and again by families in the Presevo refugee camp and at the 16 others like it across Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the tales of anguish are harrowing, at least the refugees are being looked after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While neighbouring countries have slammed the door shut, and corrupt officials and criminals along the torturous route have made their lives a misery, the Serbians are offering sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the forefront of the aid effort here is Christian Aid - which has been on the side of refugees since 1945, when it was set up to support those made homeless and forced onto the move by the Second World War. The parallels with what is happening today are clear to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2015 the charity has worked with its partner organisation, Philanthropy - the charitable arm of the Serbian Orthodox Church - as part of the Refugee Crisis Appeal. Its work is vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without help, people like Hogr, Shadeya and thousands like them would be homeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are estimates of up to 3,000 illegal migrants in Serbia, itself struggling to get back on its feet after years of conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The Serbians know what it's like to be a refugee. The implosion of their own country saw streams of people seeking safety away from the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are all refugees here,&quot; says Dragan Makojevic, Director of Philanthropy, speaking to me from the simple suburban house which serves as the charity's base in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandfather, my father - everyone was a refugee. This is our story and it would be shameful not to help these people now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the beginning we were a bit scared by the numbers of young men coming through, but then their families came and we had to help them. And any problems caused by the refugees are insignificant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been a humbling experience and you learn a lot. People are running away from terrible things and are following their dreams. Many have been victims of brutality and trafficking, but once they get here they are safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Helping these people starts to make you believe I humanity again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the camps they get safe shelter, are fed, receive language classes (German is popular), get medical attention and legal advice on what to do next. There are school classes for the children. Young men let off steam on a volleyball pitch and play football and cricket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a shocking view of what happens without the help of organisations like Christian Aid, you need look no further than the centre of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately behind the city's ornate railway station, hundreds of people - most from Afghanistan and dangerous parts of Pakistan - &not; are sheltering in horrendous conditions in rows of former freight sheds and engine works. It's a squalid scene, unsanitary, muddy, infested with rats and with refugees forced to burn rubbish - including plastic, polystyrene and railway sleepers covered in tar to keep warm, it's dangerous and unhealthy. Many suffer respiratory problems. They rely on food hand outs from well-wishers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philanthropy is keen to help the squatters move into safe camps but traumatised by their experiences, the refugees are terrified of being registered, imprisoned or, worse, sent back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the refugees pouring into Serbia have come via Turkey, paying smugglers to sail them across the Aegean Sea to Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Packed into overcrowded, unseaworthy boats and inflatables, the hazards of the journey are well known. Everyone has seen the heartbreaking image of the Syrian child, washed up on a Turkish beach after the boat in which he was travelling capsized. Most deaths, however, go unreported, similarly the everyday tales of brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A typical story is that of Muhamed Adnan Khan, 24, from the Afghan- Pakistan border, who I met in Presevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhamed was a professional footballer, playing for police and army teams, and briefly, for the Pakistan national side, but was forced to leave when he began getting threats from the Taliban, who run swathes of the country's lawless north west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was in danger of my life,&quot; he says. &quot;My father was in the Taliban but fell out with the others and was killed. &quot;The rules are one member of the family must join the Taliban or pay. We were a rich family so my mother gave money for my older brothers and tried to pay them off so I wouldn't have to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said 'we need him educated' but they said if I don't go they would kill me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journey was horrific. He says he was treated like an animal - at one point forced into a small vehicle with 35 people. The police, he said, were as bad as the thieves who would beat and rob them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He now hopes to seek asylum in Serbia and play football for a local side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zabilah Muradi's journey was worse than most. An electrician from the dangerous Taliban-plagues Swat valley of Pakistani Kashmir, has epilepsy and suffered multiple seizures - which got worse after he was beaten by corrupt police officers, he says, in Albania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every day I would faint,&quot; he says. He looks forlorn. &quot;I have always had this but after I was beaten it increased these problems and I often go unconscious. I don't feel good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I meet Zabilah as he collected a cash card, in a scheme backed by Christian Aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very good for me,&quot; he smiles. &quot;It means I can buy juice to help me take my medicine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a tiny luxury, but one which means a lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am grateful,&quot; he says. &quot;We want to work and look after our families, but at the moment we can't. No one else is helping us and we are very grateful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">60 YEARS OF SUPPORT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian Aid has been marking 60 years of Christian Aid Week and the organisation is inviting people to join it in standing in solidarity with refugees around the world. And that effort continues. The charity has been working with refugees since the Second World War, and is not turning its back now.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urgent action is needed to help at least 23,000 unaccompanied child refugees stranded in squalid and unsafe Greek and Italian refugee camps, an official EU audit has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camp life in Greek and Italian &quot;hotspots&quot; - holding centres set up at migrant arrival points - is plagued by a lack of security safeguards, water, decent food, blankets and medical facilities, the new study says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claude Moraes, the chair of the European parliament's justice and home affairs committee, described the report as &quot;an alarm bell being rung&quot; about the failures of EU states. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amount of child abuse, rape and smuggling that is going on is horrific,&quot; he said. &quot;If the EU is to have any sort of value it has to care for unaccompanied minors when they arrive in Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Reports indicate widespread child sexual exploitation in the centres, which Pope Francis compared to &quot;concentration camps&quot; over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many unaccompanied minors have been held for long periods at the hotspots in inappropriate conditions, despite the law requiring that they be prioritised,&quot; says the report by the EU's Court of Auditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The [European] commission should insist on the appointment of a child protection officer for every hotspot/site,&quot; it adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU states committed to rehousing 34,953 migrants from Italian camps but, by last September, had only made 3,809 formal &quot;pledges&quot; to do so and less than 1,200 actual relocations, according to the auditors. None were unaccompanied minors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catherine Woollard, the secretary general of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, said that the EU's treatment of lone children was &quot;one of the most shameful aspects of the refugee crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This report adds to a large volume of evidence about the exploitation and maltreatment that highly vulnerable unaccompanied minors are suffering,&quot; she said. &quot;Getting them to safety is now vital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the EU's hotspots approach improved the fingerprinting and security vetting of migrants, the auditors said that funding and relocation &quot;bottlenecks&quot; had extended the detention of migrants, with disastrous consequences for children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many slept rough or in unsegregated adult facilities with little security, surrounded by the constant threat of violence. On the Greek island of Chios, EU staff themselves had to be evacuated because of riots and aggression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hans Gustaf Wessberg, the study's lead author, said that the accommodating and processing of unaccompanied infants in the hotspots fell short of international standards and needed &quot;to be addressed as a matter of urgency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children often travel alone to the camps from war zones in Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq, because their parents can only afford to pay for one family member to leave. But minors are also targeted by smugglers in the sex trade, according to Europol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Uganda at breaking point as Bidi Bidi becomes world's largest refugee camp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law enforcement agency's briefings suggest that a new surge in the number of refugees and migrants trying to reach Europe could begin as soon as June. More than 5,000 people lost their lives in the Mediterranean in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are about to see another wave in the crisis,&quot; Moraes said. &quot;It is partly seasonal and partly because of even more problems in Libya, the final movements of people from Syria, and because Turkey is creating pressure again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost 90% of the 2,500 child migrants in Greek hotspots come from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. In the Italian camps, at least 20,500 children are predominantly from African nations affected by conflict and persecution, such as Nigeria and Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, only five children are thought to have been relocated to the UK from the hotspots under family reunion rules in the Dublin regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is appalling that the UK did not sign up to the Dubs scheme,&quot; Moraes said. &quot;The UK showed a lack of leadership and solidarity in a refugee crisis that will affect both Europe and the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The Iranian cartoonist known as Eaten Fish has broken a weeks-long hunger strike he held to protest against the handling of his claims of abuse while in immigration detention on Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eaten Fish posted on Facebook on Saturday afternoon that he would end the protest, which was into its 19 th day and left him &quot;already 46 [kg] and close to [losing] my body parts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The asylum seeker went on hunger strike after immigration authorities told him last month his complaints of sexual assault and abuse in detention were not substantiated and he would be returned to the main centre compound to live among the alleged perpetrators.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Happy Bloody Christmas: The True Story of Faysal, by Eaten Fish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Eaten Fish wrote on Saturday: &quot;I'm going to start eating just now and end the protest... I wanted to protest and keep doing it but hunger strike is turning to some thing else which I don't want it to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cartoonist, whose chronicling of life in detention last year won him Cartoonist Rights Network International's award for courage in editorial cartooning, said he was being plagued by thoughts of ending his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm scared that I kill myself by my hand before hunger strike kills me. I did protest because I need safety... Protection... I don't want to die,&quot; he wrote on Facebook. &quot;I do not want to be made to suffer anymore. I need help and I need safety and I need proper treatment. I need safety and peace more than food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian Australia cartoonist First Dog on the Moon, also known as Andrew Marlton, said Eaten Fish told him on Sunday of a slight improvement in his condition after eating twice, including some noodles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Dog, who has mentored the young Iranian and spoken daily with him for several years, said he was &quot;mentally hugely unwell but also incredibly strong, mentally&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, you have to be to go on a hunger strike,&quot; he said. &quot;But his body is falling apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behrouz Boochani, the Iranian journalist also living in Manus Island detention centre, shared Eaten Fish's post via Facebook on Saturday, writing: &quot;I'm sorry that I have to put these words. This man needs medical treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eaten Fish is among about 900 men in the Manus Island centre, which has been slated for closure by the end of 2017 after the Papua New Guinea high court last year ruled it &quot;illegal and unconstitutional&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iranian, after four years on Manus Island, is also among 60 men issued with a forced deportation order after being denied refugee status before the centre's slated closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half of 168 Manus detainees who have been denied refugee status are from Iran, a country that refuses to accept the forced return of its citizens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eaten Fish has been unable to complete interviews to determine his refugee status because of his post-traumatic illness and panic attacks triggered by questions about his experience in Iran, trauma worker Janet Galbraith has told Fairfax media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His and others' future hopes may hinge on completing the refugee determination process and applying for resettlement in the United States.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resettlement support centre, contracted by the US state department, has begun preliminary interviews for refugees on Manus Island. Security vetting interviews by the US Department of Homeland Security would follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has declined a standing offer from New Zealand to accept 150 refugees from Australia's offshore detention centres in favour of pursuing a deal for the US to consider taking up to 1250 refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is despite the agreement, brokered by the former Obama administration, not binding the US to accepting a single refugee and the US president, Donald Trump, describing it as a &quot;dumb deal&quot; and the &quot;worst deal ever&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday, Turnbull met with his NZ counterpart, Bill English, who said the offer to take 150 refugees still stood but &quot;so far, they haven't taken it up&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull said he appreciated the offer but Australia would pursue the deal struck with the Obama administration for the US to take up to 1250 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This offer from NZ has been available for some time and it is one that we appreciate but our focus is on completing the arrangements with the United States,&quot; Turnbull said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacob Vieira's roll neck top does not obscure the pronounced scarring to his neck and it soon emerges that his forearms are equally disfigured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the consequence, he says, of him avoiding what the drug gangs can demand of elite young footballers in the capital of his native Kenya: ferry narcotics across the border on the team coach when they're playing in neighbouring Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vieira gave the dealer who approached him in Nairobi the slip by providing a wrong departure date for the Kenyan national youth team's trip out the country. A few weeks later, the player arrived at his ownfront door and discovered, on trying to open it, that it had been rigged up to a high voltage electrical current. He was electrocuted, rendered unconscious and much of the skin on his face was burned off.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in this state that he arrived for a pre-appointed trial with Newcastle United in August 2014. So startled were the coaches at the club's Academy after hearing his story that they urged him seek asylum here. Two and a half years later and now 21, Vieira is still trying to convince the British authorities that a return home risks more serious injury. An individual within the British asylum appeal system is not permitted to work or study, though, so all hope of joining Newcastle, or any other side, has been put on hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office says it refuses to discuss individual cases but Vieira seems to have been treated with the suspicion which pervades many western countries where those seeking asylum are concerned. He says the Home Office have told him to demonstrate he is high profile enough to be at risk if he returns. Since he played for Kenyan Premier League side Muhoroni Youth FC before Newcastle paid for his flight to Britain, he thought that newspaper cuttings would be enough. Not so. He is still mired in the appeal system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everton's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coaching sessions for refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere in the midst of this on-going struggle did Jacob, who is now 21, think he would form a deep attachment to a Premier League football club. But after being held in the Harmondsworth Detention Centre in west London, he happened to be dispersed to the city of Liverpool while his case for asylum was considered. It is there he has come into contact with Everton, the club who have arguably done more than any in Britain to provide sanctuary and activity for refugees and asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club's weekly coaching session for them, run by Everton in the Community in the local Kensington district, has helped more than 250 people from around 25 countries - predominantly those worst affected by conflict in the Middle East. A total of 59 Sudanese, 10 Iraqis, 19 Ethiopians and 74 Eritreans have been welcomed through the club's doors and they have not been the only beneficiaries. Local young players have been keen to play matches against them, helping remove potential race-related suspicion. &quot;It helps remove suspicions and the 'I don't want you here. You're the refugees' mindset,&quot; says Lee Johnson, the Everton in the Community support worker who has done much to make this project, funded by Liverpool City Council, a success. Vieira's initial contact with the club came when a local scout saw him and recommended him to the club as a trialist.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems a supreme example of football's potential to celebrate refugee footballers, which Amnesty International is highlighting this weekend with the 80th anniversary of the arrival of Spanish Civil War child refugees to the UK who later went on to become professional footballers here. Everton are one of more than 20 clubs - also including Leicester City, Hull City, Southampton, Brentford and Notts County - to show their solidarity and support for refugees on Amnesty's Football Welcomes weekend. Both Leicester and Hull are organising a game for refugees participating in its community scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the release from the isolation of the asylum seeker's no-man's-land which seems to have been the biggest help for Vieira. &quot;I'm not allowed to work or go to college and I'm only allowed to play football for local amateur teams,&quot; he says. &quot;You can feel isolated and on the outside.&quot; The project has allowed him to work on a Level 1 coaching badge while in this state of limbo, as well as study mental health and work on the Premier League's 'employability' qualification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You feel that people don't want to believe anything you say when you are in this process,&quot; he says. &quot;I provided all of the evidence of why I arrived so scarred. I'd never thought of this asylum thing until the coaches I first met saw how I felt about going back and suggested it. Everton have been willing to give me a place to be and see me as an individual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Everton project's students was given a trial at Nottingham Forest after he had been granted leave to remain here and Vieira, who describes himself as a utility player, struck up a strong rapport with the former Everton manager Roberto Martinez, when he visited the weekly coaching session in 2015. &quot;I've trained with Tom Davies at the Academy and you could see that he's special,&quot; Vieira says. &quot;I want to prove to a club that I am too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump on Saturday defended his tough new immigration bans, which prompted outrage as migrants were barred from entering the United States, including families of refugees, legal permanent residents and Ivy League students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president denied that his executive order, which bars refugees and citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US, was a Muslim ban.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He maintained that the ban was 'working very nicely' while chaos broke out in airports as migrants were stopped and some non-American citizens realized they were now barred from the country where they were studying or had lived, perhaps for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's comments came as seven refugees bound for the US were stopped from boarding a plane in Cairo on Saturday and 12 migrants were detained in New York overnight because they arrived just after the executive order was signed, prompting a massive protest and a cab strike. Additional reports of dozens of people being stopped from entering the US or booted off airplanes have been pouring in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's not a Muslim ban, but we are totally prepared,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Saturday afternoon, according to The Hill.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's working out very nicely. You see it in the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely and we are going to have a very, very strict ban and we are going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panic broke out after Department of Homeland Security issued a directive at 4:30 pm on Friday enforcing Trump's executive order to close down the borders to refugees and visa holders from a list of banned Muslim-majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Iran, the other countries on Trump's blacklist are Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of people being detained were coming from all around the United States on Saturday. 'They're literally pouring in by the minute,'&nbsp;director of the International Refugee Assistance Project&nbsp;Becca Heller told the New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 50 people were held at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, USA Today &nbsp;reported. Fifty people were also detained at Dulles International Airport, where protesters gathered. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and Attorney General Mark Herring have said the state could take legal action against the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Yale student said he would be unable to attend the prestigious Ivy League university. Another student from the Massachusetts Institute Of Technology said he was barred from boarding a plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Stanford University student, a Sudanese national and legal permanent resident with a green card, was held for eight hours at JFK before being able to return to California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian scientist was meant to fly to Boston to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard but has now had his visa suspended indefinitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,' Professor Thomas Michel, who was going to supervise the student, told The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two families of six from Syria were affected. One was supposed to relocate to Cleveland, Ohio, after having to flee their home in 2014. But their trip has now been canceled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another family of six from the war-torn country was detained at Philadelphia International Airport Saturday morning even though they had required legal documents and approved green cards and visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plane passengers were turned away in Dubai and Istanbul, including at least one family who got ejected from a flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four legal permanent residents with green cards coming home to Atlanta from Iran were detained, an attorney told WSBTV reporter Matt Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout from Trump's immigration crackdown grew on Saturday.&nbsp;The visa ban sparked fear for some refugees who were already on their way to the US when the order came into effect and were detained on arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear how many refugees or visa holders are already being detained across the country. Twelve refugees were held in New York City's JFK on Friday night. Cabs at the airport went on strike for an hour from 6 pm to 7 pm to protest against the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqi refugees who was detained for 14 hours at New York, was released on Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 53-year-old had arrived in America on a flight from Istanbul on Friday night, just hours after Trump implemented the immigration ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He&nbsp;had worked for the US government in Iraq for 10 years as a translator, engineer and contractor and had a valid special immigration visa to relocate to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darweesh pumped his fist in the air outside the airport following his release, as a crowd of supporters cheered him on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'First of all I want to thank the people that take care of me and support me. This is the humility, this is the soul of America,' he told a crowd gathered outside the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is what pushed me to move - leave my country and come here. America is the land of freedom... America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what he thought of Trump he said: 'I don't know. He's a president, I'm a normal person.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was travelling with his wife and three children at the time but they were not detained. They were heading to Charlotte, North Carolina to start their new life in America.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Darweesh and another Iraqi Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who is still detained at JFK, filed a lawsuit on Saturday morning in a bid to have them released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men were on separate flights when immigration officials stopped them on Friday night and took their passports when they landed in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alshawi - who was approved for a visa on January 11 - was flying to America to join his wife and son in Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHO EXACTLY IS BANNED FROM THE U.S?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That covers legal permanent residents - green card holders - and visa-holders from those seven countries who were out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban.&nbsp;They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customs and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas have been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S. Airlines are being told to keep them off those flights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven other refugees are still being held at JFK airport. Protesters gathered outside the airport on Saturday in anger over those being held in detention.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cairo airport officials said seven US-bound migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's JFK airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the UN refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane on Saturday after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action at Cairo airport was the first there since Trump imposed the three-month ban on refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutch airline KLM says it had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world - that these people are no longer welcome,' Manel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the seven, who were from the seven blacklisted countries, were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee said there was chaos at airports and in the air following Trump's ban with the organization already receiving calls for help from green card and other visa holders after being refused admission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Visas being denied immediately. Chaos at airports and in the air. #MuslimBan will apply to green card holders attempting to return tonight,' the ADC's Abed Ayoub tweeted on Friday night.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's ban puts a 90-day pause on visas and immigration from seven countries including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also puts a 120-day ban on all refugee entries into the country and declares that refugees from Syria are not welcome until further notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that period of time, refugees will be accepted only from countries that the State and Homeland Security Departments decide are safe to work with.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran's foreign ministry suggested the country would limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for Trump's suspension of immigration and visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ANTI-IMMIGRATION ORDER DO?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban refugee entries from all countries for 120 days. Refugees can be accepted on case-by-case basis, including&nbsp;if they are a religious minority facing religious persecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Block refugee entries from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap refugee intake at 50,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban visa and immigration entries for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries on banned list, including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspend visa issuance to countries of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official IRNA news agency carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry on Saturday that said Iran will resort to 'counteraction' to Trump's executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals,' the statement read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google urged its staff travelling overseas on Friday to immediately return to the U.S. if they would be affected by the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEO Sundar Pichai issued a memo slamming Trump's order saying 100 employees were affected, Bloomberg  reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech company feared its employees, even though they have valid visas, would be stopped from returning to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg hit out at Trump condemning his anti-immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that,' Zuckerberg said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows reports that Muslim-majority countries with ties to Trump's business empire have been excluded from the order,&nbsp; Bloomberg  reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics show Trump doesn't have any business relations with the seven black-listed countries, but does with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order&nbsp;declares that US policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also&nbsp;gives Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order declares that the U.S. will 'prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution.'&nbsp;But that only applies when 'the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also affected by the order is an Oscar-nominated Iranian director, who won't be able to attend the Hollywood award ceremony due to the new immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated in the best foreign&nbsp;film category for his movie The Salesman but there are fears he may now not be able to attend next month's Academy Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His native Iran, which is where The Salesman was filmed, is one of seven countries listed in Trump's executive order that has placed a 90-day pause on visas and immigration to the US.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Iran's Asghar Farhadi won't be let into the US to attend Oscar's. He's nominated for best foreign language film... #MuslimBan,' he wrote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One organisation is pursuing a legal case against the force for allegedly causing the deaths of up to 25 migrants, while aid workers on another ship say they were shot at in a &quot;serious and worrying attack&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International also accuses the force of shooting, beating and torturing refugees who are caught trying to flee Libya and forced back to land, warning that EU nations supporting the operations risk fuelling &quot;rampant ill-treatment&quot; and violations of international law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the harrowing tales emerging from asylum seekers who survive the treacherous journey to Europe have garnered no public response from governments supporting the coastguard as attempts to slow boat crossings continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK is conducting a three-month training programme seeing Royal Navy personnel deployed to pass on &quot;naval expertise&quot;, including how to safely approach, board and inspect vessels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Libyan navy representative told local television the Sea-Watch boat was not &quot;attacked&quot; but admitted there was an incident, claiming the NGOwas in Libyan waters - an allegation denied by the charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second potentially deadly incident involving the Libyan coastguard in months, following an attack on a M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) ship that was fired at and allegedly boarded as international staff took cover in August.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ship, marked clearly with MSF banners, is one of several humanitarian vessels conducting rescue operations outside of Libyan territorial waters as more refugees drown attempting treacherous journeys to Europe than ever before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passage between Libya and Italy has become the deadliest in the world, claiming the majority of more than 5,000 migrant lives lost in the Mediterranean Sea last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real total may be far higher, as the number who drown inside Libyan waters or wash up on the country's beaches is not routinely released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights found that migrants were being imprisoned, robbed, raped and subjected to force labour after &quot;dangerous, life-threatening interceptions&quot; by the Libyan coastguard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivors said they had seen coastguards shoot, murder and torture other migrants, leading the UN to urge Britain and other countries conducting training to ensure its &quot;human rights component is comprehensive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between Libya and other European nations have also been thawing, with Italy's decision to reopen its embassy in Tripoli sparking speculation it may be aiming to replicate the controversial EU-Turkey deal to slow crossings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWENTY thousand people finally gained access to electricity yesterday, after the power was turned on at the world's first green-energy refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two-and-a-half years, Syrians living in the Azraq camp in the deserts of northern Jordan have struggled with a lack of access to electricity, causing security, food storage and sanitation problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of lighting left residents fearful when walking to washrooms and toilets at night, prompting safety concerns for women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of power also made cooking and cleaning clothes more difficult and left youngsters unable to read or study at night, affecting their education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, thanks to a partnership with global furniture retailer Ikea, the purpose-built solar plant was switched on the first time, allowing people in 5000 shelters to connect a fridge, TV, fan, light and phone chargers to meet their living needs and stay in contact with relatives Kelly T Clements, deputy high commissioner of the UNHCR refugee agency, said: &quot;Today marks a milestone. Lighting up the camp is not only a symbolic achievement, it provides a safer environment for all camp residents, opens up livelihood opportunities, and gives children the chance to study after dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Above all, it allows all residents of the camps to lead more dignified lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Azraq opened in April 2014, those living there have relied on solar lanterns distributed on their arrival, with limited electricity introduced in January for some street lighting. However, the new infrastructure is a marked improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A partnership between UNHCR and the Ikea Foundation, the twomegawatt solar farm is the first of its kind and will cut the costs of running the vital shelter by almost &pound;1.2 million a year and slash carbon emissions by an annual 2,370 tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it reaches its full 5mw capacity, savings will increase and all of the camp's energy needs will be covered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &pound;7.5m development will also benefit the host community in Jordan, where energy costs are high, with an excess power fed into the national grid for free, also contributing to national renewables targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All funding has come from the Ikea Foundation, which raised &pound;26.3m for UNHCR through its Brighter Lives for Refugees campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the push, the home giant donated 85p for every LED lightbulb sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Per Heggenes, chief executive of the Ikea Foundation, said: &quot;The world's first solar farm in a refugee camp signals a paradigm shift in how the humanitarian sector supports displaced populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UNHCR Jordan will save millions of dollars, while reducing carbon emissions and improving living conditions for some of the world's most vulnerable children and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are very grateful to everyone involved, especially the Ikea customers and co-workers who took part in the Brighter Lives for Refugees campaign, the UNHCR, the Jordanian government, EDCO, and most of all, the Syrian and Jordanian people who made this project a reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 refugees worked on the construction of the solar facility under the supervision of Amman-based renewables firm Mustakbal, giving them a rare chance to earn an income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of this group will now continue as maintenance workers for the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clements said: &quot;Once again the partnership between Ikea Foundation and UNHCR has shown how we can embrace new technologies, innovation and humanity while helping refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May defends decision to close Dubs amendment and says it was only one of a number of routes by which vulnerable children could come to the UK&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers decided cap the number of orphaned Syrian children coming to the UK at 350 to stop fuelling people trafficking routes.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the so-called Dubs amendment that opened Britain's doors to unaccompanied Syrian children was acting as a pull factor for an increasing number of children trying to reach Europe, which exposed them to traffickers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's decision to close the scheme caused uproar, and today the Archbishop of Canterbury said he was 'saddened and shocked' at the decision.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the growing chorus of protest, Theresa May stood by the decision, insisting the Dubs route was only one of a number of routes by which Britain was resettling vulnerable children, adding that the Government's approach towards refugees is 'absolutely right'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was expected the Dubs scheme would resettle up to 3,000 people in the UK but the Government announced that just over 10 per cent of that figure will be taken in.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hundred children have been brought in under the scheme but it will close after another 150 are settled in the UK, it was announced.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cash-strapped councils had told the Government they lacked the resources to take in more child refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Rudd suggested local authority funding had to be considered in deciding how many child refugees could be settled&nbsp;under the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending the decision after an urgent question was called in the House of Commons today, Ms Rudd insisted:&nbsp;'I am clear that when working with my French counterparts, they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs Amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw. It acts as a pull.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It encourages the people-traffickers.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking at&nbsp;a press conference in Downing Street following talks with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Mrs May said the Dubs scheme was only one of a number of routes by which vulnerable children from war-torn Syria can find sanctuary in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister said: 'We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right, on top of course of the significant financial support and humanitarian aid we are giving to refugees in the region of Syria - a commitment of &pound;2.3 billion, the second biggest bilateral donor.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         UK SCHEMES THAT WILL STILL GIVE CHILDREN HOPE                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The so-called Dubs Amendment was designed to allow unaccompanied children living in EU refugee camps without any family links to Britain to come to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youngsters can still come to Britain under several other measures, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Dublin Regulation, they can apply to enter the country if they are in an EU refugee camp and have family here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain also accepts children fleeing war-torn states outside the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has accepted 4,400 individuals directly from Middle East camps under an international programme to help displaced Syrians, half of whom are children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws to allow unaccompanied children without any relatives in Britain to enter the UK came after a campaign spearheaded by Lord Dubs, who fled the Nazis as a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation did not specify a figure but campaigners and politicians originally called for 3,000 children to be accepted. Ministers now say arrivals will stop in March once they reached 350.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Archbishop Justin Welby reacted furiously to the decision to end the Dubs amendment scheme.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a lengthy statement today, he said he had believed ministers were 'committed to welcoming up to 3,000 children under this scheme' and it is 'regrettable' such a small proportion have been given sanctuary in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His intervention piles further pressure on the Government, which has been heavily criticised by Lords and MPs in Parliament after it quietly announced the cap of lone child refugees being brought to Britain.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Welby said: 'I was saddened and shocked to read in the ministerial statement released yesterday that only 350 children will be received under the regulations in the Dubs amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Our country has a great history of welcoming those in need, particularly the most vulnerable, such as unaccompanied children. '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said refugees 'are treasured human beings' who 'deserve safety, freedom and the opportunity to flourish', and he hopes the Government will reconsider the decision.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were angry scenes in the Lords when Home Office minister Baroness Williams of Trafford denied the scheme had been closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour's Lord Dubs, who spearheaded the amendment, said he was puzzled by the claim and accused ministers of breaching their own commitments by 'arbitrarily closing down' the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory Lord Cormack said concern over the Government's stance was not confined to the Labour and Liberal Democrat benches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal Democrat Baroness Sheehan said it was 'palpably faulty' to suggest local authorities had reached the 'end of the road' with the scheme and accused the Government of being 'disinterested in taking any more'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lady Williams said this was 'absolutely wrong' and urged local authorities or community groups willing to help to contact the Home Office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump will honour the refugee deal with Australia despite his hard-line stance on immigration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump's decision was reported by multiple media sources after the US president spoke with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over the phone on Sunday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 25-minute conversation was their first since the billionaire's inauguration last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came just days after Mr Trump's decision to put a four-month block on refugees entering the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull struck a 'one-off' deal with former US president Barack Obama in November to resettle refugees detained on Manus and Nauru in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump confirmed his administration would continue to honour the 2016 refugee resettlement arrangement while acknowledging a common interest in preventing irregular and illegal migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two committed to making the long-standing relationship between the two countries even stronger and sharing the ongoing objective to defeat Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will continue to work together to improve global instability, including in the Asia-Pacific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Both leaders emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally,' the White House said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said Mr Turnbull was 'pleased with the outcome' of his discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters at the G'day USA gala in Hollywood, Ms Bishop said Mr Turnbull would travel to the US for a yet to be scheduled meeting with the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump has come under fire after signing an executive order putting a temporary stop to refugees and people from certain countries entering the US, but he said that the step was 'not a Muslim ban'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek said every country had the right to do strong background checks on people that they were considering for permanent residency or citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But those background checks shouldn't be based on assumptions based on a person's country of origin, ethnicity or religion,' she told reporters in Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For 40 years Australia has had a non-discriminatory immigration policy, and our Australian government needs to be crystal clear that that will continue in Australia.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens Leader Richard Di Natale said Mr Turnbull must take a stand against Mr Trump's immigration decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have got to make a choice, we are either a lap dog to the US and fall in behind them no matter what they do... or we take a stand and we recognise there has to be a line drawn around what are moral issues,' Senator Di Natale told Sky News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call to Mr Turnbull, in the presence of the president's chief strategist Stephen Bannon and national security adviser Mike Flynn, was the last of a series of calls from the Oval Office to world leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Mr Trump are reported to have agreed on the fundamental importance of the NATO alliance and that all NATO members must pay a fair share for their collective security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian President Vladimir Putin and the US president also want to co-operate in Syria to defeat Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But French President Francois Hollande warned Mr Trump against taking a protectionist approach, saying it would have economic and political consequences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Meet the families trapped in refugee camps after fleeing war</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1302  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shakila Mosanafe shows off a picture on her phone of a cityscape at night,  dramatically lit with twinkling lights.&quot;My city,&quot; she says, her eyes  filling with tears. &quot;I want to go home. I want to go to Iraq,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shakila, 17, is one of around 200 refugees living in the Bujanovac camp in southern Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 7,300 refugees are trapped in the  Baltic nation - unable to move onwards into  western Europe since the border with Hungary was closed over a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is here with her parents, 20-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister. She says she still does not understand why her family decided six months ago that they had to leave their home, where she had friends and her school life. They are protecting her from the truth, she believes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They know something,&quot; she says. &quot;I told my mother I didn't want to go and she started crying and said: I am going for you, not for myself'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shakila's father was involved in Kurdish  opposition politics in Iran, where she lived until she was a toddler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She remembers a moment during the family's treacherous journey of almost 2,000 miles when they were packed by people smugglers into a van in the middle of a forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In that moment, my dad was crying,&quot; she remembers. &quot;I was so scared. I was hugging my sister. That was only the second time I saw my dad cry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the refugees, bar none, have been forced to pay people smugglers thousands of pounds - for most, their life's savings - to get them to Serbia. All have stories about the horrific conditions they endured on what has become known as &quot;the Journey&quot; from the Middle East to the outermost borders of Europe, which involves treacherous boat trips in overcrowded dinghies and arduous hikes across mountainous regions lasting for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All hope they will be able to progress to claim asylum in western Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khalid Mortazazata, an Iranian high school  English teacher, tells of his family's treatment at the hands of the Bulgarian mafia, who stripped him, his wife and two young children to their underwear and left them at the side of the road in freezing temperatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khalid himself is no stranger to being a refugee. As a teenager, the 38-year-old university- educated Kurd had been forced to flee Iran due to his father's involvement in the opposition PDKI party - to settle in Iraq, where he lived  peacefully for the next 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He met his wife, Abdulla, and the pair had two children, Danyal, seven, and Roza, four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life was good for the family. Then political tensions began to increase. &quot;They said they were against us and they would kill us,&quot; he said. &quot;That was when we decided to go. We did it for the kiddies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After paying smugglers $11,500 (&pound;9,000), the family travelled across the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was in Bulgaria - a member nation of the European Union - that they ran into the worst problems. Smugglers packed them into a minivan to transport them to the  Serbian border but less than half an hour later they were caught by the local mafia - who he believes was working with some of the  smugglers - and stripped to their underwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They took the clothes from all of the children, men and women,&quot; he remembers. &quot;They took everything. Our mobiles, clothes, shoes and bags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of them wanted to put his hand on the breast of my wife - they were searching for  money and mobiles. But my wife reacted to them and they broke her hand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a gun which they put to the head of each of us. They had knives. They said: If you do anything we will kill you'. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To save our kids, we said we wouldn't do anything. That night we spent without clothes, just underwear. It was very cold, it was September.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds: &quot;It was one of the most terrible nights in my life. The children were crying and shaking in the cold weather. When I remember that night, I never wish that it happened in anybody's life, not just me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually a smuggler in Sofia sent a car to pick them up and they later continued their journey to the Serbian border, where they were picked up by local police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police were very kind,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He still believes that leaving Iraq was the right - and only - decision.&quot;I just want to be safe,&quot; says Khalid simply. &quot;I had no  economic problems in Iraq.&quot; He has a  certificate from the United Nations' refugee arm, UNCHR, instructing that he should be &quot;protected from forcible return&quot; to a country where he could be in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His sister is settled in Germany and his brother lives in London. Both left years before the refugee crisis began in earnest and were able to straight- forwardly claim asylum in Europe due to their father's political history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, like the thousands of other refugees in Serbia, Khalid has to wait his turn for his number to be called to the Hungarian border, where only a handful of refugees a day are being allowed through. Even some of those who are granted the chance of an interview with border officials are still turned back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can live our lives normally here,&quot; he says of the camp where he is a  community leader and has started teaching English to other residents. &quot;It is good. But it is not our aim to spend our lives here [in a refugee camp]. We don't  complain about our situation but it is not what we want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since we met, Khalid has travelled again - smuggling his family over the border to Romania, where he is now in a camp near the northern city of Baia Mare - and hopes that the fact the country is an EU nation will allow him to eventually be granted permission to travel on to Germany, to allow him to live with his sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is better here,&quot; he says. &quot;In Serbia, it was like we were in prison because we could not move around, but here we can visit  other cities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees living at the Bujanovac camp are lucky: most families have their own room, packed tightly with bunk-beds. Food is provided on a regular basis in a canteen by staff from a local organisation,  Philanthropy, a project which is funded by the UK charity Christian Aid. The sense of community at this camp is strong. The children play happily together as they wait for food to be served and the women chat. A toddler is being looked after by other  residents after her mother was admitted to  hospital following complications relating to the birth of her second child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over dinner, Mohammed Ismail Omeri, 43, a perpetually smiling shopkeeper from Kabul who led his seven children and pregnant wife to Serbia from Afghanistan, introduces his ten-year-old daughter who has barely spoken since the family left their home, where Mohammed says he was robbed every day on his way back from work. The noise of bomb blasts and fear of Taleban attacks in their home town has left the child unable to do much else other than cry, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife, Shamim, 36, who has given birth to their eighth child since arriving at Bujanovac, is also badly affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My wife has lost her memory sometimes,&quot; he says. &quot;She has seen a lot of bad things and sometimes she doesn't know where she is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their journey included a two-day stay in prison on the Iraq-Turkey border, during which he lost touch with his wife and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was thrown in the water [by police] and it was after that that I finally found my family,&quot; he says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well aware of the risks involved in  continuing the journey, Mohammed focused on getting his family to Europe, where he hopes they will be cared for, no matter what happens to him. He says the most terrifying moment was when the people smugglers packed his family into a small overcrowded boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was when I was sitting on that small boat with 50 people that I was scared,&quot; he says. &quot;I was thinking that I would die here on this boat, that we would all die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was not deterred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought I will start my journey and go to my destination,&quot; he says. &quot;It is better that I die like that. If I die there, what would happen to my children, who would take care of them?&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Archbishop of Canterbury has said he is &quot;saddened and shocked&quot; by the Government's decision to cap the number of lone child refugees being brought into the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Most Rev Justin Welby joined a wave of Conservative MPs in condemning the &quot;regrettable&quot; move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers have announced that just 350 children will be brought to the UK under the &quot;Dubs Amendment&quot;, far fewer than the 3,000 originally expected. At least three Tory MPs have openly criticised the Government, with one even calling for a judicial review of the decision, which was announced by Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May yesterday defended the Government's refugee policy, insisting that its approach is &quot;absolutely right&quot; and pointing to separate schemes which will resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees from camps over five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister said: &quot;We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right, on top of course of the significant financial support and humanitarian aid we are giving to refugees in the region of Syria - a commitment of &pound;2.3 billion, the second biggest bilateral donor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urging the Government to reconsider, the Archbishop said: &quot;I was saddened and shocked to read in the ministerial statement released yesterday that only 350 children will be received under the regulations in the Dubs Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our country has a great history of welcoming those in need, particularly the most vulnerable, such as unaccompanied children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugees, like all people, are treasured human beings made in the image of God who deserve safety, freedom and the opportunity to flourish. Jesus commands us to care for the most vulnerable among us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent reference to Donald Trump's travel ban, he added: &quot;We must resist and turn back the worrying trends we are seeing around the world, towards seeing the movement of desperate people as more of a threat to identity and security than an opportunity to do our duty. We cannot withdraw from our long and proud history of helping the most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I very much hope that the Government will reconsider this decision, and work with church groups and others to find a sustainable and compassionate solution that allows those most in need to find sanctuary in our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative MPs, including David Burrowes, Heidi Allen and Will Quince have all raised concerns about the Government's reversal. Ms Allen said it was a &quot;very, very poor result&quot; and said she would back a judicial review. Mr Quince said the cap made him &quot;sad and disappointed&quot;. Mr Burrowes accused ministers of having &quot;cut and run from child refugees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Parliament, Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, attacked Ms Rudd, saying: &quot;How does she live with herself, leaving thousands of children subject to disease, people trafficking, squalor and hopelessness?&quot; Ms Rudd said it was the children that mattered most and it was &quot;an absolutely disgraceful&quot; situation on the borders of Europe, due to the amount of people being trafficked.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one studying Theresa May's record as home secretary and prime minister could question her commitment to border control. She has staked everything - her reputation, her authority and, by extension, the future of the country - on this one issue. She wants Britain to admit fewer foreigners, regardless of their country of origin or their motive for making the journey. This wins few friends on the continent, where politicians accuse Mrs May of lying to make her case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fixation with outsiders explains the government's decision to abandon commitments made last year to give sanctuary to unaccompanied child refugees. When Mr Cameron acquiesced to the scheme - introduced as an amendment to a bill cracking down on illegal immigration - the universal expectation was that help would be provided for at least 3,000 children. To date, there have been only 350 beneficiaries of the &quot;Dubs amendment&quot;, named after the peer who proposed it - himself once a child refugee from the Nazis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amber Rudd, the home secretary, told MPs on Thursday  that the scheme had become &quot;a magnet for people traffickers&quot; and that the government must avoid &quot;incentivising&quot; migration. This is consistent with the prime minister's position, repeated at an EU summit last week, that the continent should be mindful of &quot;pull factors&quot;  encouraging people&nbsp;to make perilous journeys to Europe. This is a disingenuous way to frame the issue. It implies that cutting off the &quot;pull&quot; represented by miserly offers of sanctuary to the few can mitigate the &quot;push&quot; of a bloody civil war in Syria. Citing the nasty business of trafficking in this context smears innocent refugees by association with the criminals by&nbsp;whom they are exploited when terror drives them to flee their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's auxiliary argument is that other routes for asylum are available. This too is flimsy. Lord Dubs proposed his amendment because the scale of the refugee crisis vastly outweighed the volume of help being offered by Britain. Mr Cameron refused to join an EU arrangement to disperse refugees throughout the union. A charitable impulse had to be  forced out of him by parliament. Mrs May has amplified her predecessor's resistance to burden-sharing, confident that public attitudes are hardening. Xenophobic nationalists are polling well in many EU countries and one now controls the White House. The prime minister has observed the awkward predicament of Angela Merkel, whose first impulse of generosity was quickly tempered by rebukes from domestic rivals and fellow EU leaders. Donald Trump uses Europe's angst over refugees from predominantly Muslim countries as a racist parable of Christian civilisation under threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Stopping the Dubs scheme for child refugees is shameful and heartless | Stella Creasy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May calculates that the acceptance of refugees in any numbers constitutes a political problem. She sees the provision of asylum not as a moral or legal duty but as a risk of contamination. She looks at Europe's refugees as a continental affliction best managed by quarantine. And she will gladly suffer the opprobrium of liberal-minded MPs, charities and religious leaders - including the archbishop of Canterbury - if it means escaping wrathful tabloid headlines stoking fear of invading foreign hordes. The numbers actually involved in the Dubs scheme are tiny, the least the government could do after every effort had been made to prick ministerial consciences. Now even that ember of compassion is to be extinguished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manner of its snuffing out - the news buried in a statement issued on the eve of parliament's recess - proves that the government knows what it has done is shameful. That does not mean the prime minister or home secretary are truly ashamed. They hope the moment will pass; that not enough people will care about the cold-blooded cruelty of their actions; that the political cost of callousness is negligible. For the sake of Britain's reputation as a country that still knows some solidarity with victims of war and terror, we must hope they are wrong. Mrs May must reverse this decision or be haunted by it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PONTYBEREM has celebrated its efforts in bringing Syrian refugee families to its community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carmarthenshire charitable group Syria Sir Gar held an open public meeting this week to mark the arrivals of Syrian families to the town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting provided the opportunity for updates on the group's work in providing aid to vulnerable individuals and families who relocate to the Carmarthenshire area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carmarthenshire County Council leader  Emlyn Dole and deputy leader Pam Palmer were in attendance at a Syria Sir Gar meeting on Monday night to welcome the new arrivals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria Sir Gar has so far placed families in Llanelli, Carmarthen, Ammanford, Kidwelly and Pontyberem, with further asylum seekers from Syria anticipated over the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding for the schemes to aid the refugees, in accord with Britain's UN Charter commitments, is supplied from the Government's International Development Fund. &quot;It does not  draw on money from local council taxpayers,&quot; said Councillor Palmer. &quot;The five-year rolling programme will enable refugees to access jobs, health provision, school places, transport and language opportunities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councillor Dole welcomed the possibility of refugees integrating into local Welsh communities, &quot;with the prospect of launching their own Syrian businesses in retail fields such as catering and tailoring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public are invited to a Welsh-Syrian party in Pontyberem Hall, featuring foods from both cultures and a chance to learn key friendly terms in Arabic, English and Welsh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Syria Sir Gar are also working on plans for a new refugee family to arrive in Kidwelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We held a meeting at the end of January to update residents on the work that we're doing, and how they can get involved to give the Syrian refugees their support,&quot; Syria Sir Gar secretary Paolo Piana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been overwhelmed by the generosity of those who have been willing to spend the time with the families. We've had families who have taken our newly-arrived families out bowling and for other activities, all with the view of helping them acclimatise into their new community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing I would like to say is that I think the partnership between Syria Sir Gar, Carmarthenshire County Council and EYST (the Ethnic Youth Support Team) regarding the rehoming of these Syrian families into the County of Carmarthenshire has been an outstanding achievement,&quot; Stephen John, Kidwelly town mayor added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As for the family about to become housed in Kidwelly, I wholeheartedly welcome it and we as a community look forward to welcoming the family into our wonderful town.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After speaking to people who have moved into Kidwelly over the years, they have told me what a warm and welcoming community we have here and are sure the Syrian family will be welcomed in the same way that they were.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that Kidwelly being asked to take the Syrian family into the community by Syria Sir Gar speaks volumes about our town; they obviously believe the family will be given a lot of support to integrate and become involved into the life of our welcoming and diverse community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the family are due in town within the next two weeks, and would ask that the residents of Kidwelly give them time to settle in and then we can give them a proper Kidwelly welcome with the help of Syria Sir Gar.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attacks on refugee accommodation have doubled in Austria, seeing homes firebombed, vandals spray Nazi graffiti on walls and a man threaten to &quot;get a gun and shoot the dogs&quot;. The interior ministry revealed the figures at the request of an MP, who said the vast majority of cases were motivated by hatred and called for more to be done to catch the culprits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albert Steinhauser, an opposition Green party politician, said he was dismayed to find out that more than three quarters of the 49 recorded cases remain unsolved. &quot;The most important thing is for the interior ministry to take these incidents seriously and make every necessary effort to investigate,&quot; he told the Austria Press Agency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the incidents was a firebombing that saw two Molotov cocktails launched at a refugee home in Himberg, Lower Austria, in November. It was one of several reported arsons, including a fire in Rohrbach, Upper Austria, in June, which damaged one accommodation centre so badly it had to be evacuated and rebuilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said refugees were put at severe risk in August when assailants broke into a storage unit and cut a gas supply hose &quot;to cause a leak&quot; that went unnoticed for more than a week. Authorities said the motivations of the perpetrators were unknown, but they could have caused poisoning or a gas explosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, a man approached a centre in the Alpine town of Imst and shouted threats at asylum seekers, saying he would &quot;get a gun and shoot the dogs&quot;. He was later arrested. The following month, a man falsely posing as a police officer entered a home in Fulpmes armed with a baton to carry out a supposed &quot;inspection&quot;. Other attacks involved fireworks, paintball guns and homemade Molotov cocktails, while others saw stones and other projectiles launched at windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most incidents involved vandalism, including the smashing of windows and spraying of racist and Nazi graffiti, including swastikas, the phrase &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; and SS runes. Activists believe many more incidents may have occurred in 2016 than the 49 officially recorded, compared to 25 in 2015. The interior ministry also listed numerous attacks and threats by asylum seekers, including carers being threatened with &quot;decapitation&quot; gestures in Linz, where another refugee told his supervisor &quot;I will kill you all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two sexual assaults were recorded. In one attack in Bad Hall in June, a female supervisor was threatened with a smashed glass, pinned to a wall by the neck and assaulted until she managed to flee. A female worker was repeatedly assaulted by a migrant in Poysdorf, attempting to kiss her, grabbing her breasts and leaving her with a bleeding lip on one occasion. A female social worker was forcibly held in her office and prevented from making phone calls by three Afghan asylum seekers in G&ouml;rtschach, who told police they terrorised her for five hours &quot;because she was a woman and a 'bitch'&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to look closely at what the causes are. We strongly suspect that trauma, experiences of war and extreme violence play a role,&quot; Mr Steinhauser said, calling for better psychiatric care. In all but two of 49 violent incidents or threats against workers recorded at refugee homes the perpetrators were caught, the interior ministry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 130,000 people have applied for asylum in Austria since the start of the refugee crisis, with the country sitting on the route from the Greek islands into western Europe. In neighbouring Germany, more than 900 attacks on refugee homes were recorded in 2016, with the arrival of more than one million asylum seekers driving a spike in political violence and hate speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austria, where the far-right Freedom Party (FP?-) has seats in Parliament and almost had its leader elected President last year, has been hardening its stance towards refugees this year. The government is doubling the amount of money offered to asylum seekers who leave the country voluntarily, while announcing plans to increase surveillance, ban the burqa and force refugees to sign an &quot;integration contract&quot; and work for benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian Kern, the Austrian Chancellor, announced he would be seeking an exception from accepting more asylum seekers under EU quotas. He argued that Austria had fulfilled its obligation and taken in its &quot;fair share&quot;, sending a letter to kick-start negotiations with the European Commission on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fewer than 14,500 migrants have been relocated from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy under a two-year plan that was supposed to see 160,000 people housed by September. Thousands of refugees continue to make treacherous sea crossings to Europe, with more dying than ever before on the passage between North Africa and Italy. More than 28,000 asylum seekers have arrived this year, mostly from Syria, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Iraq, with at least 905 dying in the attempt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMWORTH church leaders have slammed MP Christopher Pincher for his 'heartbreaking lack of compassion' over the plight of refugee   children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an open letter to Mr Pincher, twenty ministers across the town hit out at   him and other Conservative MPs for not backing a   move which could have   seen asylum offered to 3000 unaccompanied refugee   children  fleeing war-torn countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Continued on Page 2</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From front page</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter speaks of their   'profound disappointment' at Mr Pincher's vote against the amendment to the Immigration Bill which they say would have mandated the offering of asylum to the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter reads: &quot;As a direct result of your lack of support and that of your fellow   Conservative MPs, the UK Government has now felt free to backtrack on its previous public undertaking and to cut the offering of asylum to   unaccompanied children to just 350 in the current year, 85 per cent less than initially   proposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This heart-breaking lack of compassion for those most at risk in times of war is little short of a betrayal of our   country's heritage of welcoming those who have nowhere else to turn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would therefore urge you to reconsider your refusal to help the most vulnerable and to press the Government to reconsider their action and reopen the process of offering sanctuary to unaccompanied children at least to the levels proposed under the April 2016 Amendment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Rev Steve Jonathan,   minister at Elim Church in Glascote told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Herald</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that the decision to end the  Dubs Amendment in March had been made because ministers feared it was encouraging people traffickers. Unbelievable! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These children have already experienced abuses far beyond our comprehension, which is why they are seeking refuge in the first place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People trafficking is one of the greatest evils of our world, and closing down safe   sanctuary for these desperate   children is more likely to increase their chances of being trafficked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government's argument is preposterous   nonsense, at best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lord Dubs, who the amendment is named after, said: &quot;At a time when Donald Trump is banning refugees from   America, it would be shameful if the UK followed suit by   closing down this route to sanctuary for unaccompanied children just months after it was opened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Mr Pincher said: &quot;I have every sympathy of the general point the local church ministers make with respect to helping those who are vulnerable, but their letter is, I fear, inaccurate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, last year alone the United Kingdom welcomed over 8000 refugees and   children - 200 or so of them 'Dubs' children and 4,400 refugees from Syria.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also worth noting that the vote on the Immigration Bill last year did include an amendment to accept more refugee children into the country - and it is the responsibility of local authorities to find homes for them based on their capacity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local authorities have informed the Government they only have capacity for 400 unaccompanied children this financial year.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no 'U- turn' on the set number of refugees as the minister suggests because the Government, mindful of the challenges of local authority capacity, did not make one.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They should also be aware that Britain took 750 young refugees from the Calais camp 'the Jungle' when it was closed by the French authorities last year.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of these came from Syria?  Answer: eight.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the others came from around the world.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of these are not orphans.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have been sent to Europe by their parents,   who obviously hope for   the best, often via unscrupulous and dangerous people traffickers who have no   concern for these children's safety and who may sell them into slavery and prostitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is why it is much   better to support refugees in the places from which they come, or nearby, so they   are not encouraged to make long and dangerous journeys across Europe in the hands of ruthless criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Britain has done more than any other country except the United States in building camps and safe havens in and near to Syria and Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is also why Britain is sending &pound;200million to South Sudan and Somalia to tackle famine.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This kind of help is both compassionate and sensible because it helps vulnerable people without encouraging them to take dangerous risks.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This compassionate and   sensible help is what the   British government will   continue to provide.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office announced on Wednesday   the 'Dub' refugee scheme would be closing after just six months, having taken 350 children from camps in Europe. Original numbers were expected to be closer to 3,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thangam Debbonaire, MP for Bristol West, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inset</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,  accused the Home Office of trying to bury bad news, saying the department had &quot;sneaked&quot; out the announcement while many MPs were preoccupied by the last of the Article 50 debates yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By March, when the scheme will have taken in 350 Syrian or other Middle Eastern children who were displaced in camps in Europe, the door will be closed to any more lone refugees on the Continent, ministers have confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Alf Dubs, who pushed for the amendment to the Immigration Act 2016 to include provision for child refugees living in Europe, placed no number on the amount who should be taken in but suggested the UK could accommodate 3,000 of the most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was confronted by Ms Debbonaire during an urgent question in the House of Commons this morning, said the scheme was &quot;not closed&quot; but that, having held talks with councils, there would be no more places left once the 350 children had been homed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Debbonaire, a member of the all-party parliamentary group for refugees, told the Bristol Post: &quot;It's a shameful decision. With the Article 50 debate going on, they were banking on us not noticing and sneaked this out just before recess - that's my deeply held suspicion.  We should be proud  we are seen as a safe haven by children. There are thousands of unaccompanied children in Greece, which is hardly a well-heeled country. There alone there are 2,600 unaccompanied children and they say they have spaces for 1,200 of them within Greece. But that still leaves 1,400 without homes. We should be doing our share.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether she believed the Home Office was pointing the figure at local authorities for the closure, Ms Debbonaire replied: &quot;It looks that way to me. She [Ms Rudd] made a lot of that but the funding from Government [for the child refugees] lasts for one year and then it ends. What are councils meant to do after that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community democracy group Citizens UK estimate that 50 children are in Calais with more arriving every day, while Europol estimate that 10,000 children have gone missing since the conflicts began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Debbonaire called for the Home Secretary to create a minister for refuges and integration in order to prioritise those in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Rudd, who took the Home Office reins from Theresa May in July, said she believed she had a &quot;substantial&quot; ministerial team already but said she would &quot;keep it under review&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of the 350 taken in under the Dubs amendment, a further 700 unaccompanied children had arrived in the UK under separate EU-wide rules designed to reunite families, Ms Rudd added.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUSLIM travellers have reportedly been stopped from boarding flights and turned away from US border controls after President Donald Trump banned citizens from several Middle Eastern countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The so called &quot;Muslim ban&quot; came into affect after the new US president signed an executive order to prevent people from mainly Islamic countries from entering America - just days into his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump has closed US borders to all refugees for the next four months and has put a temporary ban in place for people travelling from half a dozen countries - even if they've been issued visas in the past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time he faced international condemnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as he signed the order at the Pentagon on Friday he made good on his promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;My 71 year old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and and he's being sent back to Iraq. Some US official told him that Trump canceled all visas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian refugees have been banned from the country indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will face particularly stringent restrictions and were singled out as &quot;detrimental to the interests of the United states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US president has also instigated a 120-day suspension on the US refugee resettlement programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme had allowed 85,000 people from war-torn countries to start a new life in the United States last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees will now be admitted on a case-by-case basis. Those claiming religious persecution will be processed and admitted if their religion is a minority religion in their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees who were in the air flying to the United States on Friday when the executive order was signed were detained and stopped at airports,&nbsp;The New York Times&nbsp;reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two refugees held at New York's John F. Kennedy airport launched a legal fight against the ban with the help of lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers battled to have their clients released and filed a motion to help others in similar situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, appeared to support Mr Trump's ban saying: &quot;It is time to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's move came under fierce criticism from civil rights campaigners, Democrat senators and business leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader said: &quot;Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it planned to file a federal lawsuit against the ban next week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lena Masri, the group's director of National Litigation said: &quot;There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google urged its staff that was affected by the ban to come back to the US immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook wrote in a post that he was concerned about the impact of the executive orders and planned to work with a charity called Fwd.US to create protections for child immigrants brought to the US by their parents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department said that Britons with dual nationality with the countries Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen will be stopped at the American border for the next 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation, which broke late on Saturday night, sent Downing Street scrambling for a response and has triggered uproar from MPs.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians said tens of thousands of Britons could be caught up in the border chaos as Mr Trump's new immigration rules impact on holidays and business trips.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear last night whether Theresa May was aware the rules change was going to affect Britons despite spending hours meeting Mr Trump and his top staff in the White House on Friday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May met with President Donald Trump on Friday.Credit:      AP/AP     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department said: &quot;Travelers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or nonimmigrant visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or nonimmigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period.&nbsp; Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May had refused twice to publicly condemn Mr Trump's ban on refugees from those seven countries earlier in the day during a press conference in Turkey.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is responsible for the United States's policy on refugees,&quot; she said after being pressed a second time to condemn the border tightening.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MPs expressed their &quot;heartbreak&quot; at the development last night and called for Mr Trump to urgently overturn the policy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadhim Zahawi, the MP for Stratford-on-Avon who was born in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, said he feared he would be caught up in the ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just think of all the families who will feel like second class citizens now,&quot; he told The Sunday Telegraph.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love the US, I love everything it stands for, but I cannot believe this is happening to British citizens in 2017.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Words cannot describe my sadness. I feel devastated &nbsp;I would like clarity and a rethink on this. It is a terrible message to the world. I am heartbroken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office, Number 10 and the Home Office all refused to comment when asked about the rule change on Saturday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Government source said simply: &quot;We are working really closely with the State Department on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest figures show that more than 250,000 people have dual British nationality who were born in Iraq, Iran and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No figures are available for those born in Syria, Libya, Sudan or Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was chaos and confusion at airports around America on Saturday, as customs officials sought to implement the executive order that prevents entry to Syrians indefinitely, all other refugees for four months and bans travellers from seven Middle Eastern countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,&quot; the president said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. &quot;Don't want them here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as several foreign governments condemned the decision, Theresa May, the Prime Minister, who has sought to develop close ties with Mr Trump, avoided criticising the president's actions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being asked three times if she condemned the decision to ban families fleeing slaughter in war zones, Mrs May said: &quot;The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers and human rights groups took legal action, filing lawsuits which argued that the orders went against both the spirit of the US constitution and the letter of American law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order, which came into force as soon as Mr Trump signed it on Friday afternoon, requires US border officials to turn away any person arriving from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for the next 90 days, whether or not they have a green card.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only a few exceptions for diplomats and dual citizens, the order takes no account of whether travellers have already been issued with visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing his &quot;extreme vetting&quot; plan, Mr Trump invoked the &nbsp;September 11, 2001 attacks. But most of the 19 plane hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon - all countries not included on the ban list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of the order being signed, chaos broke out at airports around the world as officials sought to understand and interpret the new policies.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Al Rawi, a graduate of California State University and former journalist with the Los Angeles Times, said his father had been hauled off a flight in Qatar as a direct result of Mr Trump's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My 71-year-old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and he's being sent back to Iraq. Some US official told him that Trump cancelled all visas,&quot; he wrote on Facebook hours after the order was signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an Egypt Air flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some airlines have warned that all passengers whose journeys began in any of the seven countries may be affected, even if their own citizenship is not on the &quot;banned&quot; list.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamaseh Tayari, a UK resident who holds an Iranian passport, who had been on holiday &nbsp;in Costa Rica, found she was unable to board her plane back to Glasgow because her flight went via New York. She found her transit visa had been revoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Tayari, who grew up in Italy and works as a vet in the UK told the Guardian she had &nbsp; never experienced anything like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that this is not just happening to refugees,&quot; she said. &quot;I am a graduate and I have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and who pays tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Zellar, an army captain who runs No One Left Behind, a charity that seeks to bring to the US Afghanis and Iraqis who worked with the American military in their countries, said the bans had caused their programmes to be suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zellar works with people who have been placed on death lists by the Taliban, Isil, or other extremist organisations for the time they spent working with the US military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told The Sunday Telegraph that the process of getting these men and their families into America had always been laborious, sometimes taking them up to five years to obtain a visa. But the executive order was forcing him mostly to suspend the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;Some have been waiting years, moving night by night and living away from their families to escape death squads,&quot; Mr Zellar said. &quot;This closes out their last hope. Heroes and patriots who saved American lives are going to die for their service to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive order includes a potential loophole that says the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a &quot;case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Zellar said repeated efforts to reach the White House to get permission to apply this to former US military employees had failed.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's decision to close America's borders to refugees was causing confusion and chaos at airports across the US, as people fleeing war zones were turned away by customs officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ban is now being met with several high profile challenges from lawyers at civil rights organisations who say that the demands made in the  executive order may be illegal .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immigration and Nationality Act, implemented by congress in 1965&nbsp;banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;President Lyndon B&nbsp;Johnson said as he signed the law that &quot;the harsh injustice&quot; of the national-origins quota system had been &quot;abolished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law states that&nbsp;&nbsp;no person could be &quot;discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detentions at airports around the US&nbsp;have&nbsp;prompted legal challenges. The New York Times reported  that lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy Airport filed a writ of habeas corpus early Saturday in the Eastern District of New York seeking to have their clients released. At the same time, they filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Iraqis, Khalid Darweesh, worked for the US government in Iraq for a decade. Whilst the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to the United States to join his wife and young son, the lawyers said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She proceeded to praise Britain's record on refugees, but avoided commenting on US policy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is responsible for the United States policy on refugees,&quot; she said when pressed on the issue a second time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

Turnbull must find a humane way forward; <BR>Trump is set to sign executive orders imposing a freeze on all refugee resettlement - those detained offshore should be brought to safety in Australia</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With US President Donald Trump set to expose further holes in our government's already uncertain refugee deal, prime minister Malcolm Turnbull must urgently find a humane way forward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump is set to sign executive orders imposing a four month freeze on all refugee resettlement to the US and drastically reducing America's refugee intake thereafter, slashing it by 60,000 places. Additional restrictions will also apply to people from refugee producing countries such as Syria, Iran and Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull and immigration minister Peter Dutton are predictably putting on a brave face and acting like everything is fine, but the writing is well and truly on the wall. While a painfully long and narrow road to the US may possibly still exist for some, no one on Manus or Nauru will be going to the US anytime soon and many now seem unlikely to ever go at all. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  We can resettle refugees in Australia and it's not just wishful thinking. This is how | Jane McAdam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragedy is that when the US deal was first announced many people stuck on Manus and Nauru began to feel hopeful and optimistic for the first time in years - after three years of limbo, our government was finally acknowledging that it couldn't just leave them languishing on remote islands forever. Having those hopes dashed will cause absolute despair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first time I went to Manus was in the weeks after Iranian refugee Reza Barati was murdered in February 2014. The men I met back then spoke of the incredible tension and fears of further violence inside the centre. They also described the boredom of having nothing to do, spending day after day trapped behind the same fences - the sheer nothingness of it all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what caused them the most anguish was the indefinite nature of their situation. Would they be there for a month? A year? Forever? They had no idea if or when or to where they would ever be resettled. They had no idea if or when they would ever see their families again. They were in perpetual limbo, which one of the men described as a &quot;mental torture&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were exhausted back then. And that was three years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is our government's responsibility to urgently find a humane way forward. Time and time again immigration minister Peter Dutton has nailed his colours to the mast and insisted that the men, women and children on Manus and Nauru will never be brought to Australia. But that position becomes more and more untenable by the day. The government has already conceded that Manus and Nauru are dead ends. The Cambodia deal is a costly and cruel failure. It's now clear the US deal won't be enough to ensure safety for all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is out of options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to finding a way forward for those stuck on Manus and Nauru the Turnbull government must also end the limbo of the 370 people already here after being evacuated for urgent medical treatment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group includes women sexually assaulted on Nauru, men violently beaten on Manus and children so traumatised by what they have seen in offshore detention that they have required psychiatric inpatient treatment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Nauru, detention, the ABC and us: putting misconceptions about Australia and refugees to rest | Richard Ackland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also includes more than 40 babies born right here in Australian hospitals - children who have now taken their first steps and spoken their first words in our communities but who remain at risk of sudden deportation to Nauru. While they are temporarily safe from the horrors of offshore detention, these children and their families are being forced to go to sleep every night worried they will one day be returned to harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three and a half years of limbo, enough is enough. The people being warehoused on Manus and Nauru should be evacuated to safety in Australia. Those already here should be allowed to stay and continue rebuilding their lives in our communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lives of the 2000 people on Manus and Nauru and the 370 already here are in Turnbull's hands, not Trump's. Whatever the policy challenge, continuing to cause them serious harm isn't the solution. It's time for Turnbull to show some leadership and principle and do the decent thing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these institutions - in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey - lack the capacity to deal with the scale of the refugee crisis and, in any case, often face problems of their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ideal of &quot;trying to solve the problem in the region&quot; is &quot;impossible&quot;, said Marcello Scalisi, executive director of the Mediterranean Universities Union (Unimed), an association of 98 institutions based around the shores of the inner sea. Meanwhile, he added, &quot;the position of European countries about refugees is quite confused&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unimed already facilitates European universities in integrating refugees from anywhere in the world through the inHERE programme. But this year has also seen the launch of another project, RESCUE (Refugees Education Support in MENA Countries), to open local universities up to Syrians who are now based in Jordan and Lebanon - as well as to displaced Iraqis in Kurdistan. The initiative forms part of the European Commission's Erasmus+ programme devoted to &quot;capacity-building in the field of higher education&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many refugee students had to leave Syria and would like to resume their studies,&quot; explained Raniero Chelli, senior project manager. &quot;Sometimes they don't have papers or the hosting countries have regulations that put constraints on enrolling foreign students.&quot; To address this, Unimed brought together three European universities (as required by such Erasmus+ projects) - Sapienza University of Rome, the University of Barcelona and the Technical University of Berlin - and then found local partners, either through their network or through the Association of Arab Universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each local institution is setting up a refugee student operational support unit, said Mr Chelli, &quot;a law office of people trained to deliver services to help them resume their university careers&quot;. Although details vary, all will deliver &quot;psychological support for people who have been traumatised&quot; as well as English courses. Relevant staff have been identified and are due to receive training or study visits to Europe, so the units should be running by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Erasmus+ programme is based on a model of &quot;cooperation for development&quot;, which implies, Mr Chelli suggested, that &quot;the European universities are very advanced and know how to help southern universities improve their way of working&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality, they needed to &quot;collaborate on the basis of sharing information and experiences&quot;, he explained, because Lebanese and Jordanian universities would sometimes say: &quot;We have been doing this for years now. We are dealing with [a refugee crisis] on a scale 10 times larger than you are. Perhaps we've got as much to teach you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate Syria Programme was launched by Cara (the Council for At-Risk Academics) in Istanbul last June. The organisation is supporting about 175 refugee Syrian academics who have managed to reach the UK as part of its core fellowship programme. But it is also looking to help the Syrian academics now based in Turkey whose numbers are estimated at about 1,000 by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blended approaches</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These scholars face a number of difficulties, according to programme director Kate Robertson. &quot;Their levels of English [and Turkish] make it difficult for them to function in Turkish universities or in the international arena,&quot; she said. They tend to lack &quot;professional connections&quot; and to be inexperienced in research. Meanwhile, Turkish institutions are &quot;very squeezed&quot; in terms of recruitment and are also trying to cope with the political aftermath of last summer's abortive coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To meet these challenges, Cara has brought together groups of UK universities to create blended learning courses in English for academic purposes and academic skills development, which are now being piloted. Even more significantly, it is bringing refugee Syrian academics to the UK for four to eight weeks for research incubation visits, to draw up joint proposals for research projects with individual academics or groups. This will also enable them to register with a partner university so that they can access online resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This approach should enable Syrian academics to hone their research skills, often by working in areas of public health, for example, which may well prove useful in post-conflict Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that much academic research now inevitably focuses on Syria and refugees, it can only help to incorporate academics with insider knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Robertson has been &quot;lobbying those who are putting in big research proposals to the [UK's] Global Challenges Research Fund, for example, to have budget lines that mean that they involve Syrian academics in the research on Syrian populations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For God's sake, involve Syrians, they can bring enormous knowledge to the table even if they are not perfect researchers,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Angela Merkel gears up for her third re-election later this year, observers could be forgiven for assuming that the issue which has come to dominate Germany's image abroad will only play a minor role in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year and a half after the German chancellor and her Austrian counterpart opened borders to thousands of refugees in September 2015, the anti-migrant party Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland has dropped in the polls to pre-crisis levels. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At last month's regional elections in Saarland, a state that had voluntarily taken in a larger share of asylum seekers than required, the refugee issue barely registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But two books published this spring suggest that Germans are still hungry for answers to what exactly happened in the autumn of 2015. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robin Alexander's Die Getriebenen (The Driven Ones), a political non-fiction thriller which reconstructs the backroom deals and rushed decisions behind the headlines, has sold 120,000 copies in less than a month and sits atop the bestseller charts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Merkel made catastrophic mistake over open door to refugees, says Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is followed this Friday by Konstantin Richter's Die Kanzlerin: Eine Fiktion (The Chancellor: A Fiction), the first novel to speculate what may have gone on in the German leader's mind in that same period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though neither book is unsympathetic to its protagonist - Alexander introduces his work as &quot;neither a tale of sainthood nor villainy&quot; - both propose that the refugee crisis has fundamentally changed the relationship between Germany's chancellor and her people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander, a parliamentary correspondent for the broadsheet Die Welt, paints Merkel's decision to keep open German borders not as the result of either rational planning nor moral righteousness, but tactical blundering and communication failures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The novel suggests that Merkel's Social Democratic coalition partners had been deliberately goading Merkel into action on the refugee issue because they knew that it represented a political minefield for a conservative chancellor: until autumn 2015, she had spent almost a decade avoiding an official visit to an asylum seekers' shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, Merkel changes her mind because polling indicates that she has the public mood on her side: a week before the border opening, a poll-of-polls states that up to 93% of the German population think the refugee crisis is the most important issue of the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Alexander's research also shows that a week later the German government was only a signature away from shutting the borders again, even to asylum seekers. In the end the barriers stayed up, the journalist writes, &quot;not because Merkel or anyone else in government had consciously made a decision that it should. It was simply that in the crucial hours no one stepped forward who wanted to take responsibility for the closure&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander charts with admiration how quickly a plan made up on the hoof in the chancellory is executed to perfection across the rest of the country. But The Driven Ones remains highly critical of the moral justifications for her decisions that Merkel presented to the public after the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richter's novel takes a more existential approach. The Chancellor: A Fiction is bookended by Merkel attending performances of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde at the Bayreuth festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'Either you're pro-refugee, or against': Bavarian town split after year of border controls</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richter paints a picture of a chancellor tired of her usual trial-and-error approach to politics and worn out by the burden of office. Not without a trace of vanity, the refugee crisis becomes a project of emotional self-discovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After visiting a refugee shelter in Heidenau and witnessing for the first time herself the hatred leveled at foreigners, Richter writes, &quot;she legitimised the emotions that she had learnt to ignore by allowing herself to feel with the refugees and making their cause her own&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before its official publication, the novel has already won both enthusiastic praise and damning indictment. &quot;Richter's interpretation will shape the international perspective on Merkel's late era in the same way that House of Cards did for the Thatcher years and Primary Colours did for the Clintons,&quot; wrote the Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes life writes the best stories,&quot; was the Frankfurter Allgemeine 's verdict, &quot;and the worst ones are written by authors who overestimate their talent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richter, a former Wall Street Journal staff writer who has also written for Politico and the Guardian, said he came up with the idea for his book after cycling past Merkel leaving her inner-city apartment one morning and having to explain her role to his young daughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my book I tried to portray the refugee crisis as the moment that could have been a defining moment in Merkel's career, and in the end it wasn't,&quot; Richter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way I saw it, Merkel felt the need to come up with a new approach to politics - more brave and more proactive - but couldn't make it work. And in the end she wasn't much wiser than at the beginning, only less popular, because the Germans are no longer sure what she is really about. There's a certain tragicomedy in that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CONSERVATIVE MP defended controversial comments she made in Parliament urging people to &quot;stop being so sentimental&quot; about refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pauline Latham sparked outrage with the remarks during a House of Commons debate on Thursday night.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stated Syrian children who had made it to Europe were in safe countries and under no threat.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MP for Mid Derbyshire claimed to take in young refugees to the UK was acting as a &quot;pull factor&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ms Latham later defended the comments in a series of tweets, insisting she had been &quot;misquoted&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate was held following the UK Government's decision to halt the intake of unaccompanied children from France.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downing Street had been expected to take 3,000 child refugees from European camps but instead closed the Dubs scheme after 350.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tory MP was speaking in the Commons on Thursday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the decision, Ms Latham told MPs in the Commons: &quot;These children are not under threat of murder, they are in safe countries, the governments should be dealing with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the desperate situation that the Syrian people are in, they are in a pretty safe place in those refugee camps.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are being fed, they are being given a health service, and their children are being given an education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should stop being so sentimental and be looking at what the best thing to do for these families and children and that keeps them in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARLI TV</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MP came under fire for her comments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversial remarks prompted anger from other politicians also taking part in the debate.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SNP Chris Law, who followed Ms Latham, said he was &quot;shocked, actually, to hear the last comments about sentimentality&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He fought back: &quot;Many children in Greece find themselves in detention centres where they're made to sleep in crowded, dirty, rat-infested cells, often without mattresses and are deprived of basic sanitation and privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is reported that some boys are even turning to prostitution to keep themselves alive. If I am sentimental for bringing this up then I am very proud to be so because these are some of the basic facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Chichester based charity has been working to provide safe education spaces for refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Rohingya crisis deepens, Children on the Edge has been providing education support for thousands of Rohingya refugee children on the Bangladesh border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh to escape intensive military counter-terrorism' operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UN report detailing devastating cruelty to Rohingya children, men and women was released this week, which called for the international community to urge the military in Myanmar to bring these operations to an end.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children on the Edge have been working in the Rohingya refugees' makeshift camps to provide education to 2,700 children in a safe environment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity's Asia regional manager, John Littleton, visited the Bangladesh camp earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The level of desperation is palpable. Not only is the physical landscape changing as dozens of bamboo, plastic, mud and stick huts are built each day, but there are lines of women and elderly people sat along the main road begging, in an area that is already resource scarce. I have been coming here over five years now and never seen this before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a softening in the wider community, and local violence towards the Rohingya is subsiding as it is dawning on people that these are not migrants', they are refugees fleeing from serious systemised abuse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is clear from the sheer numbers of people entering the camps, but also the visible levels of violence that these people have suffered. Families are arriving injured and bleeding, some without clothes, many in grief having witnessed the death of loved ones, this is not something you can ignore&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The schools facilitated by Children on the Edge are already at capacity, but the current focus is working with those children to create an atmosphere of safety and familiarity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers are trained from within the camps, and given specific guidance on supporting children living through trauma. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children on the Edge report that in the face of everything they have witnessed this year, the children are making great progress in their education. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent evaluation by of the schools by the charity, 92 per cent of children had exhibited signs of increased confidence and positive self-esteem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children on the Edge are continuing to invest in this work and are actively pursuing funds for the schools to ensure their sustainability, deliver high quality education and provide a protective environment for these children. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May does &quot;not agree&quot; with Donald Trump's refugee ban and will make representations if it hits Britons, Downing Street has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister arrived back in Britain to a storm of fury after she refused to condemn the US president's controversial ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative MPs were among the critics and one claimed he would be affected by the border clampdown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after Mrs May arrived back from a visit to Turkey, No 10 moved to stem the growing anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman said: &quot;Immigration policy in the United States is a matter for the government of the United States, just the same as immigration policy for this country should be set by our government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are studying this new executive order to see what it means and what the legal effects are, and in particular what the consequences are for UK nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is any impact on UK nationals then clearly we will make representations to the US government about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May was pressed repeatedly about her views on the refugee ban during a press conference in Ankara where she had been holding talks with Turkish leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After initially dodging questions, the Prime Minister then insisted it was up to America to devise its own policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told reporters: &quot;The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom's policy on refugees and our policy on refugees is to have a number of voluntary schemes to bring Syrian refugees into the country, particularly those who are most vulnerable, but also to provide significant financial contributions to support refugees in countries surrounding Syria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her decision to keep quiet about the actions of President Trump, who she met for talks in Washington on Friday, was roundly criticised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who is of Iraqi origin but a British citizen, said a US immigration lawyer had confirmed that he would be affected by the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A sad sad day to feel like a second-class citizen,&quot; he said. &quot;Sad day for the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Had confirmation that the order does apply to myself and my wife as we were both born in Iraq. Even if we are not dual Nat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a British citizen and so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear ill be banned from the USA based on my country of birth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MP Heidi Allen rounded on Mrs May for the way she had handled the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said on Twitter: &quot;Strong leadership means not being afraid to tell someone powerful when they're wrong. It's an ethos this country is proud of @theresa_may.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't care how special the relationship is, some lines just shouldn't be crossed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the refusal to speak out should &quot;sadden&quot; the country and the Lib Dems said it was &quot;shocking&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said the ban was &quot;both wrong in itself and very worrying for the future&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US president has barred all refugees from entering the US for four months but blocked those from war-ravaged Syria indefinitely as part of a plan to stop &quot;radical Islamic terrorists&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 90-day ban on entry to the US from seven Muslim-majority nations has been imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in the White House, Mr Trump said the ban was &quot;working out very nicely&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;It's not a Muslim ban but we were totally prepared. It's working out very nicely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see it at the airports, you see it all over, it's working out very nicely, and we are going to have a very, very strict ban and we are going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau said his country welcomed &quot;those fleeing persecution, terror and war&quot;, regardless of their faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said Mr Trump must not be invited to address both houses of Parliament from Westminster Hall on his state visit later this, pointedly insisting &quot;those who wish to fawn over him&quot; should do so elsewhere.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders on Friday, including one that will upgrade U.S. military readiness and a more controversial measure 'establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We don't want them here,' he said as military brass assembled applauded in the Pentagon's 'Hall of Heroes.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We want to make sure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,' Trump said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House waited more than two hours to release the final executive order, acting after DailyMail.com published a photograph taken Thursday aboard Air Force One that appeared to show most of one page on the president's desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order declares that U.S. policy is 'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         'EXTREME VETTING'                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order provides a list of possible mechanisms for 'vetting' prospective immigrants and catching those 'seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission.'</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It puts a 90-day pause on visas and immigration from Iraq, Syria, and other countries the State Department classifies as State Sponsors of Terror. At present, those include Sudan and Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it gives the Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order stops the State Department's entire U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days - and declares that refugees from Syria are not welcome until further notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that period of time, refugees will be accepted only from countries that the State and Homeland Security Departments decide are safe to work with.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft document on Trump's Air Force One desk referred to 'countries designated by Congress to pose a risk to national security.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights activists feared that the Trump administration aimed to end large portions of America's refugee resettlement program, particularly targeting displaced persons in terror-prone Middle Eastern nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Trump signed the order, he read along: 'This is &quot;the protection of the nation from foreign terrorists' entry into the United States&quot;.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We all know what that means,' he said, adding moments later: 'That's big stuff.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump was at the Pentagon to oversee a ceremonial swearing-in of James Mattis as secretary of defense. The retired U.S. Marine Corps general formally took his oath of office a week ago, following quick Senate approval on Inauguration Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's critics immediately framed the 'vetting' order as the real-world incarnation of a December 2015 campaign promise to bring about 'a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on' with terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That position is still on Trump's presidential&nbsp; campaign website. In subsequent months Trump backed off that promise, saying his intention was a nation-specific halt to the entry of people who presented a high risk of harboring nefarious intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called it a philosophy of 'extreme vetting,' and railed against Democrat Hillary Clinton for wanting to expand the Obama-era refugee program by 550 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Rescue Committee (IRC) called the suspension of the U.S. resettlement program a 'harmful and hasty' decision that would impact thousands of innocent people - 'mostly women and children.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'America has the strongest, most successful resettlement program in the world,' said IRC President and CEO David Miliband. 'Certified by successive administrations, the U.S. resettlement program makes it harder to get to the United States as a refugee than any other route. This is one of many reasons to deplore the hasty decision made today.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobel laureate Malala&nbsp;Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist for female education, said in a statement that she was 'heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yousafzai noted the plight of 'Syrian refugee children, who have suffered through six years of war by no fault of their own,' and said they were being 'singled-out for discrimination.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas congressman, said that the U.S. is 'a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants. But as we know, terrorists are dead set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan Horse to attack us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump expressed surprise during his White House run that Muslim refugees find an easier route to acceptance in the U.S. than Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told CBN News on Friday that his administration would do the reverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are going to help them,' he said. 'They've been horribly treated.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And the reason that was so unfair - everybody was persecuted, in all fairness - but they were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order declares that the U.S. will 'prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that only applies when 'the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RNLI Enniskillen crew member Olivia Cosgrove recently spent two weeks volunteering with Refugee Rescue, a voluntary search and rescue crew, set up by a lady from Ballyclare, that operates on the Greek island of Lesbos.<BR>&quot;I felt that I had a moral obligation to do something about the current refugee crisis,&quot; said Olivia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">A well-known face in Enniskillen due to her roles as founder of Row the Erne and Donor2Deed.com, Olivia decided to set off for Greece in a bid to put the training she had gained on an Atlantic 75 lifeboat with the RNLI to good use.<BR>No stranger to working with refugees and people displaced by war, famine and natural disasters, Olivia has worked in 14 countries since 1995, focusing on logistics and refugee camp management.&nbsp;<BR>In the past, she has witnessed refugees &quot;falling at our feet&quot; from starvation, disease or exhaustion. During her time in Greece, however, she was struck by how much she connected with the migrants from Kazakhstan, Iraq, Congo, Pakistan and Syria who were crossing the Aegean sea from Turkey to Greece.<BR>&quot;I connected with their vulnerability,&quot; Olivia explained. &quot;Maybe it was because they looked like us, or because they appeared strong and healthy, were wearing jeans and were taking selfies on their smartphones; I'm not sure.&nbsp;<BR>&quot;After the recent attacks in Manchester one wonders where we all fit in this large planet of diverse people. It's a crisis of our time,&quot; she continued.<BR>During her time in Lesbos, Olivia and the crew &quot;wrapped up and donned our dry suits before patrolling the waters either late at night (11pm - 3am) or early morning (4am to 8am).&quot;<BR>One morning, as she was still asleep, someone pounded the door and the crew were geared up and in their boat within six minutes. Describing the scene, Olivia said: &quot;I won't forget the race to get kitted up and running down to the harbour. Speeding out towards the vessel, we learned that there were approximately 60 on board with a mixture of men, women and children. The Greek Coastguard and Proactiva, a Spanish rescue boat, had also been alerted. We assisted getting all to shore safely where a landing team welcomed them.&nbsp;<BR>&quot;While we sat in the harbour and waited for the refugees to disembark I noticed a young lady stand in the queue. It is hard to describe her vulnerability. What was very noticeable was how she dressed and acted, very like how any of us would be. She appeared quiet and uncomfortable with the amount of people about. I hoped for her, hoped that life would be good for her and that as a species we drop this tag that we brand refugees with.&quot;<BR>She continued: &quot;There were other rescues: smugglers dropping groups off in the middle of the night close to the Greek shore before speeding back to Turkey under the cover of darkness. Often, he would throw everyone, young and old into the water away about 100 metres out from the rocky shoreline and tell them to swim to shore.&nbsp;<BR>&quot;Others came in impossibly small boats rigged to homemade fuel cans and small outboard engines.&nbsp;<BR>&quot;Not everybody made it across though. A week after I left, a capsize left 16 drowned and two survivors. The crews very patiently lifted body after body from the water. One, a young man called Baris Yazgri, who had dreamed of going to music school in Belgium, was still clutching his violin when he was lifted into the boat.&quot;<BR>Olivia explained that anyone who wanted to volunteer with Refugee Rescue as a crew member or a spotter, can find out more on www.refugeerescue.co.uk or to consider joining their local RNLI station.<BR>She concluded: &quot;All we can do is be there to help another human in any way we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A document released by the justice ministry in Tripoli did not give a reason for the move, which comes as an increasing numbers of migrants are launched by smugglers towards Europe with the arrival of spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The justice ministry of the Government of National Accord (GNA) confirms that the court is still examining the issue in order pending a ruling, and that no final judgement has been issued,&quot; it said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump and Putin build their new world order, starting with Libya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU leaders warned against making 'inhumane' deal to stop refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GNA is not recognised by Libya's Tobruk-based parliament, which backs a rival administration in eastern regions where a powerful Russian-backed warlord holds sway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rival parliament declared the agreement struck between Tripoli and Italy &quot;null and void&quot; in February and declared the GNA had &quot;no legal status in the Libyan state&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued conflict between warring parties since the Nato-backed removal of Muammar Gaddafi has worsened around crucial oil ports this month, endangering European efforts to replicate the EU-Turkey deal, which dramatically cut refugee crossings to Greece last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising arrivals to Italy sparked attempts to stem the flow by increasing cooperation with authorities in Libya, where 90 per cent of boats crossing the Central Mediterranean are launched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desperate journeys: Rescued at sea, refugees detail abuse in Libya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the UN-backed GNA is failing to regain territory controlled by factions including Isis, while armed gangs and smugglers have capitalised on widespread lawlessness to detain, extort, enslave and eventually export migrants for profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 5,000 asylum seekers were killed attempting the treacherous crossing in 2016 and a record of at least 583 more have died so far this year, with fears of another 240 drowning when their dinghies sunk last week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 240 refugees feared drowned in the Mediterranean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A deal struck between the Italian and Libyan prime ministers in February said it aimed to tackle people smuggling, with Paolo Gentiloni pledging millions of Euros and equipment to bolster the capacity of Libyan authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move, backed by fellow EU member states at a summit in Malta, alarmed the UN and humanitarian agencies who have long reported the murder, torture, rape and abuse of migrants in both government and militia-run detention centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Libyan coastguard, being trained by the UK and other European nations, is additionally accused of attacking international rescue ships, shooting refugees and causing hundreds to drown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 22,000 migrants have been rescued at sea and taken to Italy so far this year, mainly from sub-Saharan African countries and Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU leaders are aiming to shift some of the responsibility for search and rescue operations to the Libyan government and hope to set up new migrant camps in the country where failed asylum seekers can be returned to their home countries before journeying to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) cautioned that it could take a long time for facilities to meet international humanitarian standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a number of vital issues that need to be addressed regarding Libya,&quot; Stephane Jaquemet, the UNHCR's regional representative for southern Europe, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interior ministers from Libya, Tunisia, Italy, Germany, Malta and other nations affected by the crisis released a fresh declaration to tackle the root causes of migration and combat smuggling on Monday, but it was unclear how their aim can be achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions are also increasing over Russia's alleged support for General Khalifa Haftar, whose Libyan National Army resists the GNA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 73-year-old veteran, who served under Gaddafi before fighting to oust him in 2011, visited Moscow twice last year and was invited on to Russia's Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier as it returned from waters off the coast of Syria in January, for talks with the defence minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Michael Fallon criticised the discussions, saying: &quot;We don't need the [Russian] bear sticking his paws in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, responded by saying there was no &quot;animal in Britain's zoo that can tell a bear what to do&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Haftar has the backing of Egypt and the UAE but was shunned by Barack Obama's administration. Donald Trump's position remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of US forces in Africa said there was an &quot;undeniable&quot; link between Russia and General Haftar, saying Russian troops were on the ground and &quot;trying to influence the action&quot; in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marine General Thomas Waldhauser said the US would &quot;maintain a force&quot; in Libya, where it backed local forces in the offensive to drive Isis out of its stronghold of Sirte.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department said that Britons with dual nationality with Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen will be stopped at the US border for the next 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in a separate development last night, a US judge issued a temporary halt on the deportation of people who had already arrived in the US with&nbsp;valid visa but were being denied entry at border control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation about Britons sent Downing Street scrambling for a response and has triggered uproar among MPs.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians said tens of thousands of Britons could be caught up in the border chaos as Mr Trump's new immigration rules hit holidays and business trips.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear last night whether Theresa May was aware that the rules change would affect Britons despite spending hours meeting Mr Trump and his top staff in the White House on Friday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May met President Donald Trump on FridayCredit:      Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department said: &quot;Travellers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or non-immigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period. Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May had twice refused to publicly condemn Mr Trump's ban on refugees from those seven countries earlier in the day during a press conference in Turkey.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is responsible for the United States's policy on refugees,&quot; she said after being pressed a second time to condemn the border tightening.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;table&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm a British citizen &amp; so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear ill be banned from the USA based on my country of birth</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MPs expressed their &quot;heartbreak&quot; at the development last night and called for Mr Trump to urgently overturn the policy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadhim Zahawi, the MP for Stratford-on-Avon who was born in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, said he feared he would be caught up in the ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just think of all the families who will feel like second-class citizens now,&quot; he told the Telegraph.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love the US, I love everything it stands for, but I cannot believe this is happening to British citizens in 2017.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Words cannot describe my sadness. I feel devastated. I would like clarity and a rethink on this. It is a terrible message to the world. I am heartbroken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office, Number 10 and the Home Office all refused to comment when asked about the rule change on Saturday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Government source said: &quot;We are working really closely with the State Department on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest figures show that more than 250,000 people who were born in Iraq, Iran and Somalia have dual British nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No figures are available for those born in Syria, Libya, Sudan or Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was chaos and confusion at airports in the US on Saturday, as customs officials sought to implement the executive order that prevents entry to Syrians indefinitely, all other refugees for four months and bans travellers from seven Middle Eastern countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,&quot; Mr Trump said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. &quot;Don't want them here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a fresh development on Saturday night, a federal judge in Brooklyn put part of the order on hold when he ruled that the US could not deport people after they had landed at US airports with valid visas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as several foreign governments condemned the decision, Mrs May, who has sought to develop close ties with Mr Trump, avoided criticising the president's actions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being asked three times if she condemned the decision to ban families fleeing slaughter in war zones, Mrs May said: &quot;The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers and human rights groups took legal action, filing lawsuits which argued that the orders went against&nbsp;the spirit of the US constitution and the letter of American law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order, which came into force as soon as Mr Trump signed it on Friday afternoon, requires US border officials to turn away any person arriving from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for the next 90 days, whether or not they have a green card.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only a few exceptions for diplomats and dual citizens, the order takes no account of whether travellers have already been issued with visas. The ban will also apply to flight crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing his &quot;extreme vetting&quot; plan, Mr Trump invoked the &nbsp;Sept 11, 2001 attacks. However, most of the 19 plane hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon - all countries not included on the ban list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of the order being signed, chaos broke out at airports around the world as officials sought to understand and interpret the new policies.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Al Rawi, a graduate of California State University and former journalist with the Los Angeles Times, said his father had been hauled off a flight in Qatar as a direct result of Mr Trump's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My 71-year-old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and he's being sent back to Iraq. Some US official told him that Trump cancelled all visas,&quot; he wrote on Facebook hours after the order was signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an Egypt Air flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some airlines have warned that all passengers whose journeys began in any of the seven countries may be affected, even if their own citizenship is not on the &quot;banned&quot; list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian film director nominated for an Oscar won't be able to attend the ceremony in the wake of the orders, it was reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for The Salesman, which tells of a couple whose relationship is thrown into disarray after an intruder surprises her in the shower. &nbsp;Mr Farhadi also won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamaseh Tayari, a UK resident who holds an Iranian passport, who had been on holiday &nbsp;in Costa Rica, found she was unable to board her plane back to Glasgow because her flight went via New York. She found her transit visa had been revoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Tayari, who grew up in Italy and works as a vet in the UK told the Guardian she had &nbsp; never experienced anything like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that this is not just happening to refugees,&quot; she said. &quot;I am a graduate and I have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and who pays tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Zellar, an army captain who runs No One Left Behind, a charity that seeks to bring to the US Afghanis and Iraqis who worked with the American military in their countries, said the bans had caused their programmes to be suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zellar works with people who have been placed on death lists by the Taliban, Isil, or other extremist organisations for the time they spent working with the US military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told The Sunday Telegraph that the process of getting these men and their families into America had always been laborious, sometimes taking them up to five years to obtain a visa. But the executive order was forcing him mostly to suspend the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;Some have been waiting years, moving night by night and living away from their families to escape death squads,&quot; Mr Zellar said. &quot;This closes out their last hope. Heroes and patriots who saved American lives are going to die for their service to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive order includes a potential loophole that says the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a &quot;case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Zellar said repeated efforts to reach the White House to get permission to apply this to former US military employees had failed.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere,&quot; a Google spokesman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Daniel Dale (@ddale8) January 28, 2017Lawyers mount legal challenge to refugee ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's decision to close America's borders to refugees was causing confusion and chaos at airports across the US, as people fleeing war zones were turned away by customs officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ban is now being met with several high profile challenges from lawyers at civil rights organisations who say that the demands made in the  executive order may be illegal .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immigration and Nationality Act, implemented by congress in 1965&nbsp;banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;President Lyndon B&nbsp;Johnson said as he signed the law that &quot;the harsh injustice&quot; of the national-origins quota system had been &quot;abolished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law states that&nbsp;&nbsp;no person could be &quot;discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detentions at airports around the US&nbsp;have&nbsp;prompted legal challenges. The New York Times reported  that lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy Airport filed a writ of habeas corpus early Saturday in the Eastern District of New York seeking to have their clients released. At the same time, they filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Iraqis, Khalid Darweesh, worked for the US government in Iraq for a decade. Whilst the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to the United States to join his wife and young son, the lawyers said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorneys said they were barred from meeting with their clients. When they asked who they needed to talk to to remedy this, a Customs and Border Protection official told them to &quot;call Mr Trump&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the lawyers is from the Refugee Assistance Project. The group said in a statement that the executive order is&nbsp;&quot;irresponsible and dangerous&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation said: &quot;Denying thousands of the most persecuted refugees the chance to reach safety is an irresponsible and dangerous move that undermines American values and imperils our foreign relations and national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IRAP works with hundreds of the most vulnerable refugees - children with medical emergencies, survivors of gender-based violence and torture, and Afghan and Iraqi allies to U.S. forces, to name a few - who will be left in immediate life-threatening danger.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Google spokesperson said:&nbsp;&quot;We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US.&nbsp; We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, wrote in a post on Saturday that he was &quot;concerned&quot; about the impact of the orders and that he would be working with Fwd.US, a charity he supports, to develop protections for child immigrants brought to the US at a young age by their parents.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order signed by Mr Trump also&nbsp;imposes a 120-day suspension the US refugee resettlement programme, regardless of applicants' country of origin, while administration officials develop additional vetting procedures and decide which countries those procedures are &quot;adequate&quot; to ensure safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order suspended a resettlement programme that allowed 85,000 people fleeing war, hunger, and political or religious persecution, to be resettled in the US last year. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Democrats decried the move as &quot;un-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,&quot; said Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May refuses to condemn US refugee ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May&nbsp;refused to condemn Mr Trump's decision when she appeared at a joint press conference with&nbsp;Binali Yildirim, the prime minister of Turkey, following a meeting in Ankara.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Faisal Islam, the political editor of&nbsp;Sky News,&nbsp;whether she viewed it as an &quot;action of the leader of the free world,&quot; the Prime Minister&nbsp;replied that she had been&nbsp;&quot;very pleased&quot; to have met Mr Trump in Washington.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She proceeded to praise Britain's record on refugees, but avoided commenting on US policy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is responsible for the United States policy on refugees,&quot; she said when pressed on the issue a second time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Yildirim, commenting on the same issue,&nbsp;said&nbsp;UN members &quot;cannot turn a blind eye to this issue and settle it by constructing walls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, Germany and Luxembourg also voiced disquiet at the decision. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French Foreign Minister said many of Trump's decisions worried the two U.S. allies, including new immigration restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This can only worry us, but there are many subjects that worry us,&quot; Mr Ayrault said&nbsp;at a joint news conference in Paris with Sigmar Gabriel, his German counterpart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Gabriel said:&nbsp;&quot;The United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbour is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR)&nbsp;and International Organization for Migration (IOM) called on Donald Trump's administration to continue offering asylum to people fleeing war and persecution, saying its resettlement programme was vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the U.S. resettlement programme is one of the most important in the world,&quot; the two Geneva-based agencies said in a joint statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies hoped &quot;that the US will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 25,000 refugees were resettled in the United States between October and year-end under UNHCR's programme for the most vulnerable, the agency said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said it would file a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the executive order on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,&quot; said Lena Masri, the group's director of National Litigation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump on Muslim countriesPosition of athletes including &nbsp;Sir Mo Farah unclear</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The position of high profile British sportsmen born in the countries affected by the visa ban, such as Somali-born Sir Mo Farah and Sudan-born Ajou Deng of the LA Lakers basketball team, remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the State Department the prohibition applies to citizens - or dual nationals - from the seven countries covered by Mr Trump's ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merely being born in the countries would not lead to an immigration ban, the State Department sources confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Sir Mo and Deng live in the United States and should they hold dual nationality, their cases for readmission into the country, were they to depart, &nbsp;would be considered on a case by case basis by the Department of Homeland Security.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also intends to talk to Trump about the success of Canada's refugee policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trudeau reacted to Trump's ban of Muslims from certain countries by tweeting Saturday: &quot;To those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength WelcomeToCanada.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trudeau also posted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport in late 2015. Trudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Trudeau said Trudeau has a message for Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Prime Minister is looking forward to discussing the successes of Canada's immigration and refugee policy with the President when they next speak,&quot; Trudeau spokeswoman Kate Purchase told The Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trudeau is expected to the visit the White House soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister has refrained from criticizing Trump to avoid offending the new president. More than 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green card holders will need additional screening- White House</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House has rowed back from suggesting that green card holders from the countries affected by the ban will automatically be excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. green card holders will require additional screening before they can return to the United States, the White House said on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, a Department of Homeland Security official said people holding green cards, making them legal permanent U.S. residents, were included in President Donald Trump's executive action temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will bar green card holders,&quot; Gillian Christensen, acting Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior White House official later sought to clarify the situation, saying green card holders who had left the United States and wanted to return would have to visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to undergo additional screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You will be allowed to re-enter the United States pending a routine rescreening,&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department said that Britons with dual nationality with the countries Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen will be stopped at the US border for the next 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation, which broke late, sent Downing Street scrambling for a response and has triggered uproar from MPs.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians said tens of thousands of Britons could be caught up in the border chaos as Mr Trump's new immigration rules impact on holidays and business trips.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear whether Theresa May was aware the rules change was going to affect Britons despite spending hours meeting Mr Trump and his top staff in the White House on Friday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May met with President Donald Trump on Friday.Credit:      AP/AP     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department said: &quot;Travelers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or non-immigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period.&nbsp; Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May had refused twice to publicly condemn Mr Trump's ban on refugees from those seven countries earlier in the day during a press conference in Turkey.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is responsible for the United States's policy on refugees,&quot; she said after being pressed a second time to condemn the border tightening.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MPs expressed their &quot;heartbreak&quot; at the development last night and called for Mr Trump to urgently overturn the policy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadhim Zahawi, the MP for Stratford-on-Avon who was born in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, said he feared he would be caught up in the ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just think of all the families who will feel like second class citizens now,&quot; he told The Sunday Telegraph.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love the US, I love everything it stands for, but I cannot believe this is happening to British citizens in 2017.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Words cannot describe my sadness. I feel devastated &nbsp;I would like clarity and a rethink on this. It is a terrible message to the world. I am heartbroken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office, Number 10 and the Home Office all refused to comment when asked about the rule change on Saturday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Government source said simply: &quot;We are working really closely with the State Department on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest figures show that more than 250,000 people have dual British nationality who were born in Iraq, Iran and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No figures are available for those born in Syria, Libya, Sudan or Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was chaos and confusion at airports around America on Saturday, as customs officials sought to implement the executive order that prevents entry to Syrians indefinitely, all other refugees for four months and bans travellers from seven Middle Eastern countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,&quot; the president said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. &quot;Don't want them here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as several foreign governments condemned the decision, Theresa May, the Prime Minister, who has sought to develop close ties with Mr Trump, avoided criticising the president's actions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being asked three times if she condemned the decision to ban families fleeing slaughter in war zones, Mrs May said: &quot;The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers and human rights groups took legal action, filing lawsuits which argued that the orders went against both the spirit of the US constitution and the letter of American law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order, which came into force as soon as Mr Trump signed it on Friday afternoon, requires US border officials to turn away any person arriving from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for the next 90 days, whether or not they have a green card.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only a few exceptions for diplomats and dual citizens, the order takes no account of whether travellers have already been issued with visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing his &quot;extreme vetting&quot; plan, Mr Trump invoked the &nbsp;September 11, 2001 attacks. But most of the 19 plane hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon - all countries not included on the ban list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of the order being signed, chaos broke out at airports around the world as officials sought to understand and interpret the new policies.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Al Rawi, a graduate of California State University and former journalist with the Los Angeles Times, said his father had been hauled off a flight in Qatar as a direct result of Mr Trump's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My 71-year-old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and he's being sent back to Iraq. Some US official told him that Trump cancelled all visas,&quot; he wrote on Facebook hours after the order was signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an Egypt Air flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some airlines have warned that all passengers whose journeys began in any of the seven countries may be affected, even if their own citizenship is not on the &quot;banned&quot; list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian film director nominated for an Oscar won't be able to attend the ceremony in the wake of the orders, it was reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for The Salesman, which tells of a couple whose relationship is thrown into disarray after an intruder surprises her in the shower. &nbsp;Mr Farhadi also won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamaseh Tayari, a UK resident who holds an Iranian passport, who had been on holiday &nbsp;in Costa Rica, found she was unable to board her plane back to Glasgow because her flight went via New York. She found her transit visa had been revoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Tayari, who grew up in Italy and works as a vet in the UK told the Guardian she had &nbsp; never experienced anything like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that this is not just happening to refugees,&quot; she said. &quot;I am a graduate and I have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and who pays tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Zellar, an army captain who runs No One Left Behind, a charity that seeks to bring to the US Afghanis and Iraqis who worked with the American military in their countries, said the bans had caused their programmes to be suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zellar works with people who have been placed on death lists by the Taliban, Isil, or other extremist organisations for the time they spent working with the US military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told The Sunday Telegraph that the process of getting these men and their families into America had always been laborious, sometimes taking them up to five years to obtain a visa. But the executive order was forcing him mostly to suspend the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;Some have been waiting years, moving night by night and living away from their families to escape death squads,&quot; Mr Zellar said. &quot;This closes out their last hope. Heroes and patriots who saved American lives are going to die for their service to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive order includes a potential loophole that says the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a &quot;case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Zellar said repeated efforts to reach the White House to get permission to apply this to former US military employees had failed.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbour is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people,&quot; said Mr Gabriel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany has taken in more than one million refugees and migrants, mainly from the Middle East, since 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg Foreign Minister said Trump's order would have negative consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American president is dividing the Muslim world into good and evil with this,&quot; Mr Asselborn told the Tagesspiegel German newspaper. &quot;The decision is also bad for Europe because it will increase the Muslim world's mistrust and hatred of the West.&quot;</SPAN></P>

According to the Pew Research Center, almost as many Christian refugees (37,521) were admitted as Muslim refugees (38,901) in the 2016 fiscal year.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Daniel Dale (@ddale8) January 28, 2017Lawyers mount legal challenge to refugee ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's decision to close America's borders to refugees was causing confusion and chaos at airports across the US, as people fleeing war zones were turned away by customs officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ban is now being met with several high profile challenges from lawyers at civil rights organisations who say that the demands made in the  executive order may be illegal .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immigration and Nationality Act, implemented by congress in 1965&nbsp;banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;President Lyndon B&nbsp;Johnson said as he signed the law that &quot;the harsh injustice&quot; of the national-origins quota system had been &quot;abolished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law states that&nbsp;&nbsp;no person could be &quot;discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detentions at airports around the US&nbsp;have&nbsp;prompted legal challenges. The New York Times reported  that lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy Airport filed a writ of habeas corpus early Saturday in the Eastern District of New York seeking to have their clients released. At the same time, they filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Iraqis, Khalid Darweesh, worked for the US government in Iraq for a decade. Whilst the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to the United States to join his wife and young son, the lawyers said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorneys said they were barred from meeting with their clients. When they asked who they needed to talk to to remedy this, a Customs and Border Protection official told them to &quot;call Mr Trump&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the lawyers is from the Refugee Assistance Project. The group said in a statement that the executive order is&nbsp;&quot;irresponsible and dangerous&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation said: &quot;Denying thousands of the most persecuted refugees the chance to reach safety is an irresponsible and dangerous move that undermines American values and imperils our foreign relations and national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IRAP works with hundreds of the most vulnerable refugees - children with medical emergencies, survivors of gender-based violence and torture, and Afghan and Iraqi allies to U.S. forces, to name a few - who will be left in immediate life-threatening danger.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also sparked concern in the business world.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google recalled all travelling staff members to the United States following the order amid concern&nbsp;about the possible impact on recruiting top talent abroad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Google spokesperson said:&nbsp;&quot;We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US.&nbsp; We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, wrote in a post on Saturday that he was &quot;concerned&quot; about the impact of the orders and that he would be working with Fwd.US, a charity he supports, to develop protections for child immigrants brought to the US at a young age by their parents.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order signed by Mr Trump also&nbsp;imposes a 120-day suspension the US refugee resettlement programme, regardless of applicants' country of origin, while administration officials develop additional vetting procedures and decide which countries those procedures are &quot;adequate&quot; to ensure safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order suspended a resettlement programme that allowed 85,000 people fleeing war, hunger, and political or religious persecution, to be resettled in the US last year. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Faisal Islam, the political editor of&nbsp;Sky News,&nbsp;whether she viewed it as an &quot;action of the leader of the free world,&quot; the Prime Minister&nbsp;replied that she had been&nbsp;&quot;very pleased&quot; to have met Mr Trump in Washington.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She proceeded to praise Britain's record on refugees, but avoided commenting on US policy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is responsible for the United States policy on refugees,&quot; she said when pressed on the issue a second time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Yildirim, commenting on the same issue,&nbsp;said&nbsp;UN members &quot;cannot turn a blind eye to this issue and settle it by constructing walls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, Germany and Luxembourg also voiced disquiet at the decision. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French Foreign Minister said many of Trump's decisions worried the two U.S. allies, including new immigration restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This can only worry us, but there are many subjects that worry us,&quot; Mr Ayrault said&nbsp;at a joint news conference in Paris with Sigmar Gabriel, his German counterpart.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies hoped &quot;that the US will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 25,000 refugees were resettled in the United States between October and year-end under UNHCR's programme for the most vulnerable, the agency said on Friday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 950 migrants have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean so far this year, according to UN figures, with the unprecedented rate of disasters expected to surpass 2016's record death toll of 5,022.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the Italian coastguard found the use of rubber boats with more passengers packed on board, with no satellite phones and launched at night in bad conditions was increasing the probability of shipwrecks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plight of Syrian children is far more important than politics, but Sturgeon richly deserves to tower over the Prime Minister from the moral high ground, writes Dani Garavelli</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the criticisms frequently levelled at the SNP is that it suffers from a &quot;moral superiority&quot; complex. The idea, promulgated by its opponents, is that the party revels in its image of itself as an ethical cut above, particularly when it comes to immigration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not entirely convinced. But if it's true, then, goodness, isn't the Conservative Party playing into its hands? Nicola Sturgeon may have her flaws; certainly, she is under-performing on education. But set next to Theresa May, she is what Saul Bellow called a &quot;contrast gainer&quot;: someone whose virtues are brought into focus by another's vices. So May's coldness accentuates Sturgeon's compassion; and the UK government's insularity accentuates Holyrood's hearty welcome-to-all.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week was a case in point. On Tuesday, Sturgeon announced the Scottish Government was funding a scheme to retrain Syrian refugee doctors so they could work for the NHS - an inspired idea, given we are experiencing a GP recruitment crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then - like a slap in the face - it emerged May was ending the Dubs scheme to resettle lone child refugees from camps in Europe, less than a year after it had been introduced. The total number given sanctuary in the UK was to be capped at 350 (just over a 10th of the widely anticipated 3,000). Typically, the announcement, which came in the form of a written ministerial statement, was sandwiched between Prime Minister's Questions and the Brexit vote. It was almost as if the party hoped no-one would notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in the current climate - when politics is in the gutter and every day brings some fresh attack on society's weakest - this decision was reprehensible. There are tens of thousands of unaccompanied refugee children stranded in Europe. Only 200 of them have been resettled in the UK under the Dubs scheme so far, with 150 more expected to arrive from Italy and Greece. To call a halt now is to consign some of the world's most vulnerable young people to hunger, disease, rape, persecution, people traffickers and death. It's not as if they're safely accommodated where they are. Already, refugee charities say, children who left the &quot;jungle camp&quot; on the understanding they would be relocated to the UK, are back in Calais, sleeping in woods or under bridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it is the height of naivety to be surprised by the backtracking; after all, it took May long enough to denounce Donald Trump's Muslim ban. And ever since the amendment was passed, the government has been doing its best to evade its responsibilities, drawing out children's suffering by refusing to fast-track their applications, and moving the goalposts on eligibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the government wouldn't even take ownership of its own decision, laying the blame everywhere but at its own door, and coming up with excuses so feeble they were insulting. Home Secretary Amber Rudd claimed the Dubs scheme was &quot;incentivising&quot; children to make perilous journeys to Europe, as if living in a war zone wasn't incentive enough, and tried to pass the buck to local authorities for insisting they lacked the capacity to accommodate them. Given there are 217 councils across the UK - and that 350 works out at less than two children per council - this seemed unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true local authorities are struggling with cuts to funding, and that some claim the &pound;40,000 a year they receive for every unaccompanied child they take is not enough to cover the cost of their care, but it appears little was done to win them over. Eight London council leaders have written an open letter calling on the government to reconsult. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far more credible is the notion that the Home Secretary was reacting to the Daily Mail's hysteria-inducing campaign which claimed many of the unaccompanied refugees who arrived last year were &quot;clearly&quot; over 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scrapping of the scheme has already been criticised by many public figures including the man who moved the amendment, Lord Alf Dubs, a Jewish refugee who came to the UK on the Kindertransport; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby; and even the deputy leader of Ukip, Peter Whittle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May herself is unshameable; even a ticking off from the daughter of the late Nicholas Winton, the man who organised the Kindertransport, didn't seem to give her pause for thought. She was backed up by hard-as-nails Ann Widdicombe who defended the UK's attempt to shirk its obligations on the grounds that the refugee crisis at Calais was all France's fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Tory MPs are uncomfortable. Backbencher Heidi Allen criticised the Home Office's presentation to local councils, saying it could have been &quot;a pitch on pot holes&quot; and insisted the government should not renege on its commitment, while David Burrowes accused Rudd of &quot;trying to cut and run&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth Davidson, however, kept her views to herself. Last week, her Twitter feed was full of RTs on the First Minister's apology over John Mason's claim the IRA could be seen as &quot;freedom fighters&quot;, and a report suggesting Scottish pupils had fallen a year behind in science since the SNP gained power. Both were legitimate lines of attack. Even so: not a single mention of her own party's dereliction of duty over child refugees? Sturgeon, meanwhile, must have been lapping up the flurry of tweets from disaffected English people, hailing Scotland as a bastion of enlightenment and asking if they could move up in the event of a successful indyref2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight against the scrapping of the Dubs scheme is not over. Sturgeon herself has written to May urging her to reverse the &quot;inhumane&quot; decision to cut off a &quot;vital route to safety&quot; for child refugees. Allen has already secured a cross-party debate on the issue later this month, and the charity Help Refugees plans to challenge the decision in the High Court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt they will be accused of sanctimony for taking a stand. But better to be gripped by self-righteousness anger than to lose the capacity to feel anything at all. Better to launch an idealistic defence of human decency, than to surrender to the political nihilism of the post-Trump world. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Carey thinks the Government should do more to help Christians in the Middle East</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord George Carey believes there is &quot;an institutional bias&quot; against Christians fleeing warzones and claims it is easier for Muslim refugees to gain access to UNHCR-run camps and therefore making it difficult for them to be included in schemes that could grant them sanctuary in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is adamant the Government's perceived failures to jump to the aid of Christians in favour of helping Muslims could amount to &quot;unlawful discrimination&quot;, as the Government should be legally obliged to help Christians facing genocide in the Middle East at the hands of groups like Islamic State .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Carey, who published a letter in the Telegraph, said: &quot;It is distressing beyond belief to know the steady 'crucifixion' of Middle East Christians continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Christianity could be 'wiped out' from Iraq - even after ISIS are gone  World's oldest refugee? Woman aged 116 escapes from ISIS </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the run-up to Easter British taxpayers will be appalled by this institutional bias against Christians by politically-correct officials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added Government workers have a &quot;politically-correct phobia of avoiding any risk of being perceived as anti-Muslim&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Archbishop said: &quot;The Muslim victims of the conflict in the Middle East deserve the same compassion as the minority victims. But at the moment they are receiving greater support than the minorities which are targeted by Muslim extremists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yazidi and Christian believers have been ceremonially executed by ISIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christians have been savagely purged in Syria, alongside Yazidis - an ancient religious sect that has seen men ceremonially executed and women sold into sex slavery, as well as several hundred being encircled and left to starve to death in the searing heat by ISIS extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISIS marks Christian homes with the word 'nun', short for Nassarah, meaning Christian, and forced then to leave extremist-held regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 2015, 232 Assyrians were kidnapped in an ISIS attack on Christian farming villages on the banks of the Khabur River in Northeast Syria - 51 were children and 84 women.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Commons passed a resolution saying &quot;Christians, Yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq and Syria are suffering genocide&quot;, but the British Government is yet to officially recognise that position.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Carey added that because most of the refugee camps in the Middle East are &quot;invariably&quot; run by Muslims, it can prevent Christians from getting easy access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The massive aid budget of which the government is rightly proud is being funnelled by the Department for International Development into the UN camps which claim to offer shelter and a potential route to the West for the most needy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet here is the problem. These camps are invariably run by Muslim officials who are often hostile to minorities - especially Muslims who have converted to Christianity. So the refugees who are too scared to enter the camps lose out on both food aid and opportunities to find sanctuary in safer countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Government spokesman said: &quot;UK aid is provided in line with humanitarian principles, so whoever needs our help the most gets it first, regardless of race, gender or religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We work with trusted partners who operate in line with those same principles of neutrality and impartiality, including in practicalities such as refugee camp management and staffing. To suggest otherwise is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And with all of our resettlement schemes we work closely with UNHCR to identify cases that they deem most in need of resettlement according to their established vulnerability criteria.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian refugees from Syria are being discriminated against by the Government, the former Archbishop of Canterbury has said .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Carey claimed that &quot;politically correct&quot; officials were &quot;institutionally biased&quot; against Christian refugees, who are underrepresented in the numbers being moved to the UK.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments came as Russian and American diplomats agreed to restore dialogue over the crisis in Syria following a week of escalating tensions that ended in Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin exchanging barely veiled insults.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rex Tillerson, the US Secretary of State, and Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said both countries would back a UN investigation into last week's deadly poison gas attack in the country's&nbsp;northwestern Idlib province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statements came after marathon talks in Moscow which included a two-hour discussion in which Mr Tillerson tried to persuade Russian president Vladimir Putin to abandon support for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures show that less than 1 per cent of the Syrian refugees resettled under a flagship Government scheme in the third quarter of last year were Christians.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Carey said: &quot;In the run-up to Easter British taxpayers will be appalled by this institutional bias against Christians by politically correct officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this the British government is not just breaking its manifesto pledge to look after Christian refugees, it also appears to be breaking the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His view is supported by&nbsp;a legal opinion from a human rights barrister which&nbsp;suggests that Syrian&nbsp;Christians are subject to &quot;indirect discrimination&quot; under European human rights laws.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christians have been targeted by Isil in Syria alongside other minority groups including Yazidis and Shia Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of these groups have been killed,&nbsp;tortured and driven from their homes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But figures from Christian charity Barnabas Fund show that the Government's Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme, which resettles refugees from Syria, has accepted a tiny number of Christians since September 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the start of the Syrian civil war thousands have fled the countryCredit:      Selcuk Bulent/AP     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just 51 of the 2,592 refugees accepted under the scheme between 7 September 2015 and 30 June 2016 were Christian - less than 2 per cent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proportion dropped to less than 1 per cent for the most recent data obtained by the charity under Freedom of Information laws, which showed that just 13 of the 1,583&nbsp;refugees accepted between July and September last year were Christian.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is despite Christians making up around 10 per cent of the population before the civil war began in 2011.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Lord Carey, minority groups find it more difficult to access the UNHCR camps funded by the Government, which means they are less likely to be included in resettlement schemes which would bring them to the UK.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the Barnabas Fund written in November 2015 suggested that &quot;since the 1980s and 1990s radical Islamist groups have begun to dominate and control refugee camps,&quot; in the Middle East, and that this pattern was also visible in Syrian camps.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing in The Telegraph, Lord Carey, who served as the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1991 to 2002, says that Christians are &quot;disproportionately persecuted&quot; in the Middle East and so should be prioritised for help from the British government. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds that the Government has failed to follow its manifesto commitment to support persecuted Christians in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria war timeline</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His stance was backed by fellow members of the House of Lords.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour peer Lord Anderson of Swansea, former chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said: &quot;The evidence is clear - Christian minorities are being chased out of the Middle East, the birthplace of the Christian faith and the British Government in their aid policies are not responding adequately to this crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a legal opinion human rights lawyer Paul Diamond argues that as Christians have been subject to genocide, the Government is legally obliged to help them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the House of Commons passed a resolution stating that &quot;Christians, Yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq and Syria are suffering genocide&quot;,  though this stance has not been adopted by the British Government.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Government spokesman said: &quot;UK aid is provided in line with humanitarian principles, so whoever needs our help the most gets it first, regardless of race, gender or religion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's executive order to halt travel from seven Muslim-majority countries - Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia - has provoked a wave of concern and condemnation from international leaders and politicians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Angela Merkel said the German chancellor regretted Trump's decision to ban citizens of certain countries from entering the US, adding that she had &quot;explained&quot; the obligations of the Geneva refugee convention to the new president in a phone call on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chancellor regrets the US government's entry ban against refugees and the citizens of certain countries,&quot; Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is convinced that the necessary, decisive battle against terrorism does not justify a general suspicion against people of a certain origin or a certain religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Geneva refugee convention requires the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds. All signatory states are obligated to do. The German government explained this policy in their call yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seibert said the German government would examine what consequences the ban would have for German citizens with dual citizenship, and would &quot;represent their interests, if necessary, before our American partners&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A summary of the phone call between Merkel and Trump, jointly issued to the press on Saturday, had made no mention of the travel ban, emphasising merely the &quot;fundamental significance&quot; of Nato and the intention to &quot;further deepen the already excellent bilateral relations in the coming years&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French president, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, said on Saturday that &quot;when [Trump] rejects the arrival of refugees, while Europe has done its duty, we should respond to him&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollande said that in an unstable and uncertain world, &quot;withdrawal into oneself is a dead-end response&quot;, adding that defending democratic principles required compliance with &quot;the principles on which it is founded, in particular the acceptance of refugees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tweet, Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, said his country was committed to the values that bind Europe: &quot;Open society; plural identity; no discrimination.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the leader of Italy's anti-immigrant Northern League party expressed admiration for Trump's entry ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What Trump's doing on the other side of the ocean, I'd like it done here, too,&quot; said Matteo Salvini. Referring to the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and economic migrants brought to Italy in the last few years after being rescued in the Mediterranean, Salvini said there was &quot;an invasion under way which needs to be blocked&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Charlie Flanagan, said that while US immigration policy was a matter for the US government, &quot;it is clear that the most recent decisions could have far-reaching implications - both on humanitarian grounds and on relations between the US and the global Muslim community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, tweeted : </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada - Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran's foreign minister, Javad Sarif, said Trump's decision would be recorded in history as &quot; a great gift to extremists and their supporters ... Collective discrimination aids terrorist recruitment by deepening faultlines exploited by extremist demagogues to swell their ranks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margot Wallstr&ouml;m, the Swedish foreign affairs minister, said she was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by a decision that &quot;creates mistrust between people&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said the government would continue to work closely with the Trump administration to implement &quot;strong border policies&quot;. She said: &quot;We share a common view on many issues so we will continue to work very closely with the Trump administration,&quot; adding: &quot;The very best days of the Australia-US relationship lie ahead.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's migration crackdown is unnecessary and unethical. The United States has a right to take steps to defend its citizens against terrorism: George W Bush imposed a similar travel ban during the tense months that followed 9-11. But this doesn't meet any obvious strategic challenge. It's the triumph of domestic politics over good sense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's be clear about what Trump's executive order actually does. It's not a blanket Muslim ban. It's a temporary ban on migration from seven terror-prone countries lasting 90 days and a suspension of the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days, until improved vetting can be put in place. The total number of refugees that will be permitted into the country in 2017 is to&nbsp;be capped at 50,000, which is half of the current rate. Many Americans will say that this is reasonable. They're worried about reports of rape and violence following the mass exodus of Syrians to northern Europe, as well as reports of terrorists using refugee routes to enter the EU and attack its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just because Americans are worried about something doesn't make it correct. The facts belie any belief that the US has a refugee problem: it just doesn't take that many people. For instance, America only took around 15,000 Syrians in 2016 - the majority of whom were&nbsp;women and children. Over half were infants. The vetting&nbsp;is rigorous. Only a small percentage&nbsp;of refugees make it through an initial screening, and they are then screened by several security departments in a process that can take up to two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Americans imagine hot-headed young Muslim men queuing up to get on planes bound for a land of milk and honey. But it just ain't true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch | Donald Trump and Theresa May hold hands ahead of joint press conference                         00:56</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Peter Bergen writes, &quot;All the lethal acts of jihadist terrorism in the States since 9/11 have been carried out by American citizens or legal residents, and none of them have been the work of Syrian refugees.&quot; Around a quarter of all attacks have been perpetrated by converts to Islam. Ergo, the link between migration and terrorism is weak, which makes a refugee ban look arbitrary and cruel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The choice of countries affected is pretty random, too. Iran makes the list - even though the incidence of Western, Shia, state-sponsored terrorism is negligible - and yet Afghanistan and Pakistan, both undeniably sources of extremism&nbsp;are excluded. The argument goes that the countries chosen have either governments that back terror or&nbsp;powerful terrorist groups that hold territory there. But that's actually a solid reason to take refugees from those nations - i.e. the refugees are obviously fleeing persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the random nature of the policy and its unclear goals, the administration leaves itself open to the charge of Islamophobia. This is a propaganda coup for the enemy. The Islamic State will be able to point to Trump's words on terrorism and Islam as proof that the &quot;crusader states&quot; are either indifferent to Muslim suffering or actively encouraging it. Moreover, the whiff of Islamophobia will have a detrimental effect upon the lives of US Muslim citizens who, again, fit no easy stereotype. American Muslims are largely middle-class and well educated ; integration has mostly been achieved. As of 2012, there were 3,600 Muslims on active duty in the US military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has made a mistake. Of course, it's arguably what people voted for. But that doesn't make it practicable or right, and moderate Republicans should call a mistake a mistake when they see one being made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department said that Britons with dual nationality with the countries Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen will be stopped at the American border for the next 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation, which broke late on Saturday night, sent Downing Street scrambling for a response and has triggered uproar from MPs.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians said tens of thousands of Britons could be caught up in the border chaos as Mr Trump's new immigration rules impact on holidays and business trips.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear last night whether Theresa May was aware the rules change was going to affect Britons despite spending hours meeting Mr Trump and his top staff in the White House on Friday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May met with President Donald Trump on Friday.Credit:      AP/AP     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department said: &quot;Travelers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or nonimmigrant visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or nonimmigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period.&nbsp; Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May had refused twice to publicly condemn Mr Trump's ban on refugees from those seven countries earlier in the day during a press conference in Turkey.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is responsible for the United States's policy on refugees,&quot; she said after being pressed a second time to condemn the border tightening.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MPs expressed their &quot;heartbreak&quot; at the development last night and called for Mr Trump to urgently overturn the policy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadhim Zahawi, the MP for Stratford-on-Avon who was born in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, said he feared he would be caught up in the ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just think of all the families who will feel like second class citizens now,&quot; he told The Sunday Telegraph.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love the US, I love everything it stands for, but I cannot believe this is happening to British citizens in 2017.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Words cannot describe my sadness. I feel devastated &nbsp;I would like clarity and a rethink on this. It is a terrible message to the world. I am heartbroken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office, Number 10 and the Home Office all refused to comment when asked about the rule change on Saturday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Government source said simply: &quot;We are working really closely with the State Department on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest figures show that more than 250,000 people have dual British nationality who were born in Iraq, Iran and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No figures are available for those born in Syria, Libya, Sudan or Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was chaos and confusion at airports around America on Saturday, as customs officials sought to implement the executive order that prevents entry to Syrians indefinitely, all other refugees for four months and bans travellers from seven Middle Eastern countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,&quot; the president said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. &quot;Don't want them here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as several foreign governments condemned the decision, Theresa May, the Prime Minister, who has sought to develop close ties with Mr Trump, avoided criticising the president's actions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being asked three times if she condemned the decision to ban families fleeing slaughter in war zones, Mrs May said: &quot;The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers and human rights groups took legal action, filing lawsuits which argued that the orders went against both the spirit of the US constitution and the letter of American law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order, which came into force as soon as Mr Trump signed it on Friday afternoon, requires US border officials to turn away any person arriving from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for the next 90 days, whether or not they have a green card.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only a few exceptions for diplomats and dual citizens, the order takes no account of whether travellers have already been issued with visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing his &quot;extreme vetting&quot; plan, Mr Trump invoked the &nbsp;September 11, 2001 attacks. But most of the 19 plane hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon - all countries not included on the ban list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of the order being signed, chaos broke out at airports around the world as officials sought to understand and interpret the new policies.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Al Rawi, a graduate of California State University and former journalist with the Los Angeles Times, said his father had been hauled off a flight in Qatar as a direct result of Mr Trump's decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an Egypt Air flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some airlines have warned that all passengers whose journeys began in any of the seven countries may be affected, even if their own citizenship is not on the &quot;banned&quot; list.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamaseh Tayari, a UK resident who holds an Iranian passport, who had been on holiday &nbsp;in Costa Rica, found she was unable to board her plane back to Glasgow because her flight went via New York. She found her transit visa had been revoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Tayari, who grew up in Italy and works as a vet in the UK told the Guardian she had &nbsp; never experienced anything like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that this is not just happening to refugees,&quot; she said. &quot;I am a graduate and I have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and who pays tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Zellar, an army captain who runs No One Left Behind, a charity that seeks to bring to the US Afghanis and Iraqis who worked with the American military in their countries, said the bans had caused their programmes to be suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zellar works with people who have been placed on death lists by the Taliban, Isil, or other extremist organisations for the time they spent working with the US military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told The Sunday Telegraph that the process of getting these men and their families into America had always been laborious, sometimes taking them up to five years to obtain a visa. But the executive order was forcing him mostly to suspend the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;Some have been waiting years, moving night by night and living away from their families to escape death squads,&quot; Mr Zellar said. &quot;This closes out their last hope. Heroes and patriots who saved American lives are going to die for their service to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive order includes a potential loophole that says the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a &quot;case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Zellar said repeated efforts to reach the White House to get permission to apply this to former US military employees had failed.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere,&quot; a Google spokesman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's decision to close America's borders to refugees was causing confusion and chaos at airports across the US, as people fleeing war zones were turned away by customs officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ban is now being met with several high profile challenges from lawyers at civil rights organisations who say that the demands made in the  executive order may be illegal .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immigration and Nationality Act, implemented by congress in 1965&nbsp;banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;President Lyndon B&nbsp;Johnson said as he signed the law that &quot;the harsh injustice&quot; of the national-origins quota system had been &quot;abolished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law states that&nbsp;&nbsp;no person could be &quot;discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detentions at airports around the US&nbsp;have&nbsp;prompted legal challenges. The New York Times reported  that lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy Airport filed a writ of habeas corpus early Saturday in the Eastern District of New York seeking to have their clients released. At the same time, they filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorneys said they were barred from meeting with their clients. When they asked who they needed to talk to to remedy this, a Customs and Border Protection official told them to &quot;call Mr Trump&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the lawyers is from the Refugee Assistance Project. The group said in a statement that the executive order is&nbsp;&quot;irresponsible and dangerous&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation said: &quot;Denying thousands of the most persecuted refugees the chance to reach safety is an irresponsible and dangerous move that undermines American values and imperils our foreign relations and national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IRAP works with hundreds of the most vulnerable refugees - children with medical emergencies, survivors of gender-based violence and torture, and Afghan and Iraqi allies to U.S. forces, to name a few - who will be left in immediate life-threatening danger.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also sparked concern in the business world.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google recalled all travelling staff members to the United States following the order amid concern&nbsp;about the possible impact on recruiting top talent abroad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Google spokesperson said:&nbsp;&quot;We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US.&nbsp; We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, wrote in a post on Saturday that he was &quot;concerned&quot; about the impact of the orders and that he would be working with Fwd.US, a charity he supports, to develop protections for child immigrants brought to the US at a young age by their parents.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order signed by Mr Trump also&nbsp;imposes a 120-day suspension the US refugee resettlement programme, regardless of applicants' country of origin, while administration officials develop additional vetting procedures and decide which countries those procedures are &quot;adequate&quot; to ensure safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order suspended a resettlement programme that allowed 85,000 people fleeing war, hunger, and political or religious persecution, to be resettled in the US last year. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Democrats decried the move as &quot;un-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,&quot; said Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May refuses to condemn US refugee ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May&nbsp;refused to condemn Mr Trump's decision when she appeared at a joint press conference with&nbsp;Binali Yildirim, the prime minister of Turkey, following a meeting in Ankara.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Faisal Islam, the political editor of&nbsp;Sky News,&nbsp;whether she viewed it as an &quot;action of the leader of the free world,&quot; the Prime Minister&nbsp;replied that she had been&nbsp;&quot;very pleased&quot; to have met Mr Trump in Washington.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She proceeded to praise Britain's record on refugees, but avoided commenting on US policy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is responsible for the United States policy on refugees,&quot; she said when pressed on the issue a second time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Yildirim, commenting on the same issue,&nbsp;said&nbsp;UN members &quot;cannot turn a blind eye to this issue and settle it by constructing walls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, Germany and Luxembourg also voiced disquiet at the decision. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French Foreign Minister said many of Trump's decisions worried the two U.S. allies, including new immigration restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This can only worry us, but there are many subjects that worry us,&quot; Mr Ayrault said&nbsp;at a joint news conference in Paris with Sigmar Gabriel, his German counterpart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Gabriel said:&nbsp;&quot;The United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbour is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR)&nbsp;and International Organization for Migration (IOM) called on Donald Trump's administration to continue offering asylum to people fleeing war and persecution, saying its resettlement programme was vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the U.S. resettlement programme is one of the most important in the world,&quot; the two Geneva-based agencies said in a joint statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies hoped &quot;that the US will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 25,000 refugees were resettled in the United States between October and year-end under UNHCR's programme for the most vulnerable, the agency said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said it would file a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the executive order on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,&quot; said Lena Masri, the group's director of National Litigation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A London synagogue is raising money so it can house a Syrianrefugee family, who are likely to be Muslims, on its premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the South London Liberal Synagogue in Streatham, south London, are hoping to raise &pound;50,000 to convert a former religious studies teaching room into a two-bedroom flat so a family of refugees can move in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alice Alphandary, the synagogue chair, told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the project was proving so popular with the congregation that two architect members had already agreed to work for free on the conversion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It really is lovely,&quot; she said. &quot;It is a project where everybody is pulling together. It's really touched people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Alphandary, 31, whose own father came to Britain from Egypt as a refugee in the 1950s, said her community's awareness of how often Jews had needed to flee persecution or war had played a &quot;massive&quot; part in the enthusiasm for the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Within the Jewish community,&quot; she said, &quot;You get varying levels of religious observance, but so many have got stories ... It really is, if we are not the children of refugees, we might be the grandchildren of refugees. It's such a part of our collective identity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that the Abraham's Tent project - named after the open-sided tent created by Abraham to welcome strangers - will be officially launched on Saturday February 25, the day of Shabbat Shekalim, which commemorates a census of the Jews taken following their Exodus from Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With news of the project spreading online, however, some in the wider Jewish diaspora have appeared critical of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Burd, a presenter at a Jewish radio station in Melbourne, Australia, who has also called &quot;divisive, progressive Democrats&quot; &quot;the new fascists&quot;, left a message on the synagogue's Facebook page claiming: &quot;We in Australia are forced to engage armed guards at our synagogues specifically because of fear of attack from extremist Muslims including Syrian, Palestinian and other Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, due to increased Muslim immigration some of our Jewish day schools and Jewish community centres are in the process of erecting bomb-proof walls in the event of Muslim-related attacks, deranged lone wolves etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jews in London must be very lucky and the only Jews in Europe not living under siege.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Alphandary, however, said she had no such fears about a Syrian, possibly Muslim family living in the converted flat, which will have its own private entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very important to remember that we are talking about human beings,&quot; she said. &quot;There are more things that unite us than divide us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very easy for religion and politics to get confused, and I think it is very important to recognise our common humanity and to help challenge perceptions slightly. We have a good relationship with our local inter-faith communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;If you look at the rhetoric that was in the press maybe 150 years ago when there was a lot of Jewish immigration coming into the country, it's not dissimilar to the language used today towards immigrants and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's also important to distinguish between what is at the heart of a religion and what isn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lambeth, the synagogue's local London borough council, had committed to housing 20 families as part of the Government promise issued under David Cameron to receive 20,000 refugees by 2020. But Ms Aplhandary said the council was finding it difficult to find landlords willing to take in refugees at the local authority housing rate, which was usually well below market rents - especially in areas like Brixton which have in recent years gone from deprived to highly desirable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is thought that so far only six Syrian families have been housed in Lambeth, including a family of six who are now living in a cottage in the grounds of Lambeth Palace, the official residence of Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Alphandary said the Abraham's Tent project therefore represented an opportunity for the synagogue congregation to make a telling contribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;For so many people, it's the chance to make a bit of a difference. It's hard to make great change in life, but if you can just take one small positive action, it's a good place to start.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1018  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rob Lawrie, hailed a hero and a villain, became the human face of Britain's battle over refugees  after trying to smuggle a young Afghan girl to her family in Leeds. One year on, Ruby Kitchen reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Rob Lawrie is in a uniquely powerful position. It's a position he'd rather not be in, but the carpet fitter from Yorkshire, with a move made after barely a moment's thought, became the human face of Britain's battle over child refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a split-second decision, he had agreed in October 2015 to try and smuggle a young Afghan refugee from the Calais Jungle to her family in Leeds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He failed and, caught up in the political storm he had unwittingly created, he was hailed both a hero and a villain by the world's media with his story splashed across every front page. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were death threats, an impending divorce, and the weight of a prison sentence hanging over him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a year on, with a movie in the making, he hopes to use his name to highlight the plight of child refugees such as young Bahar Ahmadi, so that others won't have to go through what she did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't recognise any law that says any child has to live like an animal,&quot; he said, looking back at the day that he agreed to let four-year-old Bahar, whom he called Bru, climb into his van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't recognise any law that tells me it's illegal to help another human being, if that help comes the heart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know what I did. I hold my hands up, I'm guilty. And I'm sorry for my family, but I'm not sorry for the focus it brought to child refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lawrie, in an interview in Saturday's edition of The Yorkshire Post, opened up about the journey which led him to Bru, a young child fleeing the Taliban in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had met her and her father Reze in the Calais Jungle, and, over time, had been begged many times to take the four-year-old to her aunt in Leeds. But it wasn't until October 24, the night of the Red Moon, that he eventually agreed to try. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That night Bru, as she did every night, came and sat on my knee,&quot; the 51-year-old said. &quot;She fell asleep. I looked down and I just thought stuff this'. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was going home that night. It was 10.30pm, and I was on the midnight ferry. I'd be in Leeds by 5am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was getting a little girl out of hell and home to her family. I felt I was doing the right thing. I didn't know I had castaways.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier that day Mr Lawrie had been loading his van with unwanted clothes which could be sold back in England at cash for clothes stores. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group had formed a human chain to load the bags into the back and, unbeknownst to him, two Eritraen men had buried themselves beneath the bags. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were laying under there for all that time,&quot; he said. &quot;How I wasn't done for manslaughter I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it was, he made it to the British border before being stopped. Sniffer dogs caught the scent and, mystified, Mr Lawrie was told to start emptying the back of the van, bag by bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was just trying to be quiet, so I didn't wake Bru,&quot; he said. &quot;In my head I'm begging her not to start crying. And then I pick up a shoe, and I look up, and there's these eyes staring at me. It's a man. Are we in England?' he asks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within another 15 minutes, he's found the other man hiding under the pile of clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was gutted,&quot; he said. &quot;There was no way I would have agreed to take a four year old child to her family in Leeds, and then two random men from Eritrea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lawrie, stunned, was handcuffed and placed under arrest. And he was on his way to the Coquelles Detention Centre. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's when I said you'd better go back. There's a girl in my van. Straight away the alarms started going off, sirens everywhere. It was like I was the devil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days that followed, he could hear the guards whispering &quot;seven to 10 years&quot;, and he knew they were talking about how long he would be sent to jail for. His heart went cold. &quot;I can laugh about it now, but I wasn't then,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in the UK, he was at a loss. He'd been advised to take media coverage into his own hands, rather than risk a free-for-all, so he opened up about what had happened. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his marriage was falling apart. Within three months, he had lost his wife of 14 years. He dropped four stone in weight. The stress of waiting was taking its toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when the time came for his court appearance, while he had one of France's top barristers prepared to act in his defence, he was up against the country's chief prosecutor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warned to expect a sentence of five years in prison or a &pound;20,000 fine, he went in armed with a petition signed by 200,000 people and, with no work and no money, was wearing a &pound;10 suit he had bought from a charity shop in Otley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was Marmite,&quot; he said. &quot;Some people thought I was a horror, others wanted to string me up. I had death threats. Someone spent an awful lot of time detailing in a YouTube video how I should be killed. My worry was my children. I could survive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day of his hearing, the court room was packed. There were journalists from all over the world, TV and documentary crews following his every move. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing, he said, was like something out of a West End Show, with booing and cheers from the gallery and loud dramatic speeches he couldn't understand a word of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it was adjourned, he hid in the bathrooms. And when it was announced that he would only have to pay a fine, to be waived completely if he commits no further offences, he openly wept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just broke,&quot; he said. &quot;I went down. I thought I'd be leaving in handcuffs. I was classed as a smuggler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was penniless. His business was gone, and his marriage was over. But he was allowed to go home. And a year on, he is positive about what the future holds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He volunteers at a local soup kitchen, is in training for the London Marathon, and is in constant demand from charities asking him to give speeches and inspire others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've a new life, he said. &quot;Nothing surprises me now. I was happily married, with a family. Now, I live with my daughter Ruby. But I'm a happy dad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yes, I would consider doing it again. But I would still rather that little girl was living in a house in Leeds with her family than where she is right now.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's Muslim ban could reportedly effect Brits who have dual nationality with countries on the barred list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new US President last night ordered a four-month ban on all refugees entering the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump also said no visas will be issued to nationals from seven mainly-Muslim nations of Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban has sparked outrage among many international organisations and Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement that the State Department is reportedly due to release, seen by The Wall Street Journal, the ban also applies to people originally from one of those countries but who are traveling on a passport issued by any other nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore Iraqis or Syrians wanted to enter the U.S. on a British passport will be barred, according to a U.S. official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British citizens don't normally require a visa to enter the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Travelers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or nonimmigrant visa,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or nonimmigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period. Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech giant Google has reportedly told its overseas staff who could be affected by the rule change to return to the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslim travellers have also started reporting problems getting into America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former journalist with the Los Angeles Times Mohammed Al Rawi said his 71-year-old father had been taken off a flight in Qatar and sent back to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's Muslim ban 'means Iranian film director nominated for an Oscar won't be able to attend ceremony'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing on Facebook, he said: &quot;My 71 year old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and and he's being sent back to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some US official told him that Trump canceled all visas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Corbyn said Trump's ban &quot;should shock and appall us all.&quot;&quot;Theresa May should have stood up for Britain and our values by condemning his actions. It should sadden our country that she chose not to.&quot;After Trump's hideous actions and May's weak failure to condemn them, it's more important than ever for us to say to refugees, seeking a place of safety, that they will always be welcome in Britain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were also reportedly barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York today, sources at Cairo airport said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has also reportedly recalled its staff who are travelling abroad back to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Bloomberg News, a memo to staff says more than 100 of its staff are affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech giant has told these members of staff to return to America, it has been reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has not yet commented on whether staff have been recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian film director nominated for an Oscar may also be unable to attend the prestigious event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated for best foreign language film for his movie The Salesman, which is filmed in Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fans of the renowned filmmaker - who won an Oscar in 2011 for his film A Separation - now fear he will be unable to attend Hollywood's biggest night in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also reports of Syrians who have given up everything who are trapped at US airports and unable to enter the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,&quot; Trump said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump bans ALL refugees from entering the US for four months and Syrian refugees indefinitely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has this morning condemned the ban while civil rights groups have said the order is harmful and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Join the conversation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filmmaker Michael Moore said: &quot;That the President of the United States would order on Holocaust Memorial Day the banning of a people due to their religion is reprehensible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump claimed the move would keep America safer, despite evidence which shows none of the countries on the list have been the source of terror attacks on US soil since 9/11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having given no notice of the ban, it caused chaos for thousands of Arab-American families who already had family members en route to visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were reports of Syrian families who have spent up to two years being vetted for a visa left stranded at the airport having sold all their possessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Trump chose Holocaust Memorial Day to make the announcement was all the more upsetting for many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,&quot; Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton, an Iraq War veteran, said: &quot;President Trump is leading our country out of fear instead of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His executive orders banning refugees and immigrants from some Muslim majority countries to the United States plays right into the hands of our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ISIS has already used his statements to help recruit new suicide bombers, and you can bet Trump's policies will help inspire attacks against Americans both at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His policies literally put our troops' live at risk - I've heard this loud and clear when I have visited them overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also prove he has zero understanding of our country's values and no intention of defending out constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of immigrants, and America is stronger when we welcome the refugees of our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These policies do no not put America first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am ashamed he is our president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a statement: &quot;I am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and father fleeing violence and war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants - the people who helped build your country, ready to work in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am heartbroken that Syrian refugee children, who have suffered through six years of war by no fault of their own, are singled out for discrimination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups have condemned the order as harmful and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Extreme vetting is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,&quot; American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Identifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favoring or discriminating against particular religions,&quot; Romero said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Trump said that Syrian Christians will be given priority when it comes to applying for refugee status, a policy that would likely be challenged on similar grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians,&quot; Trump said in an excerpt of an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, discussing the Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics provided by the Pew Research Center last October do not support Trump's argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pew research found that 38,901 Muslim refugees entered the United States in fiscal year 2016 from all countries, almost the same number, 37,521, as Christian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Legomsky, a former Chief Counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, said prioritising Christians could be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump's move would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a completely plausible prioritisation, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,&quot; Spiro said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order temporarily suspends the United States' main refugee programme which helped around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected to affect two programmes U.S. lawmakers created a few years after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to help the tens of thousands of Iraqis who risked their lives helping Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump says the order is necessary to prevent Islamist militants from coming to the United States posing as refugees, but refugee advocacy groups say the lengthy screening of applicants by multiple U.S. agencies makes this fear unfounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners said Britain should move to step up and help Syrian refugees in the wake of Trump's ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said: &quot; We're appalled that President Trump is closing the door to refugees fleeing terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Restricting America's role in resettlement in the middle of the worst refugee crisis on record will have a huge impact on this vital global programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the world's most vulnerable people will be left struggling to survive in camps and on the borders of conflict zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thankfully we know Britain is better than this. Now is the time to step up and increase our commitment to protect those forced to flee war and persecution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British citizens travelling to America on UK passports will be blocked from entering if they have dual-citizenship with countries targeted in Donald Trump's refugees banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department said that Britons with dual nationality with the countries Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen will be stopped at the American border for the next 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation, which broke late on Saturday night, sent Downing Street scrambling for a response and has triggered uproar from MPs.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians said tens of thousands of Britons could be caught up in the border chaos as Mr Trump's new immigration rules impact on holidays and business trips.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear last night whether Theresa May was aware the rules change was going to affect Britons despite spending hours meeting Mr Trump and his top staff in the White House on Friday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May met with President Donald Trump on Friday.Credit:      AP/AP     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department said: &quot;Travelers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or nonimmigrant visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or nonimmigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period.&nbsp; Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May had refused twice to publicly condemn Mr Trump's ban on refugees from those seven countries earlier in the day during a press conference in Turkey.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is responsible for the United States's policy on refugees,&quot; she said after being pressed a second time to condemn the border tightening.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;table&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm a British citizen &amp; so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear ill be banned from the USA based on my country of birth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Nadhim Zahawi (@nadhimzahawi) January 28, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MPs expressed their &quot;heartbreak&quot; at the development last night and called for Mr Trump to urgently overturn the policy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadhim Zahawi, the MP for Stratford-on-Avon who was born in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, said he feared he would be caught up in the ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just think of all the families who will feel like second class citizens now,&quot; he told The Sunday Telegraph.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love the US, I love everything it stands for, but I cannot believe this is happening to British citizens in 2017.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Words cannot describe my sadness. I feel devastated &nbsp;I would like clarity and a rethink on this. It is a terrible message to the world. I am heartbroken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office, Number 10 and the Home Office all refused to comment when asked about the rule change on Saturday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Government source said simply: &quot;We are working really closely with the State Department on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest figures show that more than 250,000 people have dual British nationality who were born in Iraq, Iran and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No figures are available for those born in Syria, Libya, Sudan or Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was chaos and confusion at airports around America on Saturday, as customs officials sought to implement the executive order that prevents entry to Syrians indefinitely, all other refugees for four months and bans travellers from seven Middle Eastern countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,&quot; the president said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. &quot;Don't want them here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a fresh development on Saturday night a federal judge in Brooklyn put part of the order on hold when he ruled that the US could not deport people after they had landed at US airports with valid visas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - ACLU National (@ACLU) January 29, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as several foreign governments condemned the decision, Theresa May, the Prime Minister, who has sought to develop close ties with Mr Trump, avoided criticising the president's actions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being asked three times if she condemned the decision to ban families fleeing slaughter in war zones, Mrs May said: &quot;The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers and human rights groups took legal action, filing lawsuits which argued that the orders went against both the spirit of the US constitution and the letter of American law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order, which came into force as soon as Mr Trump signed it on Friday afternoon, requires US border officials to turn away any person arriving from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for the next 90 days, whether or not they have a green card.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only a few exceptions for diplomats and dual citizens, the order takes no account of whether travellers have already been issued with visas. The ban will also apply to flight crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing his &quot;extreme vetting&quot; plan, Mr Trump invoked the &nbsp;September 11, 2001 attacks. But most of the 19 plane hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon - all countries not included on the ban list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of the order being signed, chaos broke out at airports around the world as officials sought to understand and interpret the new policies.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Al Rawi, a graduate of California State University and former journalist with the Los Angeles Times, said his father had been hauled off a flight in Qatar as a direct result of Mr Trump's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My 71-year-old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and he's being sent back to Iraq. Some US official told him that Trump cancelled all visas,&quot; he wrote on Facebook hours after the order was signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an Egypt Air flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some airlines have warned that all passengers whose journeys began in any of the seven countries may be affected, even if their own citizenship is not on the &quot;banned&quot; list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian film director nominated for an Oscar won't be able to attend the ceremony in the wake of the orders, it was reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for The Salesman, which tells of a couple whose relationship is thrown into disarray after an intruder surprises her in the shower. &nbsp;Mr Farhadi also won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamaseh Tayari, a UK resident who holds an Iranian passport, who had been on holiday &nbsp;in Costa Rica, found she was unable to board her plane back to Glasgow because her flight went via New York. She found her transit visa had been revoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Tayari, who grew up in Italy and works as a vet in the UK told the Guardian she had &nbsp; never experienced anything like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know that this is not just happening to refugees,&quot; she said. &quot;I am a graduate and I have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and who pays tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Zellar, an army captain who runs No One Left Behind, a charity that seeks to bring to the US Afghanis and Iraqis who worked with the American military in their countries, said the bans had caused their programmes to be suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zellar works with people who have been placed on death lists by the Taliban, Isil, or other extremist organisations for the time they spent working with the US military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told The Sunday Telegraph that the process of getting these men and their families into America had always been laborious, sometimes taking them up to five years to obtain a visa. But the executive order was forcing him mostly to suspend the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;Some have been waiting years, moving night by night and living away from their families to escape death squads,&quot; Mr Zellar said. &quot;This closes out their last hope. Heroes and patriots who saved American lives are going to die for their service to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive order includes a potential loophole that says the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a &quot;case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Zellar said repeated efforts to reach the White House to get permission to apply this to former US military employees had failed.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also sparked concern in the business world. Google recalled all travelling staff members to the US following the order, and warned of the possible impact on recruiting top talent abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere,&quot; a Google spokesman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's decision to close America's borders to refugees was causing confusion and chaos at airports across the US, as people fleeing war zones were turned away by customs officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ban is now being met with several high profile challenges from lawyers at civil rights organisations who say that the demands made in the  executive order may be illegal .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immigration and Nationality Act, implemented by congress in 1965&nbsp;banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;President Lyndon B&nbsp;Johnson said as he signed the law that &quot;the harsh injustice&quot; of the national-origins quota system had been &quot;abolished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law states that&nbsp;&nbsp;no person could be &quot;discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detentions at airports around the US&nbsp;have&nbsp;prompted legal challenges. The New York Times reported  that lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy Airport filed a writ of habeas corpus early Saturday in the Eastern District of New York seeking to have their clients released. At the same time, they filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump will visit the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday where it is thought he will order federal funds to be allocated towards the building of a wall, one of his signature campaign promises, along America's southern border with Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump tweeted on Tuesday night:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        &lt;table&gt;                                                                           </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017                                                                                  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also expected to order a multi-month ban on allowing refugees into the United States except for religious minorities escaping persecution, until more aggressive vetting is in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another order will block visas being issued to anyone from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the unnamed aides and experts told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly stated he would build the wall with Mexico to combat &quot;drug dealers, criminals and rapists&quot; and, in the wake of the San Bernadino terror attack, proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, said on Tuesday: &quot;First and foremost, the President's been very, very clear that we need to direct agencies to focus on those who are in this country illegally and have a record - a criminal record or poses a threat to the American people. That's where the priorities going to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detractors could launch legal challenges to the moves if all the countries subject to the ban are Muslim-majority nations, said immigration expert Hiroshi Motomura at UCLA School of Law. Legal arguments could claim the executive orders discriminate against a particular religion, which would be unconstitutional, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His comments during the campaign and a number of people on his team focused very much on religion as the target,&quot; Mr Motomura said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Legomsky, who was chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, said the president had the authority to limit refugee admissions and the issuance of visas to specific countries if the administration determined it was in the public&acirc;(EURO)(TM)s interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From a legal standpoint, it would be exactly within his legal rights,&quot; said Legomsky, a professor at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis. &quot;But from a policy standpoint, it would be terrible idea because there is such an urgent humanitarian need right now for refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican president, who took office last Friday, was expected to sign the first of the orders at the Department of Homeland Security, whose responsibilities include immigration and border security.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer took the first question at his briefing on Tuesday from a reporter who works for LifeZette, a website founded by Donald Trump supporter Laura Ingraham that published some untrue stories during the 2016 presidential campaign, AP reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, LifeZette released a video, &quot;Clinton Body Count,&quot; that promoted a conspiracy theory that Hillary and Bill Clinton had ties to the deaths of several colleagues and Democrats. Another video posted two weeks before the election promoted false claims that voting machines in 16 states could be compromised because they were linked to a company tied to liberal activist George Soros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Spicer takes questions at the White House briefingCredit:      Getty     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LifeZette features a mix of conservative politics, lifestyle and consumer articles and videos. Its home page Tuesday featured a story about New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady calling Trump to congratulate him on becoming president; one that questioned the purpose of last weekend's women's march; and another in which Fox News' Sean Hannity condemned Trump officials who had leaked information to the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's briefing was another indication of how press relations have changed with the onset of a new administration in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spicer taking the first question from Stinson attracted notice because, before Trump, major news outlets were traditionally called upon to open White House press conferences and briefings.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wycombe Abbey may well be the best school in the country. When it comes to exam results, the independent girls' school knocks the boys into a straw boater. In November, as it became clear that Donald Trump would be the next President of the United States, shrieks and wails were heard coming from the boarding houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girls were aghast. Many were in tears. It wasn't just that there would be no first female president, not now and maybe not in their lifetime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instinctively, the girls understood that Trump's victory was a personal insult. What does it matter if you are a bright young woman, immensely hard-working and convinced you are the equal of any boy, when the most powerful man on earth believes his celebrity gives him the right to grab you by the private parts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I was swept forward on a great tide of people during the Women's March on Saturday, it was the girls of Wycombe Abbey I was thinking of.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures were revealed asthe Home Office admitted that an &quot;administrative error&quot; led to 130 places for child refugees offered by local councils not being taken into consideration as part of the Dubs Amendment scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners said this highlighted the &quot;chaotic system&quot; the Government had adopted in the safeguarding of unaccompanied minors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The offers from councils were made in response to the creation of the National Transfer Scheme in July last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme was designed to take unaccompanied children from areas such as Kent and Croydon, which were supporting disproportionately large numbersand relocate them to other areas of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than four out of five of the 80 per cent of councils that responded to </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freedom of Information requests said they had signed up to the scheme, and half said they had made a commitment to support the equivalent to 0.07 per cent of their total child population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fewer than one in five had declined to accept any children at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has maintained that the scheme is voluntary, despite the fact that the Immigration Act 2016 gave it powers to make the scheme mandatory, which would enable the UK to help many more refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK refused entry to 130 child refugees due to administrative mistake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the figures, Debbie Beadle, head of youth development at ECPAT, a leading children's rights organisation in the UK campaigning against child trafficking, said the Government's dismissal of places offered was &quot;disappointing&quot;, warning that it would be driving vulnerable children into the hands of traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is disappointing. These children are some of the most vulnerable in our societyand they're not being accommodated and supported appropriately, which is leaving them at risk of trafficking and exploitation,&quot; Ms Beadle told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're leaving them in very vulnerable positions. In the UK we have a Children's Act which is meant to be in place to safeguard all children no matter what their status or where they're from, and in this case we're failing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kids are being picked up by people with other ideas. It leads children into the hands of traffickers and other dangerous people who are going to abuse them. They don't see any hope the other way when they get a negative response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Dubs also told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;For some time we've been telling the Home Office that local authorities all the way from London to Scotland are willing to take more unaccompanied asylum seeking children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain 'could have taken 1,300 more child refugees, not just 130'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why these offers had been ignored, he said: &quot;It beats me. We're talking about an important point of principle. We're not talking about vast numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Jonathan Clark, chairman of Citizens UK Safe Passage programme, meanwhile said: &quot;This research reflects what we are hearing from Refugees Welcome groups across the UK: that many councils have space to take more child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We call on the government to look again at its decision to close the 'Dubs scheme' and re-consult with councils on capacity so more children can in future benefit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has already been speculation about the Home Office's dismissal of council offers. Britain's largest fostering and adoption charity, Tact Care, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last month that the UK had capacity to take in at least 1,300 more child refugees - 10 times more than the 130 the Home Office had specified - but that it was adopting a &quot;chaotic system&quot; that was leaving places unaccounted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy Elvin, chief executive of the charity, said: &quot;The Home Office is spouting continuous lies. There is room for at least 1,300 children in the UK, but due to a chaotic system many places are going unaccounted for. They didn't have an organised process of asking local authorities how many places they could offer Dubs children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government announced in early February that it was to close the Dubs scheme - intended to grant 3,000 vulnerable unaccompanied minors a safe passage to Britain - after accepting just 350, as well as ending an accelerated scheme to assess direct family ties through the Dublin regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following anger from human rights campaigners, the Home Office has since said it would reconsider cases of children &quot;normally resident in the Calais camp&quot; for family reunification, but this process is said to be &quot;very slow&quot; and does not apply to vulnerable minors without family in the UK, prompting a growing number to turn to illegal routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of underage refugees northern France is meanwhile steadily increasing, which charities and campaigners have warned is generating a new &quot;consumer base&quot; for smugglers and people traffickers in the region, as they coerce children into taking illegal routes involving large debts or exploitation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartlett's submission described self-harm as &quot;rife&quot; among both the refugee and asylum seeker populations, although she limited her report to those she worked with - the cohort of refugees settled in Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many incidents had stuck in her mind, she said, including a suicide attempt in July by a young child who sought to drown in the ocean. According to Bartlett, one man reported returning to his accommodation module to find his pregnant wife covered in petrol with a lighter in her hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartlett's submission, which does not contain names, said after one refugee's self-immolation, about 50 other people threatened or attempted to set themselves on fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month after she arrived a 23-year-old Iranian refugee living in Nauru, Omid Masoumali, died after he set himself on fire in front of visiting UN officials. His wife, Pari, was brought to Australia and is still being held in isolated detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than a week after Masoumali's death a Somali woman, Hodan Yasin, also set herself alight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those who attempted to self-immolate in the following months were stopped by family or authorities, and one man was arrested, Bartlett said. One woman was saved by a security officer who ran into a burning building which she had set alight while inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Death in detention: 'I'd give everything to have him back'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another woman who said she had been sexually assaulted by a staff member told CSS she had covered herself in petrol and lay in bed considering setting it alight, before changing her mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of assaults on refugees - and sometimes on staff - by Nauruan men occurred on &quot;almost a daily basis&quot;, Bartlett said, and she believed they contributed to the self-harm and suicide attempts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police investigations were inadequate and in at least one instance inappropriate and re-traumatising for the victim, she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartlett said a lack of opportunity and autonomy, and a sense of hopelessness contributed to the high levels of self-harm, as well as medical concerns, with refugees facing difficulties obtaining their medical records or even getting ambulances to turn up when called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not uncommon for refugees on Nauru to state 'I am not an animal' or 'we are not animals',&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that years of having no control over their lives or their choices, being spoken down to and feeling like they are seen as lesser people has had a profound impact on the mental health of many of the refugees on Nauru.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartlett also described a &quot;culture of secrecy, mistrust and uncertainty&quot; at CSS, which she put down to the effect of the Border Force Act's disclosure provisions. Staff had a fear of being investigated and this led to a lack of accountability, she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incident reports written by CSS staff for at least few months from March 2016 required reviews and edits before going to the Australian Border Force, she said, and it was &quot;not unusual&quot; to see a report changed so it no longer painted stakeholders negatively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartlett told Guardian Australia she had wanted her submission to be made available to the public as she would not be allowed to discuss its contents under the Border Force Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under its provisions, workers from Australia's offshore detention centres can be jailed for up to two years for speaking publicly about conditions within the centres or the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. Submissions to Senate inquiries attract parliamentary privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Immigration and Border Protection told the inquiry it had identified some of the cases Bartlett described and was satisfied the appropriate response and support had been provided, including referrals to police. A number of cases it was unable to identify and could not comment on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Children are being damaged in detention - Australia's day of reckoning will come | Katie Robertson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department also detailed at length the support it provides the Nauruan government and police force, and improvements made to facilities. It did not address Bartlett's concerns about the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its responding submission the processing centres' health contractor, International Health and Medical Services dismissed Bartlett's submission as unrepresentative, saying her rotations fell during a &quot;period of extreme unrest&quot; and were not representative of &quot;a longitudinal picture of issues across the entire population&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IHMS said there had been a period of difficulty in providing medical records while negotiations were under way with the Royal Nauru hospital but that had been cleared up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate inquiry's majority report called for the government to end the &quot;fiction&quot; that it did not control the two immigration centres and had no duty of care to their occupants, and said the immigration department had clearly failed to deliver policy in a transparent and safe manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We call on the Government to stand firm in its public commitment to offer protection to vulnerable children displaced by the conflicts at Europe's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every day we see the generous spirit of Londoners as our volunteers stand alongside young people who have found safety here; young people such as 17-year-old Hussein, who fled Syria after his family was killed, and Mustafa, 16, who escaped the conflict in Iraq and journeyed to Europe alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through weekly educational mentoring our volunteers show teenagers such as Hussein and Mustafa that their futures are worth investing in. In turn, these volunteers tell us that the perseverance, humour and humility of these young people inspire them to value the fundamental human rights that we take for granted in our society, such as safety, education and healthcare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With these rights in mind we call on the Government to keep taking responsibility for the safety of unaccompanied migrant children under the Dubs Amendment scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emily Bowerman, Refugee Support Network</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the criticism the Government has experienced since it announced that the Dubs amendment scheme would end later this year, it is worth remembering that the whole idea of the scheme is to give child refugees a secure and safe environment in which to grow up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, reviewing foster care statistics released by the Home Office in December 2014, the outcomes for these refugee children don't appear to be favourable. They show that nationally while 75 per cent of children achieved five or more good GCSEs (A* to C), for children in foster care the figure was 31 per cent; one per cent of 10- to 17-year-olds were reprimanded but for foster children it was six per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians and social care experts who are criticising the Government should be asked to justify how taking in these vulnerable children and putting them in an alien environment with poor outcomes is considered to be best for their welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All options to help these children must be considered rather than simply assuming that UK social care is the best option .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Balfe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to thank the few Conservative MPs who demonstrated their humanity by pressing Theresa May to accept more lone child refugees into the UK [&quot;Tories press May to take more lone child refugees&quot;, February 10].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These children have experienced unimaginable dangerous journeys and the doors should not be shut on them. The UK has developed a good reputation for helping vulnerable refugees in the past - let's not throw it away now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Handsen Chikowore</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No need for EU to be sour over Brexit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see once again more nastiness and innuendo from EU officials as per your report [&quot;EU chief: Brexit could get nasty and don't expect quick trade deal&quot;, February 10].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since the referendum the UK has been trying to set out its objectives. Theresa May says she wants a deal that is mutually beneficial to both Britain and the EU yet the European Parliament, European Commission and now its office in London are making vindictive comments - the same kind of anti-British rhetoric and Anglophobic overtures that resulted in my decision to vote Leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said that, they didn't do anything during the campaign to help the Remain camp. Yet look at how many English politicians went to Scotland to campaign for Scots to reject the offer of independence - and it made a considerable difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never mind the predicted economic repercussions; if the EU can't stomach making positive overtures to the British, it just shows how right we were to vote Leave.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Lenin's testament' proves the truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those familiar with Russian history may disagree with Victor Sebestyen's article [&quot;Russia's revolutionary artists were betrayed by their new leaders&quot;, Comment, February 10].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He writes that Vladimir Lenin &quot;built a system based on the idea that political terror against opponents was justified for a greater end&quot;. The Red Terror, conducted by the Bolsheviks, was formed in response to the White Army - led by Admiral Alexander Kolchak, General Lavr Kornilov and later General Anton Denikin - which was supported by France and Britain. Both sides committed brutal atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between December 1922 and January 1923, Lenin, who was ill, dictated a letter known as &quot;Lenin's testament&quot;, recommending that Stalin be removed from the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party. Therefore, to say that it was a &quot;historic crime&quot; of Lenin to leave Stalin in a position to lead Russia is simply untrue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Test captain Root brings hope</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is often said that a captain should lead by example - and no England batsman is as consistent at the crease than Joe Root. Since he made his Test debut in 2012, no player has hit more runs for England than Root. At 26, he has 53 caps to his name and has shown real signs of maturity when playing for his country. Appointing a young captain means there is an opportunity for a fresh start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not to say that Alastair Cook's tenure was unsuccessful. However, after the humiliating 4-0 Test defeat by India, he will know that the time was right for him to step down. Now he can step out of the limelight and concentrate on his career rather than England's performance as a team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time when England were the best side in Test cricket. I hope that under Root, those days can return sooner rather than later.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerning the Mayor's intention to ban diesel vehicles, there is no doubt they contribute to London's bad air. However, pollution created by traffic in Hyde Park, where Boris Johnson's cycle lane has restricted all vehicles to two lanes, has to be experienced to be believed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Mayor wishes to reduce pollution, perhaps he should consider removing this cycle lane to allow traffic to flow again?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRIME Minister Theresa May found herself into a fresh row with the Church over her treatment of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She insisted the Government's approach to assisting them is &quot;absolutely right&quot;, after the Archbishop of Canterbury added his voice to a chorus of protest over the decision to close a scheme for unaccompanied children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Most Rev Justin Welby, the former Bishop of Durham, said he was &quot;saddened and shocked&quot; at the Government's decision to limit to 350 the number of children who will be allowed into the UK under the scheme, introduced last year under the so-called Dubs Amendment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archbishop said he had believed ministers were &quot;committed to welcoming up to 3,000 children under this scheme&quot; and it is &quot;regrettable&quot; that such a small proportion have been given sanctuary in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His intervention piles further pressure on the Government, which has been heavily criticised by Lords and MPs in Parliament after it quietly announced the cap on the scheme, designed for refugee children stranded in Europe without their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a press conference in Downing Street following talks with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Mrs May said the Dubs scheme was only one of a number of routes by which vulnerable children from war-torn Syria can find sanctuary in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister said: &quot;We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right, on top of course of the significant financial support and humanitarian aid we are giving to refugees in the region of Syria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement calling on ministers to reverse their decision, the Archbishop said refugees were &quot;treasured human beings made in the image of God who deserve safety, freedom and the opportunity to flourish&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government's decision to take in vulnerable children under the mechanism proposed by Labour peer Lord Dubs, himself a wartime refugee from Nazism, was &quot;the right thing to do&quot; and showed the UK's leadership in responding to the migration crisis, said Mr Welby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added: &quot;I fear that this week's decision does not meet the spirit of commitment that was given during the passage of the Immigration Act last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs and peers PM Theresa May who backed the Dubs amendment did so on the understanding the Government was committed to welcoming up to 3,000 children, said the Archbishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To end the scheme now, when such a small proportion have actually entered the country, is regrettable,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local authorities, who are bearing the costs of the resettlement, must be given the resources and time needed to meet our original commitment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in comments which could be interpreted as a swipe at US President Donald Trump, the Archbishop warned against a growing intolerance of refugees around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must resist and turn back the worrying trends we are seeing under fire around the world, towards seeing the movement of desperate people as more of a threat to identity and security than an opportunity to do our duty,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I very much hope that the Government will reconsider this decision, and work with church groups and others to find a sustainable and compassionate solution that allows those most in need to find sanctuary in our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers introduced the scheme to give a home to lone children stranded on the continent last year after being threatened with a rebellion in the House of Lords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Government insists it was never committed to the 3,000 number, and said local councils across the UK have indicated between them they can provide the necessary care and assistance to no more than 350 unaccompanied child migrants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours before the final vote on the triggering of Article 50 the Government quietly announced it would allow just 350 unaccompanied Syrian children to come to the UK, thousands short of the figure suggested by government sources last year. The statement from Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill said local authorities indicated they &quot;have capacity for around 400 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children until the end of this financial year&quot; and said the country should be &quot;proud&quot; of its contribution to finding homes for refugees. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called the decision &quot;a betrayal of British values&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last May, MPs from all parties condemned the Government's inaction on child refugees in Europe, and voted overwhelmingly to offer help to the thousands of unaccompanied kids who were stranded without their families backed by huge public support,&quot; Mr Farron said. &quot;Instead, the Government has done the bare minimum, helping only a tiny number of youngsters and appearing to end the programme while thousands still suffer. At the end of December last year the Government had failed to bring a single child refugee to the UK under the Dubs scheme from Greece or Italy where many of these children are trapped.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers introduced the programme last year after coming under intense pressure to give sanctuary to lone children stranded on the continent. Calls for the measure were spearheaded by Lord Alfred Dubs, whose amendment to the Immigration Act requires the Government to &quot;make arrangements to relocate to the UK and support a specified number of unaccompanied refugee children from other countries in Europe&quot;. The legislation did not specify a figure but on Wednesday Mr Goodwill said 350 children will be transferred under the initiative. It is the first time an official figure has been given for the number of under-18s who will be resettled in the UK under the Dubs Amendment, which is given effect by Section 67 of the Immigration Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judith Dennis, Policy Manager at the Refugee Council said: &quot;The Government's job is far from done; the global refugee crisis hasn't gone away and if anything it's getting worse. The UK needs to step up rather than step back and ensure that we pull our weight by offering refuge to more vulnerable people and enabling more refugees to reunite with their families here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was reached after consultation with councils on their capacity to care for and support asylum-seeking children, the Government said. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Goodwill said more than 900 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children were transferred to the UK from Europe in total last year. This included more than 750 from France as part of Britain's support for the clearance of the Calais jungle. More than 200 of those children met the criteria for the Dubs route, while the remainder were transferred under an accelerated process based on, but operated outside of, the Dublin Regulation covering family reunion cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Goodwill said: &quot;The UK can be proud of its record of helping refugee children and I can today announce, in accordance with Section 67 of the Immigration Act, that the Government will transfer the specified number of 350 children pursuant to that section, who reasonably meet the intention and spirit behind the provision. This number includes over 200 children already transferred under Section 67 from France. It does not include children transferred to UK where they have close family here. We will announce in due course the basis on which further children will be transferred from Europe to the UK under Section 67 of the Immigration Act to the specified number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office minister added: &quot;As required by the legislation, we have consulted with local authorities on their capacity to care for and support unaccompanied asylum-seeking children before arriving at this number. Local authorities told us they have capacity for around 400 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children until the end of this financial year. We estimate that at least 50 of the family reunion cases transferred from France as part of the Calais clearance will require a local authority placement in cases where the family reunion does not work out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are grateful for the way in which local authorities have stepped up to provide places for those arriving and we will continue to work closely to address capacity needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull refused to comment on the details of the phone conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. President Donald Trump says he loves Australia and will 'respect' the asylum-seeker deal for refugees held on Manus Island and Nauru after a diplomatic crisis erupted when details of his phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were revealed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Trump, before a meeting with US steelworkers at the White House on Thursday, blasted the deal negotiated by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last year with former U.S. president Barack Obama.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have a lot of respect for Australia,' Mr Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I love Australia as a country but I have a problem where for whatever reason President Obama said they were going to take probably well over 1000 illegal immigrants who were in prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'1250, could be 2000, could be more than that and I said 'Why? Why are we doing this?'.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Sean Spicer said refugees will only be allowed in the U.S. if they pass extreme vetting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Mr Trump continued his public stoush with Mr Turnbull by declaring he needs to make 'tough phone calls' because nations are taking advantage of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diplomatic crisis erupted after the contents of the first telephone call between Donald&nbsp; Trump  and&nbsp; Malcolm Turnbull  over a deal signed off by Barack Obama to take 1,250 asylum seekers from Manus and Nauru were revealed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump accused Malcolm Turnbull of trying to send the 'next Boston bombers' to the United States during their first official telephone conversation.&nbsp;Senior US officials told the Washington Post &nbsp;that Donald Trump abruptly ended the conversation with Mr Turnbull after just 25 minutes - when the pair were meant to speak for an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then on Thursday, the President took to&nbsp;Twitter to slam the Obama administration for agreeing to take on the refugees in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!,' he wrote.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a morning speech in Washington DC, Mr Trump said the world was in trouble but he was 'going to straighten it out'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it,' Mr Trump told the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Just don't worry about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They're tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have to be tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's time we have to be a little tough folks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's not going to happen anymore.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post revealed on Wednesday a weekend call between Mr Trump and Mr Turnbull had ended abruptly.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr Turnbull has denied Mr Trump hung up on him, telling 2GB's Ben Fordham: 'As far as the call is concerned, I'm very disappointed, the report the president hung up is not correct, the call ended courteously.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Malcolm Turnbull's colleagues are praising the prime minister for putting Australia first and pushing for the US refugee deal during his hostile call with Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabinet minister Christopher Pyne is insistent the arrangement struck with the Obama administration to take asylum seekers from Nauru and Manus Island still stands, despite Mr Trump labelling it the worst deal ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Malcolm Turnbull stood up to it and the reality is Australia's interests are being put first,' he said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the details of the telephone call, a fuming President Trump told Mr Turnbull that the conversation was 'the worst call by far' he had taken that day, after 'boasting' about pleasant exchanges with Russian President Vladimir Putin and three other world leaders.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump ranted about the deal the Obama administration's deal to take 1250 genuine refugees from Nauru and Manus Island, telling Mr Turnbull: 'I don't want these people'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the 'worst deal ever', he told the prime minister, complaining he was 'going to get killed' politically for following through on the resettlement agreement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News sources claim President Trump was 'yelling' at Mr Turnbull at points during the heated conversation, which took place on Saturday afternoon Washington time, Sunday morning Australian time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT IS THE AUSTRALIA-US REFUGEE DEAL?                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration and Turnbull government struck a deal to resettle some of the refugees being held offshore in Nauru and Manus Island in November last year&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has a 'zero tolerance' policy towards illegal boat arrivals and only genuine refugees are sent to Nauru and Manus Island&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are approximately 1,250 refugees being held in the Australian-funded offshore detention centres</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large majority of those refugees come from Iran, Iraq and Somalia - all countries on US President Donald Trump's travel-ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump reportedly agreed to honour the deal, on the condition the refugees would undergo 'extreme vetting'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US President reportedly described it as the 'worst deal ever' in a heated conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump indicated he was sceptical about what America got out of honouring the deal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr Turnbull apparently suggested they move on and talk about foreign affairs, including the conflict in Syria, President Trump ended the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'During call with Australian PM on refugees, Trump pulled phone away from ear and says he wants off call, which ends abruptly per source,' CNN reporter Jim Acosta tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement reached with the Obama administration, Australian would take a number of South American refugees, currently in a processing center in Costa Rica, in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These refugees are predominantly Christian, according to reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to revelations of the hostile phone conversation, Mr Turnbull remained tight-lipped on Thursday and said that he wasn't going to comment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's better that these things - these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News reporter Laura Jayes said Australian government sources who took part in discussions after the call said Mr Turnbull viewed the president as a 'bully'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What I derived from that was Malcolm Turnbull used this phone call to push back,' Ms Jayes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He wasn't just sitting there being berated by Donald Trump, he talked about how important it was for (Trump) to honour the deal.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosive report is a huge embarrassment for Mr Turnbull, who has insisted in recent days the asylum seeker deal is solid and relations with Washington are fine.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and Australia have been close military and economic allies for generations, with Australian troops fighting alongside Americans in every military conflict Washington has been involved in since World War II.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is one of just four other countries the US shares security intelligence with under the Five Eyes alliance. The two countries have also shared a free trade agreement since 2005.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official statement about the phone call released by the White House told a different story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Both leaders emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally,' it said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull on Monday described the call as constructive, saying the pair acknowledged the already strong and deep relationship between the US and Australia and committed to making it stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That's my job. My job is to defend the national interest of Australia and defend the interests of Australians,' he told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You may wish to speculate about policies and politics in Washington, that's not my role. My job is today and everyday to stand up for Australia and that's what I do.&nbsp;'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also thanked the president for 'committing' to honour the refugee agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1.30pm (AEDT) on Thursday the US Embassy in Australia released a statement that the deal would go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'President Trump's decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed and Spokesman Spicer's comments stand,' a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this Embassy at 13:15 Canberra time.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it came after a morning of mixed messages from various official sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday it was reported that the White House had backtracked on the asylum seeker deal, saying that President Trump was still considering it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said the deal had not been confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if it were to go ahead, it would only be because of the United States' 'longstanding relationship with Australia,'&nbsp; The ABC  reported.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         'CRUEL, INHUMAN AND DEGRADING': UN HITS OUT OVER 'OPEN-AIR PRISON'                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has been heavily criticized by the UN for its policy of sending migrants to offshore detention centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November UN investigator Francois Crepeau visited the island of Nauru, where asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent, and described conditions as 'cruel, inhuman and degrading'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Crepeau said Australia's policies 'have increasingly eroded the human rights of migrants in contravention of its international human rights and humanitarian obligations'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he continued: 'Australia would vehemently protest if its citizens were treated like this by other counties and especially if Australian children were treated like this.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International said in October that the immigration center was an 'open-air prison'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes just one day after Mr Spicer told reporters Mr Trump would honour the 'one-off' deal with former President Barack Obama in November to resettle refugees detained on Manus and Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Part of the deal is they have to be vetted in the same manner that we are doing now.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Mr Trump placed a temporary ban on refugees being admitted to the US and other strict border measures targeting seven countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr Trump confirmed his administration would continue to honour the 2016 refugee resettlement arrangement while acknowledging a common interest in preventing irregular and illegal migration.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The president, in accordance with that deal to honour what had been agreed upon by the US government, and ensuring that vetting will take place in the same manner that we are doing it now, it will go forward,' Mr Spicer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are being held on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and Nauru.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters at the G'day USA gala in Hollywood, Ms Bishop said Mr Turnbull would travel to the US for a yet to be scheduled meeting with the president.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     TOUGH IMMIGRATION LAWS WHICH SEE 'BOAT PEOPLE' SENT TO OFFSHORE CAMPS                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offshore detention in Australia has been in place since 2001, and in 2013 Australia's mainland was excluded from its migration zone for people who arrive by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now migrants who arrive on Australian shores by sea are immediately sent to the island of Nauru or Papau New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stay in detention facilities while their applications to be accepted into Australia are processed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although 90 per cent are ruled to have valid claims, they are not allowed to settle in the Australian mainland, instead being allowed to stay in Nauru or Papau New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy has come under heavy fire, with conditions in the camp branded 'inhuman' by a UN inspector in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters claim it deters migrants from arriving in dangerous vessels, and ensures refugees enter the country through proper channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015 Australia agreed to accept 12,000 refugees from Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous year violence had erupted at a protest at the detention center on Manus Island, and a 23-year-old Iranian man was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull has previously stated that Australians cannot be 'misty-eyed' about immigration, saying: 'We must have secure borders and we do and we will, and they will remain so, as long as I am the prime minister of this country.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Donald Trump's ban on refugees entering Americahas caused chaos, confusion and anger across the globe, as people were turned back from US-bound flights and others were detained on arrival at American airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As lawyers for two men stopped at New York's JFK airport - individuals who worked for the US in Iraq and had been targeted for doing so - filed a lawsuit demanding their release, passengers at various airports, including places such as Cairo, were turned back. KLM announced it had refused carriage to the USto seven passengers from predominately Muslim countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Mr Trump signed a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travellers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries. He claimedthe moves would protect Americans from terrorism. &quot;We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,&quot; he said in a ceremony at the Pentagon, where he also signed an order to boost the US military.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The small group of reporters at JFK covering the #muslimban protest are asked to leave, told terminal 4 is &quot;private property&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Charlotte Alter (@CharlotteAlter) January 28, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enforcement of the order sparked outcry, not just in the US, but around the world, where travellers to the US were immediately confronted with uncertainty and doubt. Mr Trump had spoken during the election campaign of his intention to heighten screening of refugees, but refugees from the seven countries affected already face intense vetting that can last up to five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a stupid, terrible decision which will hurt the American people more than us or anybody else, because it shows that this President can't manage people, politics or global relationships,&quot; Najeed Haidari, a Yemeni-American security manager for an oil company in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, told Reuters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bans affect travellers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and even extends to green card holders who are granted authorisation to live and work in the United States, according to a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Jessica Goudeau (@jessica_goudeau) January 28, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news agency said that in Cairo, five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York on Saturday, according to sources at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     FindTheData.org | Graphiq                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May refuses to condemn Muslim ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Betsy Fisher of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said of the ban: &quot;[This] announcement is a betrayal of the fundamentally American value of welcoming those who are fleeing persecution. The US refugee programme is essential to US foreign relations and national security. Abandoning refugees means abandoning American humanitarian leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mana Yegani, an immigration lawyer in Houston, who works with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said Customs and Border Patrol agents at many airports were unaware of the executive order early on Friday evening. She said she had spent the night fielding calls from travellers with student and worker visas who were being denied entry to the US.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump signed an executive order closing US borders to all refugees for a period of at least four months and temporarily banning all&nbsp;travellers&nbsp;from half a dozen countries, regardless of whether they have already been issued visas, on&nbsp;Friday evening.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,&quot; Trump said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. &quot;We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order, which came into force as soon as Mr Trump signed it, requires US border officials to turn away any traveller from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for the next 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only a few exceptions for diplomats and dual citizens, the order takes no account of whether travellers have already been issued with visas or have visited the United States before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were immediate&nbsp;reports&nbsp;of travellers who had been issued visas for travel being turned away or told not to board flights because of the ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Al Rawi, a graduate of California State University and former journalist with the Los Angeles Times, said his father had been hauled off a flight in Qatar as a direct result of Mr Trump's decision.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote on Facebook hours after the order was signed:&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, Reuters reported.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some airlines have warned that all passengers&nbsp;whose journeys began in any of the seven countries may be affected, even if their own citizenship is not on the &quot;banned&quot; list. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vera Mironova, a Russian citizen returning from an academic research trip to Iraq, said she had been warned at check in that she may not be allowed into the US despite holding a green card.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just talked to Lufthansa guys and since an hour ago they need to inform all people traveling from Iraq about this possibility,&quot; she said before boarding on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Lawyers mount legal challenge to refugee ban                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's decision to close America's borders to refugees was causing confusion and chaos at airports across the US, as people fleeing war zones were turned away by customs officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ban is now being met with several high profile challenges from lawyers at civil rights organisations who say that the demands made in the  executive order may be illegal .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immigration and Nationality Act, implemented by congress in 1965&nbsp;banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;President Lyndon B&nbsp;Johnson said as he signed the law that &quot;the harsh injustice&quot; of the national-origins quota system had been &quot;abolished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law states that&nbsp;&nbsp;no person could be &quot;discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detentions at airports around the US&nbsp;have&nbsp;prompted legal challenges. The New York Times reported  that lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy Airport filed a writ of habeas corpus early Saturday in the Eastern District of New York seeking to have their clients released. At the same time, they filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Iraqis, Khalid Darweesh, worked for the US government in Iraq for a decade. Whilst the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to the United States to join his wife and young son, the lawyers said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        &lt;table&gt;                                                                           </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorneys said they were barred from meeting with their clients. When they asked who they needed to talk to to remedy this, a Customs and Border Protection official told them to &quot;call Mr Trump&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the lawyers is from the Refugee Assistance Project. The group said in a statement that the executive order is&nbsp;&quot;irresponsible and dangerous&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation said: &quot;Denying thousands of the most persecuted refugees the chance to reach safety is an irresponsible and dangerous move that undermines American values and imperils our foreign relations and national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IRAP works with hundreds of the most vulnerable refugees - children with medical emergencies, survivors of gender-based violence and torture, and Afghan and Iraqi allies to U.S. forces, to name a few - who will be left in immediate life-threatening danger.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For many of them, resettlement in the United States is their only option to live safely and with dignity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also sparked concern in the business world.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google recalled all travelling staff members to the United States following the order amid concern&nbsp;about the possible impact on recruiting top talent abroad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Google spokesperson said:&nbsp;&quot;We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US.&nbsp; We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, wrote in a post on Saturday that he was &quot;concerned&quot; about the impact of the orders and that he would be working with Fwd.US, a charity he supports, to develop protections for child immigrants brought to the US at a young age by their parents.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order signed by Mr Trump also&nbsp;imposes a 120-day suspension the US refugee resettlement programme, regardless of applicants' country of origin, while administration officials develop additional vetting procedures and decide which countries those procedures are &quot;adequate&quot; to ensure safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government will continue to process requests from people claiming religious&nbsp;persecution, &quot;provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order suspended a resettlement programme that allowed 85,000 people fleeing war, hunger, and political or religious persecution, to be resettled in the US last year. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Ryan, the republican speaker of the House, said it was &quot;time to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR)&nbsp;and International Organization for Migration (IOM) called on Donald Trump's administration to continue offering asylum to people fleeing war and persecution, saying its resettlement programme was vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the U.S. resettlement programme is one of the most important in the world,&quot; the two Geneva-based agencies said in a joint statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies hoped &quot;that the US will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 25,000 refugees were resettled in the United States between October and year-end under UNHCR's programme for the most vulnerable, the agency said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said it would file a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the executive order on Monday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The modified version of Donald Trump's travel ban, which went into effect Thursday night, is a &quot;shameful&quot; act targeting &quot;Iranian grandmothers&quot;, Iran's foreign minister has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Travel ban 2.0 goes into effect despite courts saying security issues unfounded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen have been banned from obtaining a visa to enter the US if they fail to show a credible &quot;bona fide relationship&quot; with a person or entity in the US. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammad Javad Zarif, a close ally of Iran's moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, said on Twitter: &quot;US now bans Iranian grandmothers from seeing their grandchildren, in a truly shameful exhibition of blind hostility to all Iranians.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranians protested by sharing photos of their grandparents online using #GrandparentsNotTerrorists. &quot;This is my lovely grandma. @realDonaldTrump does she look like a terrorist to you? #GrandparentsNotTerrorists,&quot; tweeted Elham Khatami, who works for the National Iranian American Council (NIAC). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is my lovely grandma. @realDonaldTrump does she look like a terrorist to you? #GrandparentsNotTerroristspic.twitter.com/KkciEWBM1t - Elham Khatami (@ekhatami) June 29, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because Trump doesn't think I have a bonafide relationship with my grandpa... #GrandparentsNotTerrorists,&quot; tweeted another Iranian American, Ida Adibi, along with an image of her grandfather kissing her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NIAC's legal counsel, Shayan Modarres, said in a statement: &quot;Trump's pathological pursuit of the Muslim Ban has reached a new low by targeting grandparents of American children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are one million Iranian Americans in the United States and many cannot return home to visit loved ones,&quot; he said. &quot;President Trump's directive might as well pull children out of the arms of their grandparents who will no longer be able to visit for the sole reason that they are Iranian. The president is supposed to protect American families, not rip them apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the &quot;discriminatory&quot; and &quot;inhumane&quot; policy &quot;does nothing to add to America's security&quot;, and &quot;only creates divisions by turning some Americans into second-class citizens simply because of their ancestry&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has warned that the restrictive measures will have an immediate impact on already vetted refugees scheduled to go to the US. That includes Hossein Shahrabi, an Iranian refugee currently in Iraqi Kurdistan, waiting to be admitted by the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After five years waiting, Shahrabi was assigned for resettlement in the US 18 months ago after being recognised as in genuine need of protection. He said he underwent two interviews with American authorities a year ago, completed his medical examinations and was almost &quot;one step away&quot; from traveling to the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, this order changed the whole thing,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;The most distressing part is the three-month suspension of accepting refugees. This period could have been finished months ago; however, people like me should wait again for these three months to pass in order to be hopeful again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, no one talk that much about the effects of this order on refugees,&quot; he said. &quot;No other countries accept Iranians and we can do nothing but remain hopeful and optimistic.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cornell University law school professor Stephen Yale-Loehr said the state department instructions interpreted the supreme court's order too narrowly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over half of all refugees don't have close family ties in the US. Under these instructions, the 'lost boys' of Sudan - orphan children who fled famine and war and who came to the United States as refugees several years ago - would not be allowed to enter now,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extreme vetting already in place means Syrian refugees wait an average of 18-24 months before being admitted to the US, he said. &quot;The 21-step screening process goes through multiple agencies, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the US State Department, the FBI and the US.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;The Cato Institute calculates that the chance of being killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee is about one in 3.6 billion a year. The head of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services told Congress last September that not a single act of actual terrorist violence has been committed by a refugee 'who has undergone our screening procedures' since 9/11.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negar Mortazavi, a Washington DC-based Iranian-American journalist, said the &quot;Iranian community have been disproportionately affected by the travel ban&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamidreza Ranjbar is an Iranian blogger who has been an asylum seeker in Turkey for more than four years. &quot;For a lot of us, this is the final blow,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;This travel ban sets fire to a quilt to get rid of a moth.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmad Sadri, an Iranian American professor of sociology and anthropology at Lake Forest College, said: &quot;It doesn't matter that none of these countries have been involved in international terrorism for decades. It doesn't matter that a country such as Saudi Arabia that fomented the Islamist ideology for terrorism and spread it from Nigeria to Indonesia is not included in this ban. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter that this ban does nothing to promote the security of Americans one iota.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Wheeler feared his chances of survival were 50-50 when his own boat became pinned by huge waves against the rocks as he tried to resuscitate two refugee children who had been plucked from the water.</SPAN></P>

On the night of the tragedy, just after midnight and during a ferocious storm, the marines received an emergency call that a wooden fishing boat crammed with refugees was being pounded against the shoreline of Farmakonisi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was pitch black and the storm was unlike anything I've ever been in,&quot; said Wheeler, who has served for eight years in the marines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All we knew was that there were people in the water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time Wheeler and four other marines arrived at the scene in their rigid-hulled inflatable boat (Rib), the migrants' boat had &quot;disintegrated&quot;. Some migrants had managed to climb over the rocks and onto the shore but about 30 were in the water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wheeler pulled two children, a boy aged about five and a girl of about 12 months, into the Rib. But as the marines began giving them CPR, clothing discarded by other refugees became caught in the boat's engines, leaving it without power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A large wave picked us up and threw us onto the rock,&quot; Wheeler said. &quot;I grabbed a child under each arm to keep them in the boat. Our boat was literally on its side. Everyone was leaning onto it to keep it from going over because the rocks were like swords.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wheeler was smashed against the side of the Rib and injured his shoulder. &quot;If we had fallen into the sea I have no doubt that we would not have survived,&quot; Wheeler said. &quot; The state that some of the people we pulled out were in they looked like they had been attacked by swords.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second Rib was sent out and, although it also lost the use of one of its two engines, it managed to attach a line to Wheeler's boat and drag it clear of the rocks. As the two boats limped back to the Vos Grace, another refugee boat sped past them towards the rocks, with the migrants on board screaming for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember that being the point of the night when my stomach really sank,&quot; Wheeler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After returning to the Vos Grace and handing over the two children who did not survive, Wheeler volunteered to go straight back out and rescue more refugees. The migrants on the second boat managed to get ashore alive and the marines concentrated on plucking as many people from the water as they could. Of those thrown into the sea, the sole survivor was a Syrian girl aged five or six, called Sunja. Her sister drowned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the storm died, the marines returned to the island to retrieve 60 or 70 refugees who had made it ashore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first to step on board the Vos Grace were Sunja's parents, who hugged the marines who had saved her life. But for the other refugees who were led on board, the realisation slowly grew that Sunja was the sole survivor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central Mediterranean between Libya and Italy is now the route of choice for migrants, with thousands attempting it each week. More than 9,000 were rescued from drowning over Easter as they attempted to cross the sea in overcrowded boats. Around 36,000 are believed to have been rescued this year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only someone who has themselves fled tyranny can truly grasp the significance of what the government has just done. The Home Office suggestion that refugees could have their permanent residency reviewed, and possibly revoked, after five years will send a shiver down the spine of anyone who has lived under dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Refugees applying to live in UK face being sent home after five years</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remember all too well the enormous sense of relief I felt when I landed at Heathrow back in 1977. I had left South Africa after being active in the student movement following the Soweto uprising, and working to relaunch the non-racial trade union movement. Walking through Hyde Park with the grass beneath my feet and the wind in my face, an enormous weight had suddenly been lifted from me. The arrest and banning of my friends, the bugging of my phone, the notes on my car, the imminent threat of detention - all were suddenly gone. And like so many before me, I used my time to study, build a life and find a home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing special about my story. I wasn't in very much danger when I flew out of Cape Town. But it was that sense of abiding freedom that allowed me to stay. How many others would have had similar feelings - whether they were Huguenot weavers fleeing religious persecution in 17th-century France, German Jews in the 20th century or Eritreans today?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a stroke the Home Office has undone what Britain has offered down the generations: a place of sanctuary and security and, above all, a permanent home for those fleeing persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine the case of a woman who left her country fearing that her family might subject her to female genital mutilation. Here she is, having broken ties with her relatives and those she might in other circumstances rely on. She has taken the plunge, crossed borders and subjected herself to all the hazards of being in the hands of human traffickers to make her way to Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a sigh of relief, and a huge feeling of gratitude, she might have finally been granted leave to remain. Yet now the threat that once seemed to have been lifted has been reimposed. She will know only too well that the clock is ticking. At a stroke of a pen she might be put back on a plane and sent back to all that she fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is no idle threat. Charities are already warning that all that is needed is for a refugee to apply for a passport from their country of origin, or for a relative or dependent to return home, for the Home Office to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Ward of Human Rights Watch points out that the Home Office is contravening the spirit, if not the letter, of the Refugee Convention 1951. &quot;Under international law there is a responsibility to work for the integration of refugees into the host community, and this must have the opposite effect,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These measures come as the door for refugees is already closing. The case of Syrian refugees trapped in Turkey or Greece is well known. Less attention has been paid to the plight of people fleeing Eritrea, Nigeria and other parts of Africa for reasons ranging from persecution to war. The route via the Canary Islands or Spain has closed. Israel's fence along the Sinai means that almost no one gets to Europe that way any longer. This has left Libya and, to a lesser extent, Egypt as the only exits. And even these are on the way to being shut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  It's not charities' job to aid deportations | Lola Okolosie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain, along with the rest of the European Union, is effectively implementing a version of the system pioneered by Australia, where in 2001 refugees arriving by boat began to be outsourced to detention camps including that on the Pacific island of Nauru. Would-be travellers to Europe are increasingly being prevented from leaving Libya and instead becoming trapped in camps there. Some camps are controlled by Libya's fragile government, others by Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's children's agency, Unicef, published details last month of just how terrifying these camps are. No one is under any illusion about the fate of prisoners held in these pits of despair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet even if they escape - even if they make the long and dangerous journey through Italy and France, and finally make it to Britain - they cannot now know&nbsp;that they will have found a permanent sanctuary. To suggest that the Home Office regulations are heartless doesn't even come close. They are a sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of the most vulnerable members of our community.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olympic hero Sir Mo Farah could be banned from returning to his home in America after  Donald Trump 's immigration crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sprinter, who lives with his family in Oregon, is believed to be training in Ethiopia at the moment, and recently tweeted from there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump's immigration crackdown prevents refugees coming into the USA from seven Muslim majority countries for 90 days and those from Syria &nbsp;indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has triggered a furious backlash across the world and in Britain Theresa May was forced into a dramatic U-turn to condemn the US President's ban.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She faced mutiny from within the Tory party after she refused three times to criticise Mr Trump's move yesterday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last night Downing Street issued a statement saying she does 'not agree' with the refugee ban and will make representations if it affects Britons.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the about-turn only came after Tory MPs criticised her publicly on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraqi born MP Nadhim Zahawi revealed the ban applies to him and demanded Mrs May stand up to President Trump and not 'look away'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Wollaston, another senior Tory MP, said Mr Trump should be barred from making the usual address to Parliament when he visits the UK later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a sign of the anger against and Tory MP Heidi Allen tweeted directly at Mrs May saying: 'Strong leadership means not being afraid to tell someone powerful when they're wrong. It's an ethos this country is proud of.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban also affects those with dual nationality, who were born in one of the seven countries, returning to the USA if they are currently away.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement that the State Department is due to release, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the 90-day visa moratorium extends beyond just citizens of Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also applies to people who originally hail from those countries but are traveling on a passport issued by any other nation, the statement notes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Mo is originally from Somalia and moved to the UK when he was eight-years-old.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he was born in one of the countries President Trump has targeted, travelling on a British passport will not help him return home.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement means Iraqis seeking to enter the U.S. on a British passport, for instance, will be barred, according to a U.S. official. British citizens don't normally require a visa to enter the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Travelers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa,' the statement said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or non-immigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period. Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump defended his tough new immigration bans, and&nbsp;denied that his executive order, which bars refugees and citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US, was a Muslim ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Conservative MP also tweeted to say he is banned from the USA under President Trump's controversial ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadhim Zahawi represents Stratford-on-Avon but both he and his wife were born in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tweeted: 'I'm a British citizen &amp; so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear ill [sic] be banned from the USA based on my country of birth.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: 'Had confirmation that the order does apply to myself and my wife as we were both born in Iraq. Even if we are not dual Nat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A sad sad day to feel like a second class citizen! Sad day for the USA.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban has also already affected an Iranian director nominated for an Oscar, who now won't be able to attend the Hollywood award ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated in the best foreign film category for his movie The Salesman but there are fears he may now not be able to attend next month's Academy Awards, because he was born in Iran.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian-born actress who stars in Farhadi's The Salesman vowed to boycott the Oscars over Trump's immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taraneh Alidoosti, the 33-year-old known as the Natalie Portman of Iran, took to Twitter with a message for fans on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest,' she tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ANTI-IMMIGRATION ORDER DO?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban refugee entries from all countries for 120 days. Refugees can be accepted on case-by-case basis, including&nbsp;if they are a religious minority facing religious persecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Block refugee entries from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap refugee intake at 50,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban visa and immigration entries for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries on banned list, including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspend visa issuance to countries of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian-born Hessam Noorian, who has a British passport and a US Green Card was held at Chicago airport for five hours as he tried to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they asked him several questions, and searched his backpack and possessions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has an Iranian passport and a British passport, and was told possession of the Iranian passport necessitated the questions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took five hours to receive a waiver, he told the Chicago Tribune. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven refugees bound for the U.S. were stopped from boarding a plane in Cairo on Saturday and 12 migrants were detained in New York overnight because they arrived just after the executive order was signed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqi refugees who was detained for 14 hours at New York, was released on Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 53-year-old had arrived in America on a flight from Istanbul on Friday night, just hours after Trump implemented the immigration ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had worked for the U.S. government in Iraq for 10 years as a translator, engineer and contractor and had a valid special immigration visa to relocate to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dual-citizenship ban doesn't apply to U.S. citizens who are also citizens of the seven nations singled out by Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department statement also said such restrictions don't apply to people from those countries traveling on diplomatic visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. consulate in Erbil have stopped accepting visa applications from Iraqi nationals until further notice, except for certain diplomatic exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The urgent steps come as State Department officials try to sort out how to implement Mr. Trump's broadly-worded policy executive order. Officials said they received little information about the ban before it took effect from the Trump team.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One described how a draft of the order was brought in unofficially to the State Department earlier this week to review before it took effect.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, Theresa May repeatedly refused to criticise President Trump's executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At&nbsp;a news conference in Ankara, Prime Minister May said: 'The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.&nbsp;The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom's policy on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And our policy on refugees is to have a number of voluntary schemes to bring Syrian refugees into the country, particularly those who are most vulnerable but also to provide significant financial contributions to support refugees in countries surrounding Syria.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday evening, a Downing St spokesman said&nbsp;Theresa May does 'not agree' with Donald Trump's refugee ban and will make representations if it hits Britons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However just yards away from her, Prime Minister Yildirim was putting the boot in, saying building walls would not help the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: 'We cannot solve this refugee problem by putting up walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We opened our doors, and if they come again, we would take them again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Regional problems cannot be solved by sweeping them under the carpet.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: 'British citizens banned from the US and our government has nothing to say? Disgrace.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Mirror, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: 'Not only is this shocking even by her standards, it cannot be allowed to stand. The President's actions have horrified the world, and this is a moment when she has to show what side she is on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At the press conference she contrived to make the Turkish government look liberal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They said it was wrong to build walls. Rather than fighting to build a world that is open, tolerant and united, Theresa May is dividing the world in a very dangerous way.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order&nbsp;declares that U.S. policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also&nbsp;gives Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year, according to the order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups were held by Customs and Border Protection officials after getting off a Qatar Airways flight at 7.25am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just three hours later the Christian families - both with legally-obtained visas - were put back on a plane to Doha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of their relatives said: &quot;This is like a nightmare come true. They're all Christian citizens and the executive order was supposed to protect Christians fleeing persecution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslim travellers are reporting horror stories of being turned away from the US just hours after Donald Trump banned nationals from seven countries from entering America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new US President last night ordered a four-month ban on all refugees entering the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump also said no visas will be issued to nationals from seven mainly-Muslim nations of Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban has sparked outrage among many international organisations and Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech giant Google has reportedly told its overseas staff who could be affected by the rule change to return to the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslim travellers have also started reporting problems getting into America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former journalist with the Los Angeles Times Mohammed Al Rawi said his 71-year-old father had been taken off a flight in Qatar and sent back to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing on Facebook, he said: &quot;My 71 year old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and and he's being sent back to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some US official told him that Trump canceled all visas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were also reportedly barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York today, sources at Cairo airport said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also reports of Syrians who have given up everything who are trapped at US airports and unable to enter the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,&quot; Trump said on Friday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has this morning condemned the ban while civil rights groups have said the order is harmful and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filmmaker Michael Moore said: &quot;That the President of the United States would order on Holocaust Memorial Day the banning of a people due to their religion is reprehensible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump claimed the move would keep America safer, despite evidence which shows none of the countries on the list have been the source of terror attacks on US soil since 9/11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having given no notice of the ban, it caused chaos for thousands of Arab-American families who already had family members en route to visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were reports of Syrian families who have spent up to two years being vetted for a visa left stranded at the airport having sold all their possessions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tweet3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Trump chose Holocaust Memorial Day to make the announcement was all the more upsetting for many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,&quot; Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton, an Iraq War veteran, said: &quot;President Trump is leading our country out of fear instead of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His executive orders banning refugees and immigrants from some Muslim majority countries to the United States plays right into the hands of our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ISIS has already used his statements to help recruit new suicide bombers, and you can bet Trump's policies will help inspire attacks against Americans both at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His policies literally put our troops' live at risk - I've heard this loud and clear when I have visited them overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also prove he has zero understanding of our country's values and no intention of defending out constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of immigrants, and America is stronger when we welcome the refugees of our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These policies do no not put America first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am ashamed he is our president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a statement: &quot;I am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and father fleeing violence and war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants - the people who helped build your country, ready to work in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am heartbroken that Syrian refugee children, who have suffered through six years of war by no fault of their own, are singled out for discrimination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups have condemned the order as harmful and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Extreme vetting is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,&quot; American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Identifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favoring or discriminating against particular religions,&quot; Romero said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Trump said that Syrian Christians will be given priority when it comes to applying for refugee status, a policy that would likely be challenged on similar grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians,&quot; Trump said in an excerpt of an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, discussing the Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics provided by the Pew Research Center last October do not support Trump's argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything you need to know about Donald Trump's Mexico wall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pew research found that 38,901 Muslim refugees entered the United States in fiscal year 2016 from all countries, almost the same number, 37,521, as Christian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Legomsky, a former Chief Counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, said prioritising Christians could be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump's move would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a completely plausible prioritisation, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,&quot; Spiro said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order temporarily suspends the United States' main refugee programme which helped around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected to affect two programmes U.S. lawmakers created a few years after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to help the tens of thousands of Iraqis who risked their lives helping Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump says the order is necessary to prevent Islamist militants from coming to the United States posing as refugees, but refugee advocacy groups say the lengthy screening of applicants by multiple U.S. agencies makes this fear unfounded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT'S THE STORY?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH the war in Syria well into its seventh year, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has teamed up with internet giant Google to give people a different view of the war-torn country in an interactive, online presentation at https://searchingforsyria.org/en/ Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, describes it as &quot;the biggest humanitarian and refugee crisis of our time&quot;, which has seen more than five million Syrians fleeing the bombs and bullets that have devastated their homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The production offers two views of Syria which, for most of us, will be new.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We explore Jordan's Za'atari refugee camp in a somewhat different light,&quot; says UNHCR. &quot;If you've never been to Syria, here's your chance to roam the souks in the heart of Damascus, discover the ancient ruins of Palmyra and meet some of the friendly locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Was life in pre-war Syria really that different to your own? We reckon you might spot a few surprising similarities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIKE WHAT?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT people searched for on the internet is one example. Before the latest fighting broke out in 2011, Syria was a bustling, vibrant country with a population of more than 22 million, many of whom led similar lives to people in other developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Music, fashion and sport were among the most popular pastimes, and in 2010 the most popular internet search terms were Arab Idol, bodybuilding, summer fashion and Miley Cyrus. FC Barcelona videos were popular on YouTube and, also in 2010, Gorillaz - the virtual band created by Blur's Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett - became the biggest Western band to play there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had a flourishing tourist industry, with more visitors than Australia - 8.5 million compared to 5.8 million. This industry was worth $6.3bn (&pound;4.8bbn) in 2010 and was projected to reach $8bn (&pound;6.2bn) by the following year. Instead the 2011 figure plummeted to just $1.8bn (&pound;1.3bn).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourists would flock to Syria to explore ancient Roman ruins, massive deserts and bustling bazaars, along with pristine beaches and mosques from the early days of Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria has been a centre of art and culture since 3,000 BC and was immensely proud of its unique art and architecture, which was shaped by many civilisations - including Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Islamic. Damascus was the Arab City of Culture in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT HAPPENED?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIDDLE Eastern countries have long been volatile and Syria is no different, with a history of conflict stretching for decades. Much of its air force was destroyed by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, which saws Israel seize the Golan Heights. Fast-forward to 2000, and the death of President Hafez al-Assad propelled his son - current President Bashar al-Assad - into office. He turned out to be not as enlightened as many had hoped and incorporated the military into his political regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, 2011, several teenagers painted anti-government graffiti on buildings in the southern city of Deraa and subsequent peaceful protests called for their release. However, these spread into larger demonstrations calling for democratic reform and security forces shot dead several protesters in Deraa. This triggered further unrest that resulted in the army and tanks being used to disperse the protests which, in turn, spiralled into the conflict we have now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But UNHCR is not political - and neither is its presentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT ELSE DOES IT TELL US?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT gives the viewer a flavour of the Syria that was home to six UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Aleppo, which dates back to the 2nd millennium BC; 40 abandoned villages from the late Antiquity and Byzantine periods; Crac des Chevaliers and Qal'at Salah El-Din - two castles dating back to the Crusades; the ancient Roman ruins of Palmyra; archaeological ruins in the city of Bosra on the route to Mecca; and the capital Damascus, one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war has damaged or destroyed every one of them. For example, we see the splendid Great Umayyad Mosque of Aleppo in all its shining glory in 2009. Now, it bears more relation to a building site, illustrating that the Syria as it was no longer exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than two million Syrians have been killed or injured - around 24,000 of them children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The production also introduces us to some of the people who have fled Syria seeking refuge in other countries, including seven-year-old Bana, who became a social media phenomenon sharing her experience of war on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She shared videos of bombs exploding outside her home in Aleppo, and her tweets are etched in many minds: &quot;This is what remains of our childhood memories. Next to our house, I thought the bombs hit me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if there are people inside the house. Why would they bomb us and kill innocent people everyday? - Bana&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the Manus Island detention centre, everything is watched. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guards stand over public and private spaces, CCTV monitors corridors and staircases, while roving patrols detail in incident reports where refugees are gathered and who is talking with whom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the move to an ostensibly &quot;open&quot; centre, the level of surveillance inside the detention centre remains, according to those held within it, oppressively high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everywhere we can go they are watching,&quot; said one refugee, who declined to give his name because he feared it could jeopardise his application to be resettled in the US. &quot;Even outside the camp, they are following, monitoring us. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no freedom, no peace. We have no life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Revealed: year-long campaign to make conditions harsher for Manus refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents obtained by the Guardian reveal how in detention, refugees and asylum seekers are forensically monitored by staff, who report back to central databases on issues such as their appearance (&quot;Well-groomed/dishevelled&quot;); their manner (&quot;Engaged with a warm manner&quot;, &quot;Unstable and incoherent&quot;); and associations (&quot;Seen talking to X and Y&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All refugees and asylum seekers are given &quot;risk ratings&quot; based on their past behaviour, risk of suicide or self-harm, behaviour towards others, and history of refusing to eat or drink. Any change in demeanour, even in something as simple as failing to say hello to a caseworker or guard, is noted and categorised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daily the camp &quot;mood&quot; is rated, and a &quot;threat level&quot; assessed, considering the likelihood of disturbance, violence or mass protest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the move to an &quot;open&quot; centre on Manus, and permission being given for refugees to have mobile phones, camp managers maintain a close watch on communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Computer use is comprehensively monitored and landline phone calls inside the detention centre are all listened in on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while everything inside detention is scrutinised, of perhaps even greater concern is an all-pervasive fear over outside eyes looking in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime among the Australian camp manager's concerns about the Manus immigration detention centre is the risk of &quot;reputational damage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its planning documents reveal repeated concern about &quot;adverse media&quot; and the release of information &quot;causing reputational damage to PNG/Australian governments&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several refugee advocates seeking to visit Manus have been turned around at Papua New Guinean immigration in recent weeks, while others have been arrested, removed from Manus Island, and deported from the country. Journalists have had their pictures plastered on posters around the camp with warnings - Toksave - that they should not be spoken to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free reportage has been the bete noire of the detention regime on Manus. The &quot;media handling&quot; directions for the centre tell staff &quot;the department has an interest in the management of publicity and media&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No member of staff employed by any service provider in any capacity will make unauthorised statements or comments to the media at any time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Border Force Act, detention centre workers who speak publicly about conditions inside or treatment of refugees face up to two years' jail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A media inquiry at the detention centre, or &quot;anything likely to cause major media interest&quot;, is ranked as a &quot;critical incident&quot;, the same rank as somebody murdering someone or killing themselves, an escape, a fire in the detention centre or large-scale protests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1156 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven Syrian brothers sit on the floor inside the trailer and fidget quietly. The living-cum-sleeping room, with just a few cushions and an old television set - for which there is electricity only a few hours a day - is spotless despite the dusty camp outside, and all the boys are neatly dressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From seven-year-old Hussein (sweeping) to 17-year-old Hasan (cooking), each has a task supervised by the eldest, Khalid, 19, who manages the 140 Jordanian dinar (&pound;151) they get a month to live on, plus a little extra he earns as a guard in one of the camp schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khalid would prefer to be studying himself but has little choice. Their father disappeared at the start of the war in Syria and, in summer 2012, with their village under siege by the Syrian army, the seven boys and their mother, Wadha, fled across the desert to Jordan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, in August 2015, their mother left alone for Germany, expecting to be able to send for them under the EU family reunification scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the closure of European borders to refugees, along with the failure of EU member states to take in more than a fraction of the 160,000 they pledged to resettle, has left the brothers among thousands whose families have been torn apart. Almost two years since their mother left, they remain stranded in Jordan's enormous Zaatari camp, waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, the boys are shy about saying how they feel. Then Ehsan, 11, ventures: &quot;I miss a mother's love - someone who is good to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We miss her cooking,&quot; says Mohammed, 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss her because of everything!&quot; says Khalid, who found himself, then 17, head of the family when she left. &quot;I used to go to school and wanted to study business management but now it's impossible as I am responsible for the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp has been completely transformed from the small collection of tents when they first arrived five years ago, like many, from Daraa, where the Syrian revolution started. Now Zaatari is one of the world's largest refugee camps, home to 80,000 people, with 12 mosques, 11 schools and its own football league.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many trailers have been painted with murals of everything from planets to pyramids in an attempt to bring some colour and cheer. But it is surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards, testament to riots and violence. Domestic abuse is common and the marriage of girls as young as 14 is on the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything is difficult about living in a refugee camp,&quot; says Khalid. &quot;We don't have electricity 24/7, only certain hours of the day, and in summer it gets very hot and water is very scarce. Also people don't have enough to do here, so they fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps hardest of all is the waiting. &quot;Every month I tell my brothers, 'Next month they will send us to Germany' ... I don't want them to lose hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2,500 miles away in D&uuml;sseldorf, Wadha Ahmad Alsamara misses her children desperately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I left for Germany because I thought my sons would have a better life here than in the camp, they could study and work, and also to get medical treatment for my youngest,&quot; she explains. Hussein lost an eye in an accident in Syria and his glass eye no longer fits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She travelled alone because she could afford only the $2,000 for one person and feared it would be dangerous. She had to go back into Syria and cross the war-torn country to Turkey. It took her three attempts in a smuggler's dinghy to cross the sea to Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am crying all the time,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought once I got to Germany I could bring the children quickly. Instead, they are stuck there and I am stuck here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef, the UN children's fund, has taken up the boys' case and last week Khalid had an interview at the German embassy, which gave him hope. But Wadha is still waiting to be granted asylum and has been told it might be another three years before the boys can join her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reuniting of families has been temporarily suspended by the German interior ministry - some believe deliberately until after the September election, since allowing families to reunite could mean another 2m people coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is true that asylum seekers who've been granted subsidiary protection are not able to apply for family reunification right now, because the reunification has been suspended for two years,&quot; confirmed Kira Gehrmann, of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. &quot;This doesn't, however, apply to asylum seekers who have been granted asylum or refugee protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet even those seem to have stopped. The delay puts further strain on Jordan and Lebanon, which have taken in most refugees. In Jordan, a quarter of the government's budget is spent on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with The Sunday Times Magazine today, Queen Rania of Jordan is critical of the EU response. &quot;Jordan is a small country, the size of Hungary, and we have taken in 1.3m Syrian refugees, whereas the whole of Europe has struggled to take in 1m,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Though I am really proud of the Jordanian response, it really pains me to see how much Jordanians have had to suffer and how high a price they have had to pay for the world's complacency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fate of broken families stuck in nowhere land will be raised by Unicef at the G7 summit on May 26 and 27 in Sicily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Unicef, by the start of this year only 9,940 refugees and migrants, including 3,310 children, had been relocated from Greece and Italy, a fraction of the 160,000 agreed by EU states in 2015. It is not known how many are family reunifications. Only 166 unaccompanied children have been relocated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Crowe, Unicef spokeswoman on the refugee crisis, said delays forced children to make their own way to join family members: &quot;In their desperation and frustration, children will take things into their own hands and find their own way through hell and high water, so often get caught in prostitution because the only currency they have is their bodies.&quot; @christinalamb</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louise Callaghan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ancient city of Hatra in Iraq has been liberated from Isis control, having been spared the worst of the Islamists' destructive zeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hatra, southwest of Mosul, was a site of worship to the sun god Shamash, built by the Seleucid dynasty established by Seleucus I, one of Alexander the Great's generals. It fared much better than the Syrian city of Palmyra and the Iraqi site of Nimrud under Isis control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not too bad,&quot; said Layla Salih, a former curator of Mosul museum, from the site yesterday. &quot;The area is safe now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city - a sprawling complex of 200ft-high columns and temples that featured in the opening scene of The Exorcist - was taken by Isis in 2014, and liberated by fighters The temples of Hatra feature in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist affiliated to the Iraqi government. In 2015, Isis militants released a video showing swordwielding men destroying carved statues thought to date from the 2nd century BC. &quot;[Isis] has sent us to these idols to destroy them,&quot; a fighter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large parts of Palmyra and Nimrud were levelled by Isis last year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billionaire businessman Donald Trump became President of America on January 20, 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just over a week into his tenure in the Oval Office, and his order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US - as well as banning refugees from Syria entering indefinitely - has seen a global backlash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his presidential campaign, Trump called for &quot;a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the campaign he promised to &quot;build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall&quot;. He added: &quot;Mark my words.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when he won the election and became president-elect, there was debate over whether he might row back a little from those statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since taking power, these are the policies he has actually moved to enact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has blocked immigrants and visa holders from seven countries - Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Sudan - from entering the US for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing his &quot;extreme vetting&quot; plan, he invoked the September 11 attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the hijackers on that day were from Saudi Arabia. The rest were from the UAE, Egypt and Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Islamic terrorists, Mr Trump was reported by the New York Times to say: &quot;We don't want them here. We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is confusion around the order, but it seems to apply not just to refugees or immigrants seeking entry into the US for the first time, but even to people from those seven countries who currently hold green cards and are permanent US residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if they leave the US, they may not be allowed back in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green-card holders already in the US are reportedly being advised to postpone plans to travel abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somali-born athlete Sir Mo Farah - a four-time Olympic champion for Great Britain who now lives in the US - says he is scared he will &quot;have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restriction also applies to dual nationals. So a British citizen who is also a citizen of Iran will not be able to enter the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Civil Liberties Union has called it a &quot;euphemism for discriminating against Muslims&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal judge issued a temporary halt to the deportation of visa holders or refugees stranded at US airports, after the ACLU filed a lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had an immediate impact on people around the world, stranding legal residents of the US (and other countries) and travellers with visas at airports, where confusion reigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday evening, a top White House official appeared to reverse a key part of the order, the New York Times reported, saying that people from the affected countries who hold green cards will not be prevented from returning to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he also said border agents had &quot;discretionary authority&quot; to detain and question suspicious travelers from certain countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday Trump fired the acting US attorney general after she told justice department lawyers not to defend his executive order banning entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House said Sally Yates had &quot;betrayed&quot; the department by refusing to enforce a legal order that was &quot;designed to protect the citizens of the United States&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Refugee Admissions Programme has been suspended for 120 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This suspends the entry of refugees into the US and directs officials to determine additional screening &quot;to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also set a cap of 50,000 refugees to be accepted to the US in 2017. Barack Obama had set the limit at 110,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raymond Offensheiser, the president of Oxfam America, said: &quot;The refugees impacted by today's decision are among the world's most vulnerable people... who are simply trying to find a safe place to live after fleeing unfathomable violence and loss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a critical humanitarian crisis in Syria, where civilians have been dying in huge numbers as a result of the country's civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost five million people have been displaced from Syria since the civil war began - in 2016, 12,587 of them ended up in the US as refugees, said The Guardian, who also reported that America's Syrian refugee resettlement programme has been called &quot;one of the most important in the world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the UN, more than 400,000 people have died in Syria's civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order stops the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another executive order signed by Trump reinstated the so-called &quot;global gag rule&quot;, to use the term adopted by its critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Vox, &quot;this is a a policy from previous Republican administrations that blocks federal funding from international family planning organisations that 'either provide abortion or discuss abortion services with their clients'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House press secretary Sean Spicer said this would &quot;end the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas, along with coercive abortion and sterilization practices&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Vox reports that there's already a law in place to prevent foreign aid from being used to provide aboritions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;global gag rule&quot; goes further by also taking funding from international organisations that discuss abortion services (which could then be privately funded).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump is not the first to do this, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy was introduced in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, every Democratic president has rescinded the measure and every Republican has brought it back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen said: &quot;We know that when family planning services and contraceptives are easily accessible, there are fewer unplanned pregnancies, maternal deaths, and abortions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This executive order called on the Department of Homeland Security to &quot;take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second order pledges to hire 10,000 more immigration officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he was going to build the wall, which he described as &quot;beautiful&quot;, and insisted it would be paid for by the Mexican government, who have repeatedly said they won't be doing that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US-Mexico border is 1,989 miles long and there are already fences built along parts of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the US doesn't own all of the land adjacent to the border, law professor Philip Schrag told CBS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;In Texas, apparently there are a great many of the lands adjacent to the border in private hands, so the government would first have to seize the land by eminent domain or purchase it from the owners and then deal with the construction problems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Keystone pipeline is a 1,179-mile pipeline being built, running from Canada to America's Gulf Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would carry petroleum. Its construction was halted by Barack Obama in 2015, with concerns over how its continued construction squared with a commitment to climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dakota Access pipeline would carry crude oil from the state of North Dakota to other parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been massive protests over its construction after the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said the pipeline interfered with their drinking water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in December, the Army Corps of Engineers said it would explore an alternative route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump signed memorandums that renew the process for constructing both pipelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trans-Pacific Partnership (or TPP) negotiations began under President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has issued a memorandum that called on the US to pull out of the partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal had never actually gone into effect in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) was a huge overhaul of the US healthcare system done by the previous president's administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its aim was to extend health insurance coverage to those in the US that didn't have it (an estimated 15%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It did this by requiring all Americans to have health insurance but offering subsidies to make coverage more affordable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also required businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to offer health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have constantly opposed it, however, saying it imposes too many costs on business and intrudes too far into the lives and affairs of private businesses and individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first things Trump did as president was to issue a directive to federal agencies involved in the healthcare system to &quot;waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay&quot; any portion of the Affordable Care Act that creates financial burden on states, individuals or healthcare providers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this should be done &quot;to the maximum extent permitted by law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This order technically does not give these agencies any powers they don't already have - it's been described more as &quot;a planted flag&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump signed an order that he said would result in &quot;a great rebuilding of the armed services of the United States&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for budget negotiations to acquire new planes, ships and resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump said America's &quot;military strength will be questioned by no one, but neither will the nation's commitment to peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frozen hiring by the federal government Trump issued a memorandum imposing a freeze on all federal civilian employees &quot;across the board&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No vacant positions were allowed to be filled and no new positions could be created &quot;except in limited circumstances&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memorandum does not apply to military personnel. Trump wants to reduce government debts and decrease the size of the federal workforce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslim nationals from seven countries have been banned for 90 days and all refugees have been dealt a horrific four month ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen have all been informed that no visas will be issued for the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban has sparked outrage among many international organisations and Americans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech giant Google has reportedly told its overseas staff who could be affected by the rule change to return to the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslim tourists have also started reporting problems getting into America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former journalist with the Los Angeles Times Mohammed Al Rawi said his 71-year-old father had been taken off a flight in Qatar and sent back to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing on Facebook, he said: &quot;My 71 year old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and and he's being sent back to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some US official told him that Trump canceled all visas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were also reportedly barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York today, sources at Cairo airport said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also reports of Syrians who have given up everything who are trapped at US airports and unable to enter the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,&quot; Trump said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has this morning condemned the ban while civil rights groups have said the order is harmful and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filmmaker Michael Moore said: &quot;That the President of the United States would order on Holocaust Memorial Day the banning of a people due to their religion is reprehensible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump claimed the move would keep America safer, despite evidence which shows none of the countries on the list have been the source of terror attacks on US soil since 9/11.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Trump chose Holocaust Memorial Day to make the announcement was all the more upsetting for many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,&quot; Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican senator Seth Moulton, an Iraq War veteran, said: &quot;President Trump is leading our country out of fear instead of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His executive orders banning refugees and immigrants from some Muslim majority countries to the United States plays right into the hands of our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ISIS has already used his statements to help recruit new suicide bombers, and you can bet Trump's policies will help inspire attacks against Americans both at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His policies literally put our troops' live at risk - I've heard this loud and clear when I have visited them overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also prove he has zero understanding of our country's values and no intention of defending out constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of immigrants, and America is stronger when we welcome the refugees of our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These policies do no not put America first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump wants to introduce 20% tax on Mexican imports to pay for border wall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am ashamed he is our president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a statement: &quot;I am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and father fleeing violence and war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants - the people who helped build your country, ready to work in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am heartbroken that Syrian refugee children, who have suffered through six years of war by no fault of their own, are singled out for discrimination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's Presidency in turmoil after entire State Department senior management quit rather than serve under him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups have condemned the order as harmful and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Extreme vetting is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,&quot; American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Identifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favoring or discriminating against particular religions,&quot; Romero said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Trump said that Syrian Christians will be given priority when it comes to applying for refugee status, a policy that would likely be challenged on similar grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians,&quot; Trump said in an excerpt of an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, discussing the Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics provided by the Pew Research Center last October do not support Trump's argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pew research found that 38,901 Muslim refugees entered the United States in fiscal year 2016 from all countries, almost the same number, 37,521, as Christian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexican president CANCELS meeting with Donald Trump in breakdown of relations between two countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Legomsky, a former Chief Counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, said prioritising Christians could be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump's move would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a completely plausible prioritisation, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,&quot; Spiro said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order temporarily suspends the United States' main refugee programme which helped around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected to affect two programmes U.S. lawmakers created a few years after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to help the tens of thousands of Iraqis who risked their lives helping Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump says the order is necessary to prevent Islamist militants from coming to the United States posing as refugees, but refugee advocacy groups say the lengthy screening of applicants by multiple U.S. agencies makes this fear unfounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump moving forward on 'the wall' and banning refugees from Muslim countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners said Britain should move to step up and help Syrian refugees in the wake of Trump's ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said: &quot;     We're appalled that President Trump is closing the door to refugees fleeing terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Restricting America's role in resettlement in the middle of the worst refugee crisis on record will have a huge impact on this vital global programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the world's most vulnerable people will be left struggling to survive in camps and on the borders of conflict zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thankfully we know Britain is better than this. Now is the time to step up and increase our commitment to protect those forced to flee war and persecution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers have announced a legal challenge to the order, which the US Department for Homeland Security confirmed on Saturday afternoon&nbsp;applies to&nbsp;green card holders, meaning&nbsp;lawful permanent residents of the&nbsp;United States will be barred from returning if they travel abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Watch | Donald Trump's first weekly address                         02:21</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump signed an executive order closing US borders to all refugees for a period of at least four months and temporarily banning all&nbsp;travellers&nbsp;from half a dozen countries, regardless of whether they have already been issued visas, on&nbsp;Friday evening.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,&quot; Trump said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. &quot;We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Rupert Myers (@RupertMyers) January 28, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order, which came into force as soon as Mr Trump signed it, requires US border officials to turn away any traveller from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for the next 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only a few exceptions for diplomats and dual citizens, the order takes no account of whether travellers have already been issued with visas or have visited the United States before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were immediate&nbsp;reports&nbsp;of travellers who had been issued visas for travel being turned away or told not to board flights because of the ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banned from the&nbsp;Academy Awards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They included an Iranian film director nominated for an Oscar&nbsp;in the Best Foreign Film category who will&nbsp;be unable to attend this year's ceremony in the wake of President&nbsp; Trump 's&nbsp;ban.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mohammed Al Rawi, a graduate of California State University and former journalist with the Los Angeles Times, said his father had been hauled off a flight in Qatar as a direct result of Mr Trump's decision.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote on Facebook hours after the order was signed:&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, Reuters reported.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some airlines have warned that all passengers&nbsp;whose journeys began in any of the seven countries may be affected, even if their own citizenship is not on the &quot;banned&quot; list. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vera Mironova, a Russian citizen returning from an academic research trip to Iraq, said she had been warned at check in that she may not be allowed into the US despite holding a green card.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just talked to Lufthansa guys and since an hour ago they need to inform all people traveling from Iraq about this possibility,&quot; she said before boarding on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers mount legal challenge to refugee ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's decision to close America's borders to refugees was causing confusion and chaos at airports across the US, as people fleeing war zones were turned away by customs officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ban is now being met with several high profile challenges from lawyers at civil rights organisations who say that the demands made in the  executive order may be illegal .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immigration and Nationality Act, implemented by congress in 1965&nbsp;banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;President Lyndon B&nbsp;Johnson said as he signed the law that &quot;the harsh injustice&quot; of the national-origins quota system had been &quot;abolished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law states that&nbsp;&nbsp;no person could be &quot;discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detentions at airports around the US&nbsp;have&nbsp;prompted legal challenges. The New York Times reported  that lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy Airport filed a writ of habeas corpus early Saturday in the Eastern District of New York seeking to have their clients released. At the same time, they filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Iraqis, Khalid Darweesh, worked for the US government in Iraq for a decade. Whilst the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to the United States to join his wife and young son, the lawyers said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Brandon Friedman (@BFriedmanDC) January 28, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorneys said they were barred from meeting with their clients. When they asked who they needed to talk to to remedy this, a Customs and Border Protection official told them to &quot;call Mr Trump&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the lawyers is from the Refugee Assistance Project. The group said in a statement that the executive order is&nbsp;&quot;irresponsible and dangerous&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation said: &quot;Denying thousands of the most persecuted refugees the chance to reach safety is an irresponsible and dangerous move that undermines American values and imperils our foreign relations and national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IRAP works with hundreds of the most vulnerable refugees - children with medical emergencies, survivors of gender-based violence and torture, and Afghan and Iraqi allies to U.S. forces, to name a few - who will be left in immediate life-threatening danger.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For many of them, resettlement in the United States is their only option to live safely and with dignity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also sparked concern in the business world.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google recalled all travelling staff members to the United States following the order amid concern&nbsp;about the possible impact on recruiting top talent abroad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Google spokesperson said:&nbsp;&quot;We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US.&nbsp; We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, wrote in a post on Saturday that he was &quot;concerned&quot; about the impact of the orders and that he would be working with Fwd.US, a charity he supports, to develop protections for child immigrants brought to the US at a young age by their parents.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order signed by Mr Trump also&nbsp;imposes a 120-day suspension the US refugee resettlement programme, regardless of applicants' country of origin, while administration officials develop additional vetting procedures and decide which countries those procedures are &quot;adequate&quot; to ensure safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government will continue to process requests from people claiming religious&nbsp;persecution, &quot;provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order suspended a resettlement programme that allowed 85,000 people fleeing war, hunger, and political or religious persecution, to be resettled in the US last year. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Ryan, the republican speaker of the House, said it was &quot;time to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance | Donald Trump's immigration ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Democrats decried the move as &quot;un-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,&quot; said Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May refuses to condemn US refugee ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May&nbsp;refused to condemn Mr Trump's decision when she appeared at a joint press conference with&nbsp;Binali Yildirim, the prime minister of Turkey, following a meeting in Ankara.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Faisal Islam, the political editor of&nbsp;Sky News,&nbsp;whether she viewed it as an &quot;action of the leader of the free world,&quot; the Prime Minister&nbsp;replied that she had been&nbsp;&quot;very pleased&quot; to have met Mr Trump in Washington.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She proceeded to praise Britain's record on refugees, but avoided commenting on US policy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is responsible for the United States policy on refugees,&quot; she said when pressed on the issue a second time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Yildirim, commenting on the same issue,&nbsp;said&nbsp;UN members &quot;cannot turn a blind eye to this issue and settle it by constructing walls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, Germany and Luxembourg also voiced disquiet at the decision. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French Foreign Minister said many of Trump's decisions worried the two U.S. allies, including new immigration restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This can only worry us, but there are many subjects that worry us,&quot; Mr Ayrault said&nbsp;at a joint news conference in Paris with Sigmar Gabriel, his German counterpart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Gabriel said:&nbsp;&quot;The United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbour is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR)&nbsp;and International Organization for Migration (IOM) called on Donald Trump's administration to continue offering asylum to people fleeing war and persecution, saying its resettlement programme was vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the U.S. resettlement programme is one of the most important in the world,&quot; the two Geneva-based agencies said in a joint statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies hoped &quot;that the US will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 25,000 refugees were resettled in the United States between October and year-end under UNHCR's programme for the most vulnerable, the agency said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said it would file a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the executive order on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,&quot; said Lena Masri, the group's director of National Litigation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Nigerian jet has accidentally bombed a refugee camp killing more than 100 people after mistaking them for Boko Haram extremists.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the dead were six Red Cross workers who were with the refugees when the bombardment rained down on northeast Rann, near the border with Cameroon.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state government official was helping to coordinate the evacuation of wounded.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the wounded were two soldiers and Nigerians working for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the International Committee of the Red Cross, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen Red Cross workers were also wounded in the blast.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is believed to be the first time Nigeria's military has admitted to making such a mistake.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp in northeast Nigeria was for those made homeless by Boko Haram Islamists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior military source in the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, said the casualties were 'huge', adding: 'A fighter jet hit the wrong target.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF said its teams were trying to provide emergency first aid at its facility in the camp and were stabilising patients to evacuate the wounded from the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Our medical and surgical teams in Cameroon and Chad are ready to treat wounded patients.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are in close contact with our teams, who are in shock following the event,' it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which also had teams in the area, said only there were 'a number of people wounded and some killed', without specifying figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are currently in contact with the relevant authorities to organise medical assistance and evacuations,' an ICRC spokeswoman in Abuja said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Lucky Irabor, who heads the military operation against the militants, said the air force had been given coordinates of 'Boko Haram terrorists' in the Kala-Balge area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Unfortunately the strike was conducted but it turned out that the locals somewhere in Rann were affected,' he told reporters at a briefing in the Borno state capital, Maiduguri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irabor did not give casualty figures but said local staff from MSF and the ICRC were among those wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'These are the result of fog of war,' he added. 'It is unfortunate. That is the reason why this war must come to an end.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bombing comes as Nigeria's military claims further gains against the Islamic State group affiliate, pushing them out of captured territory and their remote bases in Borno state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the army said the conflict was in its final stages after nearly eight years of violence that has killed at least 20,000 and left more than 2.6 million others homeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been 'friendly fire' incidents in the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 2014 a military jet killed five civilians and wounded several others when it mistakenly bombarded Kayamla village in Konduga district of Borno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jet mistook the village for a Boko Haram camp during a night raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January that year, the convoy of a Nigerian senator was fired on by an air force jet which mistook the six-vehicle convoy under police and military escort for Boko Haram fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one was hurt and the military described the incident as an 'operational blunder'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villagers in the past have reported some civilian casualties in near-daily bombardments in northeastern Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irabor said he ordered the mission based on information that Boko Haram insurgents were gathering, along with geographic coordinates.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was too early to say if a tactical error was made, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general, who is the theater commander for counterinsurgency operations in northeast Nigeria, said the Air Force would not deliberately target civilians but there will be an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the nearly 300 Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014 and freed last year have said three of their classmates were killed by Air Force bombardments, according to the freed girls' parents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE reality of statelessness in the UK and overseas will be brought to the stage by a Bradford-based theatre company as part of Refugee Week (June 19 to 25).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Free to Stay' - described as a play about 'belonging and an exploration of life without nationality' was inspired by research with people who have first hand experience of statelessness in the UK and overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-artistic directors, Jen Nevin and Mike Auger from Bradford-based Displace Yourself Theatre, spent six months on the Thailand-Myanmar border working with stateless adults and children as well as people who had fled war and forced-labour. This was followed by ongoing research residencies across the country, creating the work in collaboration with individuals who have sought refuge in the UK in partnership with the British Red Cross Refugee Support Service.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The play's creative producer, Ben Rothera, explains it will be the first time the full production of 'Free to Stay' will be performed at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a Bradford-based company so to be able to perform at the West Yorkshire Playhouse is great. We have performed at a lot of venues locally, we have got a good relationship with Theatre in the Mill but it is really nice to be part of Refugee Week because it is so relevant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben says more than 600 are statelessness in Europe and about 10 million worldwide. &quot;It is a really urgent and prevalent issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explains how the play uses striking physical theatre, stunning projection along with a powerful soundtrack mixed with personal testimonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the performance at the West Yorkshire Playhouse at 1.30pm on Wednesday June 21, Ben says they are hoping to take the play to the Theatre in the Mill in Bradford as part of a tour in September and October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Free to Stay' forms part of a week-long programme of performances at the West Yorkshire Playhouse which is nationally renowned for its pioneering work supporting refugees and asylum seekers - becoming the UK's first Theatre of Sanctuary in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week begins with a social event 'Theatre of Sanctuary Big Get Together,'for refugees and asylum seekers on Monday June 19. This will form part of the nationwide 'Great Get Together' inspired by the late Batley and Spen MP, Jo Cox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other plays included in the Refugee Week programme are Windows of Displacement (Tues 20 - Wed 21 June), the premiere of the new solo show choreographed and performed by Yorkshire performer, Akeim Toussaint Buck and Scattered (Thur 22 June) by Tim Baker, based on the original production by Theatr Clwyd, and directed by John Young, a story of friendship between two teenage boys from contrasting backgrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An insightful talk for the public aimed at de-mystifying the reality of refugees' experiences takes place on Thurs 22 June at 5.30pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Yorkshire Playhouse Artistic Director James Brining said: &quot;West Yorkshire Playhouse is a theatre that tells incredible stories, and we're a richer cultural organisation because of the diversity of the city. We embrace and celebrate Refugee Week with performances and conversations which speak to and about the real experiences of many people who now find themselves living here. Theatre has an incredible potential to connect people from all walks of life and we hope our programme sparks conversation and thinking between all sorts of audiences whether they have just arrived or lived here all their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a Theatre of Sanctuary, West Yorkshire Playhouse offers a range of activities to support refugees and asylum seekers, such as a dedicated women's choir, youth and drama groups and special ticket offers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pakistani refugee's body has languished for two months in a Victorian morgue as his wife continues her fight to come and bury him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Ali, of Hazara ethnicity, came to Australia from Pakistan as a refugee and was granted protection before law changes in 2013 which would have sent him to Papua New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ali died on April 16 but&nbsp;Khan Salehi, from the Hazara Shamama Association of Australia, says the refugee's wife, Masooma, has been unable to collect and bury his body as the Australian Department of Immigration will not grant her a visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her request for an Australian tourist visa was denied, with the department explaining they were concerned there was little incentive for the mother-of-three to return to Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Mr Ali remains in the morgue of Latrobe Regional Hospital in Gippsland, in Victoria's south-east. He has no other family who can collect his body.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter, the department claims Masooma had a phone interview with immigration officials where she claimed she would not return to Pakistan, but Mr Salehi, a leader in the Australian Hazara community who has been working with her, denied this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Masooma is very disappointed with the situation,' he told Daily Mail Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'She just wants to attend the funeral.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masooma and her children have not seen Mr Ali since he came to Australia by boat more than six years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She intended to fly her youngest son, eight, to Australia with her to farewell his father - but to leave her other two children in Pakistan, something Mr Salehi says should help her case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'She wanted to come with her youngest son, and she has two other children. If she stayed here, who would take care of her other two children?' he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the family's situation in Pakistan, Mr Ali's body cannot be flown back, as it will cause problems for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter from the Department seen by Daily Mail Australia which refuses her visa stated the 'concern' she would not leave the country at the end of her visa outweighed any sympathy felt for her situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am not satisfied that your personal and economic circumstances in Pakistan would provide you with incentive to return and your expressed intention only to stay temporarily in Australia is genuine,' said the letter.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latrobe Regional Hospital Chief Medical Officer Dr Simon Fraser says the hospital have been in touch with the Hazara Shamama Association in Melbourne which is advocating on behalf of Mr Ali and his family</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are hopeful the issues surrounding Mr Ali's collection and burial will be resolved for the sake of his family,' Dr Fraser said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection told Fairfax  the decision to approve or deny a visa application was always 'carefully considered'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The likelihood of an applicant overstaying or seeking to remain in Australia is a matter that must be assessed,' they said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By David Williamson</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1640 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to close a scheme to bring unaccompanied refugee children to the UK has triggered an outcry in Wales and united leaders of different faith traditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 350 young people will come to Britain under a scheme pushed for by Lord &quot;Alf&quot; Dubs, a veteran of the Kindertransport which rescued 669 children from the Nazis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are an estimated 90,000 unaccompanied children across Europe and supporters of the scheme had hoped around 3,000 would find a new home here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catholic Archbishop of Cardiff George Stack criticised the decision to wind up the iconic scheme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I regret very much that the commitment to receive these unaccompanied children is not being honoured. We have a moral and humanitarian duty to accept them. And Jesus did say, 'Let the children come to me...'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Government has defended the decision to bring an end to the scheme, arguing it &quot;encourages the people traffickers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Anglican bishop of Swansea and Brecon, John Davies, said the 200 young people who have been allowed to come to the UK under the scheme so far represented a &quot;drop in the ocean&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The Dubs Amendment is about providing security, safety and shelter to children, driven from their homes by conflict, and who have been in Europe since March 2016. They have not just arrived, and all that they seek is a place of refuge, where they can be free from fear and persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, this debate is not about encouraging more to arrive, nor does it risk increasing the likelihood of trafficking. These children are on our borders now and they deserve our help now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wales has a proud record of providing sanctuary to those in need; and to disregard the plight of these children, by putting the Dubs amendment on hold, is an unwelcome blemish on that proud record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must demonstrate our compassion and solidarity with those who so desperately need our help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dai Hankey, who leads Red Community - a charity that seeks to stand against human trafficking in Wales - condemned the UK Government's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing that children will fall prey to human traffickers, he said: &quot;I would have to say that as a human, as a Christian and as a father, I am both gutted and disgusted by the UK Government's recent decision to wind up the Dubs amendment scheme. Sadly, rather than the responding to the needs of some of the world's most vulnerable children with courage and compassion, I fear that our gutless government has buckled under the pressure of rising xenophobia and raging nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I live in the cultural melting-pot of Cardiff's inner-city and have many good friends, young and old, who are currently seeking asylum. They are not terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are not scroungers. They are hurting people in need of hope and grace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sincerely pray that the government reverses its decision and that desperate children who are fleeing all manner of horrors might find sanctuary in a truly Great Britain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saleem Kidwai of the Muslim Council of Wales said people in Wales were ready to act as foster parents and open their homes to the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are willing to adopt and people are willing to adopt and people are willing to help to them,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think it will be much pressure on the Government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judith Morris, the General Secretary of the Baptist Union of Wales, has asked churches to write to Home Secretary Amber Rudd to express &quot;disappointment and opposition&quot; at the plans to wind up the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Last year I had the privilege of visiting Greece as part of an all women delegation from Churches Together in Britain and Ireland to see first hand the reality faced by the refugees. Many of those with whom we met were women and children who were seeking reunification with their husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the visit we learnt about the risks faced by women in particular and unaccompanied children. It is shocking and shameful that we are not doing more to help those children in particular who are in such vulnerable situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our duty and responsibility to offer assistance and to help as an expression of our Christian witness and love for those who are facing desperate times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong support to keep the scheme running also came from Geraint Tudur, the General Secretary of the Union of Welsh Independents, which represents Christians in 430 Welsh chapels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The thought that thousands of unaccompanied refugee children are roaming the streets of Europe is heartbreaking. The UK Government constantly speaks about 'British values' but evidently places little value on the lives and welfare of the refugee children, who are open to people trafficking and all kinds of manipulation and abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Claims by the Government about the capacity and willingness of local authorities to care for these children is highly questionable... Wales has an honourable tradition of taking in refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should welcome these children with open arms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huw Thomas of Christian Aid Wales was concerned about the &quot;very worrying signal&quot; the closure of the scheme would send to the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;A clear promise was made back in the summer that Britain would be shouldering its share of child refugees. Going back on that commitment sends a worrying signal in terms of international cooperation at a time when with the backdrop of Brexit and Donald Trump we should be saying we should be saying we want to fulfil our international obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is a moral imperative for wealthy countries to take their fair share of child refugees, not leave to Italy and Greece to shoulder the burden. We also need to remember that the vast majority of refugees in general are hosted in some of the world's poorest countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Thomas added: &quot;As far as our experience of communities in Wales goes, there is a huge amount of concern and a huge amount of willingness [to] welcome child refugees and refugees in general. I think that plays into the traditional and well-known Welsh sense of welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Theresa May would do well to listen to communities in Wales and indeed religious leaders in Wales who are speaking out on this issue and demanding the British Government do what they originally committed to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman said: &quot;Where push factors of conflict, poverty and desperation remain, closing safe and legal routes for protection means that children will be more vulnerable to unscrupulous and exploitative practices such as trafficking and prostitution. The Dubs scheme represents an opportunity to provide a safe route and sanctuary to a small number of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is disappointing and we feel, unjustified to see the UK Government withdrawing its commitment to even that small number...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dubs scheme is supported by our Welsh Government as an opportunity to welcome more vulnerable child refugees to Wales. The people of Wales have strong humanitarian instincts and a proud record promoting the rights of children, as well as offering sanctuary to refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Theresa May is scrapping a scheme set up specifically to rescue refugee children in Europe - the most desperate and vulnerable people on our continent... She should scrap her Government's plans to abandon child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Westminster has been far too reluctant to act throughout this humanitarian crisis. Canada, a country with half the population of the UK took over 35,000 Syrian refugees in 2016 alone. Germany took around 300,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UK's commitments are shameful by comparison. These desperate children are alone in a foreign country seeking shelter from war, persecution and famine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Minister Carwyn Jones has written to Theresa May and asked her to reverse the decision, stating the Welsh Government is &quot;currently investing &pound;350,000 in building social services capacity to ensure additional places for unaccompanied asylum seeking children can be identified&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the Welsh Local Government Association said the umbrella group for Wales' councils had not been informed of the UK Government's plans to close the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Welsh Councils across all parts of Wales have been working hard to resettle refuges as part of the UK contribution to the current humanitarian crisis. The Home Office is operating a number of Schemes and Programmes and authorities will decide the level of their participation dependent upon a number of local factors, such as capacity, resources and ability to assist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A significant number of unaccompanied and vulnerable children and young people have been resettled in Wales over the recent period, some arriving with their families under the Syrian Resettlement Scheme or the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More recently following UK Government commitments, a smaller number of children have been resettled under the Dubs Amendment and following the closure of the 'Jungle' camp in Calais. Each placement must be made with the best interest of the child as an underpinning principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were not previously aware of the UK Government's plan to close this scheme and conversations with authorities are continuing as to any additional capacity or placements they may be able to identify for unaccompanied asylum seeking children from Europe. We are also working closely with Welsh Government in discussing how we could further develop our approach in Wales to supporting vulnerable children arriving and their integration into local communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK Government insists &quot;not giving up on vulnerable children who are fleeing conflict and danger&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It argues that in the last fortnight &quot;more than 300 refugees have arrived in the UK&quot; and &quot;around half of these were children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government says &quot;more than 8,000 children&quot; found &quot;shelter, security and safety&quot; here in the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds it is committed to resettling up to 3,000 vulnerable children and their families from the Middle East and North Africa and 20,000 Syrian refugees by the end of this parliament.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump has attempted to correct a mistake he made on Saturday that saw him overstate the number of refugees who have arrived in the US from the countries listed on his blocked travel ban.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president turned to his favorite medium, Twitter, shortly before 7am on Sunday morning to fire off the fix up. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'72% of refugees admitted into U.S. (2/3 -2/11) during COURT BREAKDOWN are from 7 countries: SYRIA, IRAQ, SOMALIA, IRAN, SUDAN, LIBYA &amp; YEMEN,' he tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 1,049 people entered the US from those countries between February 3 and 11, according to Fox News.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria had the most with 402, and Iraq had 340, while 115, 155, and 37 people entered the country from Iran, Somalia, and Sudan respectively.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's message from the president came after he appeared to have wrongly said on Saturday that 77 per cent of all refugees who have come into the US since he ban was blocked by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals were from the seven countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Our legal system is broken! &quot;77% of refugees allowed into U.S. since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries.&quot; (WT) SO DANGEROUS!' he tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president appeared to be referencing a Washington Times  article that included the figure, before explaining how the influx is mostly refugees being rescheduled who were denied entry while the ban was enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the ban was lifted, 64 per cent of refugees said they are Muslim compared to 31 percent in the first few weeks of Trump's presidency.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This makes sense considering the State Department is making up for cancelled travel plans for people from the seven Muslim majority countries.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department told the Times in a statement: 'rescheduling those whose travel had been suspended the previous week.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the reasons Trump did not mention the reason for the increase or include a link to the full article could be because it echoes the sentiments of many of his opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his travel ban was not the only thing on Trump's mind on Sunday morning, with the president firing out a series of tweets in a burst from the Mar-A-Lago resort.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one tweet he somewhat redundantly referred to a crackdown on 'illegal criminals'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers &amp; others are being removed!' he wrote.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a following tweet, he wrote: 'I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls. He's not smart enough to run for president!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tweet came after Cuban warned CEOs to be careful about how they deal with Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Do what you think is right. Be an American citizen first,' he told the Star-Telegram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In the bigger scheme of things, our country benefits from peaceful activism a lot more than it benefits from one more shoe being sold, or one more basketball ticket being sold, for that matter.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's claim that Cuban supported him also appears to be incorrect, as the Dallas Mavericks owner endorsed Hillary Clinton during the election and has been a vocal critic of the president's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of Trump's social media sparring came after it was announced the federal appeals court that refused to reinstate President's Donald Trump's travel ban will vote on whether to have a larger panel of judges reconsider the ruling.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief judge of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Sidney Thomas, announced Friday that one of the court's judges had requested the vote. The judge was not named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A three-judge panel of the court a day earlier rejected the Trump administration's motion to immediately reinstate the travel ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 9th Circuit vote will determine whether an 11-judge panel of the court reconsiders the administration's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A majority of the court's 25 active judges would have to vote in favor of rehearing the case. That prospect was not likely.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus Island detention centre is on high alert after a botched deportation attempt on two asylum seekers on Thursday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 4am and 5am, up to 10 Papua New Guinea police, accompanied by Wilson Security guards, attempted to take two Nepalese asylum seekers for forced deportation. One was taken for deportation, the other escaped and is in hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the men have been given &quot;negative&quot; assessments by PNG's immigration authority, that is, they were found not to meet the threshold of a &quot;well-founded fear of persecution' required for refugee status.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nepalese asylum seekers held on Manus Island have reportedly come under significant pressure to return to their homeland voluntary. Some have reportedly been offered up to $20,000 to go back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Deportation of Iranian refugee from Fiji an act of thuggery, says lawyer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five voluntarily returned last week. It's understood about 12 Nepalis remain in the detention centre. Most have been there more than three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PNG government announced this week it was finalising travel documents for deportation of the first 60 of 168 people in the centre found not to be refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PNG acting chief migration officer, Solomon Kantha, said it was a step in the process of closing the centre, as ordered by the PNG supreme court last year, the Post Courier reported on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will not be resettled in PNG. Voluntary departure is encouraged and supported with an assisted voluntary return program administered by the International Organisation for Migration,&quot; said Kantha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Non-refugees who do not elect to depart voluntarily will have their departure enforced, consistent with PNG domestic legislation and our international obligations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kantha said the forced removal of the 60 people would begin in the next few weeks, &quot;continuing on a regular basis&quot; for the others as documents were organised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half of the 168 men inside the detention centre who have been denied refugee status are from Iran, a country that refuses to accept the forced return of its citizens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian refugee and journalist on Manus Island, said: &quot;This morning at 4am, PNG police and immigration attacked Mike compound and woke up two Nepali guys to deport. They took one of them while he was crying and the other one escaped and now is lost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know where they are now. The Nepalese asylum seekers were under a lot of pressure for a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boochani said the entire detention centre - currently holding more than 800 men across four compounds - was nervous about future forced deportations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration officials have returned to the compounds to hand down further negative assessments Thursday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People with negative status are in shock and they are trying to know what exactly will happen. The prison is in shock. It is too much scary for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men's lawyer, Ben Lomai, said the deportations should be halted until major issues with the assessment process had been addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Close Manus and Nauru, bring refugees here say 70 organisations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a concern that some of them, not all of them but some of them or even a few of them may not have been assessed properly,&quot; he told the ABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens senator Nick McKim accused the PNG authorities of having &quot;trashed the human rights of detainees who remain Australia's moral and legal responsibility in the context of international law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKim told the Senate on Thursday morning the deportations and alleged threats by private guards &quot;that they would be back to take them out later&quot; was further inflaming tensions at the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want to see violence in these centres but I do have to say tensions are running very hot in the Lobrum centre,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney general, George Brandis, responded the men authorities attempted to deport were not refugees and their rights were not being violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am advised that every single individual subject to these removal proceedings is a person whose claim to refugee status has been processed and rejected,&quot; said Brandis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country to which they make that claim has every right under international law to return them to their country of origin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection has been contacted for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry asylum seekers who allegedly burnt down a refugee camp in Germany found it &quot;funny&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shock claim was made by a staff member of DRK, during an hour of testimony at Dusseldorf's regional court on February 3.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described how the refugees found it &quot;funny&quot; when the hall court fire on June 7 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the blaze took hold after the asylum seekers had made multiple death threats towards DRK staff in the run up to the blaze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff endured taunts of: &quot;Damn Germans, a***holes!&quot;, &quot;we will turn the hall into ruins&quot;, or &quot;we will set fire to you, kill you all...and burn down the hall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the witness, an employee of DRK, staff had been handing out food on the day of the fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He saw the two suspects - Adel Z. and Mohammed B - in a celebratory mood following the fire in the Dusseldorf exhibition hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee camp had burnt down on June 7, 2016,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other residents, who were standing around with packed suitcases, also &quot;thought it was funny and great.&quot; One had even filmed the blaze with his smartphone.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the judge asked whether he thought the inhabitants knew about the fire ahead of time, the 57-year-old said, &quot;of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adel Z, a 27-year-old Algerian Muslim, is accused of setting the hall on fire because he was outraged that food and drinks were given to non-fasting roommates during Ramadan.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other suspect, Mohamad B, a 27-year-old Moroccan, is accused of persuading Adel Z. to set the fire because he too was dissatisfied with the accommodation in the exhibition hall.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court heard that on the day of the fire, Adel Z. and Mohamed B. were seen arguing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other residents were also quarrelling because they wanted more food but were denied it because of Ramadan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several residents at the refugee camp threatened to kill aid workers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eyewitness said: &quot;There were quarrels, because some residents wanted to have more food, certain things that, because of Ramadan, were only available in the evening&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then recalled seeing both suspects milling around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed B then &quot;went towards the middle of the hall&quot; and just six minutes later the fire alarm sounded and he saw a column on fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he added that &quot;this was not the first time someone had set a fire,&quot; so an employee searched for the fire extinguishers but they were not in the right place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He watched as someone opened a door and a draft caused two thirds of the hall to catch fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was then that he escaped along with many of the residents, half a dozen of which had packed their suitcases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eyewitness added that there had regularly been fights about the food as the inhabitants had not been accustomed to a European diet and were often angry about it.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Certain people got more violent with the beginning of Ramadan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed B allegedly said that he would &quot;rather eat nothing than eat this food,&quot; according to the witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the second witness, a 57-year-old social worker, told the court that the refugee camp was full of &quot;criminals, psychopaths and petty criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described how the police had &quot;been there every other day&quot;. And he said a colleague told him there was an &quot;extreme riot&quot; the day before the fire between fasting and non fasting residents.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that colleagues were &quot;threatened&quot; on the day of the fire after the red cross promised a warm lunch after comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this did not happen and it angered the residents as they were only given bread and sausages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the fire, neither witness was offered help to deal with what happened by DRK or the Refugee Commissioner Miriam Koch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the eyewitnesses is now seeking psychiatric help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of the suspects have been held in jail since January 16 at the 3rd Grand Prison Chamber of the D&uuml;sseldorf regional court.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In tragic scenes echoing the death of the three-year-old Alan Kurdi in 2015, which ignited global calls for asylum seekers to be granted safety, a boy's body was found by authorities on the shoreline in Cadiz.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said the two brothers, aged five and eight, died of either hypothermia or suffocation in a packed dinghy launched from the Libyan port of Zuwara over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were with their two sisters, aged 10 and 14, and all were travelling from the Ivory Coast in an attempt to reach their father in France.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unacceptable that children like these are dying while trying to reach Europe by sea. This year, crossings of the Mediterranean have continued throughout the winter because of the increasingly dangerous and unbearable conditions that migrants face in Libya every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities have warned that thousands of refugees remain at risk in poor shelter and extreme weather conditions across Europe, where many have been stranded by travel restrictions and closing borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dire situation comes after Donald Trump provoked international condemnation by freezing the US refugee programme and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim &quot;countries of concern&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the US resettlement program is one of the most important in the world,&quot; the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and IOM said in a joint statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two agencies cautioned against proposals by the President to prioritise asylum claims by Christians - a move that could violate international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boat crossings over the Aegean Sea have dramatically decreased since the EU-Turkey deal was struck in March, which has resulted inanyone arriving in theGreek islands detained under threat of deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But voyages over the longer and more treacherous Central Mediterranean, now the deadliest crossing in the world, have continued throughout the winter, as well as journeysfrom North Africa to Spain to the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 5,500 migrants have arrived by sea in Europe so far this year, according to UNHCR figures, in unseaworthy rubber dinghies and overloaded wooden fishing boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the 4,200 asylum seekers arriving in Italy are from African countries including Nigeria and Eritrea, while around 1,200 reaching Greece were predominantly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the world reacts to President Trump's decision to restrict access to America for some Muslims including Syrian refugees, commentators are drawing parallels with the plight of Jews fleeing persecution by the Nazis on the eve of World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many are familiar with the plight of young diaristAnne Frank and her family, who hid in anAmsterdam attic for three years before they were sent to the gas chambers, fewer people are aware of their desperate, doomed attempt to enter the US in 1941.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anne father,Otto Frank tried in vain to obtain visas to the US, a convoluted and protracted process revealed in nearly 80 pages of documents unearthed by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in 2007.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump's does not put 'America first' says Holocaust survivor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Franks had high-level connections in American business and political circles, this was not enough to secure safe passage for the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Otto Frank's efforts to get his family to the United States ran foul of restrictive American immigration policies designed to protect national security and guard against an influx of foreigners during time of war&quot;, wrote American University history professor Richard Breitman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Frank family included fatherOtto,motherEdith and sisters Margot and Anne, who would be87 if she was alive today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, shewas killed by the Nazis at the age of 15 at the Bergeb-Belsen concentration camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1941, the Frank family had been forced to flee Germany for the Netherlands, from where Mr Frank made the fruitless visa applications for the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump: 'America first, America first'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see USAis the only country we could go to,&quot; Mr Frank wrote in a letter to a friend on April 30, 1941.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps you remember that we have two girls. It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for. Our own fate is of less importance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By early 1939, more than 300,000 names were on the waiting list for a US visa, according to Professor Beitman's research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to this, the US tightened its immigration protocol and stopped granting visas unless transportation to the country had already been booked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tough new rules meant the Franks could not get visas if they had any remaining close relatives in Germany because of fearsrefugees might act as spies if their relatives were pressured by the Nazis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Ambassador to Cuba, George Messersmith wrote in May 1940: &quot;Among the so-called refugees in our country is a fair number who can be depended upon to act as agents of their government and who will violate in any way the hospitality which they are enjoying among us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such restrictions would have meant the entire Frank family would have had to get US visas, or none would qualify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paperwork reveals a series of hold-ups with the family's visa applications - which were eventually destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has carried recent editorials claiming the comparison between Jewish and Syrian refugees is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of polls conducted in the US in the build-up to Word War II showed the American public was broadly against the arrival of refugees from Europe, the majority of whom were Jews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said in its 2015 editorial: &quot;Jews were viewed as harbingers of dangerous ideologies, particularly communism and anarchism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were pronounced fears that fifth columnists and spies would infiltrate the country through the tide of refugees fleeing fascist Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump has suspended refugee admissions to the US for 120 days as part of measures he claimed would &quot;keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He issued an executive order which banned Syrian refugees indefinitely until &quot;significant changes&quot; are made, and halved the annual cap on refugees to 50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order will affect people from &quot;countries of particular concern&quot;, which is expected to include Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE captured triumph and joy, tragedy and disaster, and put himself under the lens in an astonishing final assignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After four decades travelling the globe, revered Sunday Mirror photo journalist John Alevroyiannis documented his own battle against cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a fight he would not win. We lost our brave colleague, just 61, last Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And today we are proud to show a few of his memorable pictures - plus the poignant last photo of his extraordinary life.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affectionately known as John The Greek, he captured the most remarkable moments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the first kiss between newlyweds Prince William and Kate to the reunion between a Syrian refugee and his daughter, John's pictures brought the world to life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made his subjects totally relaxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Princess Diana was always happy to pose for him because he called her &quot;Sweetie&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vicky Balch, 21, who lost a leg in the Alton Towers rollercoaster crash, beamed happily - while BGT favourites Stavros Flatley shared a chuckle with kindred spirit John.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once, while covering a day in the life of a maternity ward in Croydon, he emerged in surgical scrubs having persuaded a couple to let him photograph the entire labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warzones and refugee camps were John's regular stomping ground and he was fearless in his pursuit of the perfect frame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He infiltrated a dog-fighting gang and ended up with two pitbulls called Bonehead and Molly that ran amok in the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one of his most memorable moments came a couple of years ago when he managed to coax cancer-stricken Ashya King, then five, to take his first steps since controversial proton treatment in Prague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporter Patrick Hill said: &quot;John began taking photos to relax Ashya, before exclaiming in trademark style, 'I have got an idea'. What followed was remarkable. With John's encouragement, and his mum and dad's support, Ashya stepped down from his bed and took his first steps in two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a moment his thrilled parents genuinely thought they may never see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUNPOINT John and wife Sarah were once held at gunpoint in Mozambique as he tried to get the perfect shot of Prince Harry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hastily stuffed five cameras into a toilet cubicle and sweet-talked the local militia into letting them go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not his first extraordinary risk in the line of duty. But he could not survive his last assignment after being diagnosed with stage four lung cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From his first day of chemotherapy, to a snap taken days before he died, he was determined to keep a pictorial record. Even after he left theatre having had a 10-hour operation he insisted on a picture of him getting to his feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week he walked up a corridor before doing a Greek jig. But hours later sepsis took over his system and he suffered multi-organ failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John started out on an Athens news agency and came to the UK in 1981. He had two sons - Alexander and Nikolas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wife Sarah said: &quot;He adored people and his only fear was dying alone. That never happened. His loved ones held his hand and were by his side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John's pal Mark Moylan, the Sunday Mirror's head of pictures, said: &quot;His passion was his job, it was his life. He was the ultimate professional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And borrowing one of John's Greek expressions - meaning &quot;cheers!&quot; - Mark added: &quot;Stini yassou, John!&quot; gemma.aldridge@trinitymirror.com</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">East Twickenham Centennial Group has received &pound;8,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to tell the exciting story of the &quot;Belgian Village on the Thames&quot; formed by 6000 Belgian refugees in Richmond and Twickenham in the First World War.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to National Lottery players, the project will&nbsp;revive this forgotten story for today's residents of Richmond upon Thames. It begins on Saturday 1st April with a public event and exhibition for local residents, London Belgians and refugee descendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the following two years, it will continue its research via The National Archives in Kew and take the Belgian refugee story around and about the Borough through talks, walks and children's workshops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To mark the Centenary of the First World War, the project will bring refugee descendants from across UK and Belgium to share their family memories with local residents.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project Lead Helen Baker has already met 95-year old Edouard (&quot;Teddie&quot;) Labeye whose refugee father married English Nellie Hammerton of the famous Twickenham watermen family (photo above).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More volunteers will collect old photos, newspaper clippings, documents, photograph family keepsakes and&nbsp;other volunteers will trawl individual Belgian record cards held at The National Archives to create an online database of individual refugees with their local addresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim is to re-create a picture of what the functioning &quot;Belgian Village &quot; was like. Trained by experts, volunteers themselves will learn a range of new skills from archive research through event management to museum work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Richmond and Twickenham Belgian community was unique. Like many other Belgian communities, it was created by a munitions factory offering employment. But less than a handful of towns in the UK had so many Belgians, and none of these were created by independent Belgian businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Twickenham-Richmond set-up created a genuine community where Belgians from all walks of life lived together as they might in Belgium.<BR>With help from professionals, the information gathered will be digitally recorded and an on-line interactive archive will be created where everyone can access and contribute information. The archive will allow the public to discuss, contribute, share and research information about the Home Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helen Baker, East Twickenham Centennial Chair, said&nbsp; &quot;We are so thrilled to receive the Heritage Lottery Fund support. We have been so excited to re-discover the story of our First World War Belgian refugees, and this will help us share it with everyone across the Borough to make sure it is never forgotten again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Hobley, Head of HLF London, said: &quot;The impact of the First World War was far reaching, touching and shaping every corner of the UK and beyond. Thanks to National Lottery players, the Heritage Lottery Fund has already been able to invest more than &pound;83.5 million into more than 1,650 projects - large and small - that are marking this global Centenary. With this funding we are enabling even more communities like those involved in the 'Belgian Refugee project' to explore the continuing legacy of this conflict and help people to broaden their understanding of how it has shaped our modern world&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We don't want them here,' he said as military brass assembled applauded in the Pentagon's 'Hall of Heroes.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We want to make sure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,' Trump said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House waited more than two hours to release the final executive order, acting after DailyMail.com published a photograph taken Thursday aboard Air Force One that appeared to show most of one page on the president's desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order declares that U.S. policy is 'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         'EXTREME VETTING'                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order provides a list of possible mechanisms for 'vetting' prospective immigrants and catching those 'seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it gives the Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order stops the State Department's entire U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days - and declares that refugees from Syria are not welcome until further notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that period of time, refugees will be accepted only from countries that the State and Homeland Security Departments decide are safe to work with.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft document on Trump's Air Force One desk referred to 'countries designated by Congress to pose a risk to national security.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights activists feared that the Trump administration aimed to end large portions of America's refugee resettlement program, particularly targeting displaced persons in terror-prone Middle Eastern nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Trump signed the order, he read along: 'This is &quot;the protection of the nation from foreign terrorists' entry into the United States&quot;.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We all know what that means,' he said, adding moments later: 'That's big stuff.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's directives to DHS includes a demand for twice-yearly publication of statistics about terrorism in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those include how many foreign nationals have been charged with terror offenses or deported for terrorism or other national security reasons. Also on the list is the number of&nbsp;foreign nationals 'who have been radicalized after entry into the United States.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Trump is also ordering the agency to track 'acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump was at the Pentagon to oversee a ceremonial swearing-in of James Mattis as secretary of defense. The retired U.S. Marine Corps general formally took his oath of office a week ago, following quick Senate approval on Inauguration Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's critics immediately framed the 'vetting' order as the real-world incarnation of a December 2015 campaign promise to bring about 'a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on' with terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That position is still on Trump's presidential&nbsp; campaign website. In subsequent months Trump backed off that promise, saying his intention was a nation-specific halt to the entry of people who presented a high risk of harboring nefarious intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called it a philosophy of 'extreme vetting,' and railed against Democrat Hillary Clinton for wanting to expand the Obama-era refugee program by 550 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Rescue Committee (IRC) called the suspension of the U.S. resettlement program a 'harmful and hasty' decision that would impact thousands of innocent people - 'mostly women and children.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'America has the strongest, most successful resettlement program in the world,' said IRC President and CEO David Miliband. 'Certified by successive administrations, the U.S. resettlement program makes it harder to get to the United States as a refugee than any other route. This is one of many reasons to deplore the hasty decision made today.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobel laureate Malala&nbsp;Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist for female education, said in a statement that she was 'heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yousafzai noted the plight of 'Syrian refugee children, who have suffered through six years of war by no fault of their own,' and said they were being 'singled-out for discrimination.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas congressman, said that the U.S. is 'a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants. But as we know, terrorists are dead set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan Horse to attack us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump expressed surprise during his White House run that Muslim refugees find an easier route to acceptance in the U.S. than Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told CBN News on Friday that his administration would do the reverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are going to help them,' he said. 'They've been horribly treated.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And the reason that was so unfair - everybody was persecuted, in all fairness - but they were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order declares that the U.S. will 'prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that only applies when 'the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by Danish leading privately-owned independent newspaper Politiken website, on 1 January</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Report by Kristian Corfixen: &quot;Queen in New Year Speech: Refugees Must Understand Where They Have Arrived&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influx of refugees was at the top of the speaking notes Queen Margrethe brought with her to the reception room at Christian IX Palace in Amalienborg this evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;War and poverty have caused many to flee, including to Denmark,&quot; the sovereign stated initially.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We care for people who need help,&quot; the queen then continued. And then came the message that will probably be what the New Year speech, the queen's 45th, will be remembered for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will help the refugees get settled, but we must also impose demands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have expectations from their new existence -- and we also have expectations from them. The refugees must understand where they have arrived: in a country where not only the climate is completely different, but where the way of life and customs are different and have a long history and deep roots. It's not easy to settle into a foreign country. It's hard work, it requires good will and an open mind,&quot; were the words of Queen Margrethe II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A message with overtones from last year, when the queen in a much-discussed interview with Berlingske said that Danish society, which receives many people from outside, could very well &quot;impose the requirement that they understand where they have arrived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sovereign put into words &quot;the scepticism that may develop when new, large refugee streams come to the country.&quot; A scepticism that new Danes, who have otherwise worked hard to learn the language and Danish traditions, could &quot;for good reason&quot; be nervous about affecting them, the queen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they should not suffer if others do not make the same effort to become part of the Danish community,&quot; the queen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Precisely that, being part of the Danish community, has major significance. It's not something you can demand, but it's something that comes almost unnoticed, gradually. That's where &quot;they&quot; become &quot;we&quot; and &quot;they&quot; become &quot;us&quot; -- the Danes, us Danes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Does It Mean To Be Danish?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the major topics of debate in 2016 has been: what does it mean to be Danish?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The word &quot;Danishness&quot; was chosen as the word of the year by a panel of judges on Denmark's Radio, Channel 1. And over the course of the year politicians and social debaters have lined up to give their takes. Queen Margrethe also picked up on the subject in the first minutes of her speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What does it mean to be Danish? Do we need to be Danish? Does nationality even have any meaning in the modern, industrialized, global society?&quot; asked her majesty in front of the camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a question to ask!&quot; she then declared, looking into the camera lens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are Danes, of course, but we are also different. We have a different background, we are raised differently. We come from a big city, we come from a small community, but each of us knows that we are Danish. That is part of our identity. We may feel it most strongly when we return from a long trip: the signs are Danish -- and the license plates -- the weather. Well, that's what we are familiar with. The language -- yes, that's part of us. We have heard it and spoken it since infancy. It's the joy of recognition we feel. That, just as much as our habits and customs, is part of being Danish,&quot; the queen replied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Tim Murgatroyd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it just me who wonders whether the UK is punching way, way below its weight when it comes to helping lone child refugees? I seriously ask myself whether we couldn't squeeze a few more into our own fair city of York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First off, some context. Remember David Cameron? Ah, how fragile are the mighty in the end. You might even wonder why we give them so much power over our lives . . . But I digress.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in May last year our then Prime Minister announced with some fanfare that the UK would accept an unspecified number of lone child refugees. He was responding to public outcry that tens of thousands such children were adrift in the continent of Europe, potential prey to exploitation and abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank goodness for that, millions of Britons told themselves. Remember, our country has a proud record of helping child refugees from Nazi Germany through the famous Kindertransports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assumption by campaigners was that at least 3,000 would be swiftly accommodated here, spread out across our 600 or so local authorities. A far greater cause for national pride, in my humble view, than gold medals at an Olympics or even winning Eurovision - if Brexiters still allow us to enter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions, as everyone knows, speak louder than words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, many of us believe that British foreign policy in Iraq and Libya actually contributed to the destabilising of the Middle East and increased the flow of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long way from home:&nbsp;A Syrian refugee child plays with a ball in a settlement camp in Koura, Lebanon. &nbsp;Photo: Jane Barlow/PA Wire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selling British-made arms to war-bent states with big enough bank accounts isn't a sensible road to world peace either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, war and crises of many kinds, not least environmental, are driving people to flee all they know and care for, their communities and homes, risking their own and their family's lives, just to find a place of safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How easy it is for us in York to take our personal security for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, for example, I heard a racket of military jets over the city and stepped outside. High up, warplanes from the RAF were clearly practising some kind of attack on an urban site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air filled with the rasping, hoarse roar of engines. The planes circled then sped off, presumably having simulated depositing their payload and fleeing before any retaliation could come their way. All sound military tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being an imaginative sort (I am a novelist, after all), I found myself picturing the scene if those war jets hadn't been RAF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What would happen if they had dropped barrel bombs, napalm, or any of the other hideous aerial weapons mankind has designed to mangle one another?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I imagined the ancient wooden-framed houses around the Minster burning, smoke billowing into the air. And if those air attacks were followed by ruthless enemies on land, wouldn't I want to flee to a place of safety, a place with a tradition of civil society and the rule of law like . . . Oh yes, York?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings me back to David Cameron's pledge to accept a large number of lone child refugees into our country. Indeed, to show the world that we in the UK are genuinely compassionate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because I'm sad to say neither of those things are happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turns out from official government figures that only 200 lone child refugees have been accepted so far. Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, has told MPs only one further group of 150 lone child refugees are to be brought to Britain and they will be the last to be transferred under the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Am I the only one who thinks that we can afford to do far, far better than that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know City of York Council is cash-strapped by Government austerity targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the wealthy in this country paid their fair share of taxes I'm sure we could find the means to support vulnerable child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it just me who would welcome such young people to our city as an asset for the future, not a burden?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Britain wants to be great, we need greatness of soul and heart, not a shameful meanness of spirit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A six-year-old boy washed up on a Spanish beach and two young brothers trying to reach their father in France are among the child refugees dying in desperate journeys across the Mediterranean as Europe continues to turn its back on their plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In tragic scenes echoing the death of three-year-old Alan Kurdi in 2015, which ignited global calls for asylum seekers to be granted safety, a boy's body was found by authorities on the shoreline in Cadiz.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its state of decomposition led Spanish authorities to believe he was among a group of at least six migrants from sub-Saharan Africa who drowned a fortnight ago while trying to cross the Strait of Gibraltar.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two more children died over the weekend as they attempted to cross the treacherous Central Mediterranean between Libya and Italy with their siblings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said the two brothers, aged five and eight, died of either hypothermia or suffocation in a packed dinghy launched from the Libyan port of Zuwara over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were with their two sisters, aged 10 and 14, who were travelling from the Ivory Coast in an attempt to reach their father in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A French naval ship took around 150 survivors from West African countries including Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Guinea to shore in Trapani, Italy, and transferred to a shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crossing the Mediterranean is always dangerous for migrants, but at this time of year the sea conditions and the cold weather can be lethal, particularly for small children,&quot; said Federico Soda, director of the IOM coordination office for the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unacceptable that children like these are dying while trying to reach Europe by sea. This year, crossings of the Mediterranean have continued throughout the winter because of the increasingly dangerous and unbearable conditions that migrants face in Libya every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another dead body was brought ashore in Sicily by &quot;Diciotti&quot; rescue ship, with asylum seekers on board the dinghy saying two people fell overboard during the attempted crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remains of a Nigerian woman were also found among more than 204 migrants brought to the Italian island of Lampedusa on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 254 refugees have died in crossings over the Mediterranean so far this year, drowning or dying of suffocation and hypothermia following a record 5,000 deaths in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     More asylum seekers have died on land in the continent they hoped would offer them safety, including victims of the freezing conditions gripping much of Europe this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-month old baby died at the Ritsona refugee camp in Greece on Friday, a day after being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors in Chalkida recommended a referral to a hospital in Athens but the parents returned to the camp, believing an ambulance would be sent after an apparent translation issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Greek island of Lesbos, where the navy sent a ship to provide emergency accommodation after tents were buried in snow earlier this month, three men havedied in recentdays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 20-year old Pakistani man was found dead in his tent early on Tuesday morning in the Moria detention camp, where a 46-year-old Syrian man was found dead on Saturday. It followed the death of a 22-year-old Egyptian man last week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities have warned that thousands of refugees remain at risk in poor shelter and extreme weather conditions across Europe, where many have been stranded by travel restrictions and closing borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dire situation comes after Donald Trump provoked international condemnation by freezing the US refugee programme and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim &quot;countries of concern&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the US resettlement program is one of the most important in the world,&quot; the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and IOM said in a joint statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two agencies cautioned against proposals by the President to prioritise asylum claims by Christians - a move that could violate international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boat crossings over the Aegean Sea have dramatically decreased since the EU-Turkey deal was struck in March, seeing anyone arriving on Greek islands detained under threat of deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But voyages over the longer and more treacherous Central Mediterranean, now the deadliest crossing in the world, have continued throughout the winter, as well as journeysfrom North Africa to Spain to the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 5,500 migrants have arrived by sea in Europe so far this year, according to UNHCR figures, in unseaworthy rubber dinghies and overloaded wooden fishing boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the 4,200 asylum seekers arriving in Italy are from African countries including Nigeria and Eritrea, while around 1,200 reaching Greece were dominantly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women, girls and people fleeing war and persecution will bear the brunt of far-reaching US policy changes likely to be ushered in under Donald Trump, potentially jeopardising the lives of millions of vulnerable people around the world, aid agencies have warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Population Fund and Save the Children are among international organisations braced for Trump to sign leaked executive orders that would have a major impact on funding to the UN and support for US refugee resettlement programmes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'Global gag rule': stop playing politics with women's lives, MSF tells Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the leaked orders directly targets any UN agency involved in programmes that support or fund abortion as a method of family planning. The UNFPA estimates that the loss of funding for even one year would prevent the delivery of sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence services to 9 million people in humanitarian settings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we do lose up to $76m [&pound;61m], which is what America provides, it will certainly have great implications for the work that we do around the world,&quot; said UNFPA executive director Babatunde Osotimehin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, US contributions to UNFPA core resources accounted for 7% of all core contributions to the organisation. The funding prevented an estimated 320,000 unintended pregnancies, 100,000 unsafe abortions and 10,000 maternal deaths or cases of long-term disability, said the UNFPA. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History does not augur well. Funding to the UNFPA was cut for all eight years under George W Bush, the entire span of his presidency. While other donor countries were able to fill in the gaps then, Osotimehin expressed concern that the needs of the world were now too great - and the resources too few - to satisfactorily meet demand in such circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course we are worried: the world has changed,&quot; he said. &quot;When you look at the sustainable development goals, they're far more than what we pushed for in those days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I worry that we might lose out if [the Trump administration] goes forward with this, and that the women and girls and young people who actually need our assistance around the world - I worry we may not be able to meet their needs. Even now, if you take the 2015 resources which we have, it's not enough to do all the work that we do. So losing any part of it is going to be a challenge going forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osotimehin said he had already held preliminary talks with European, Latin American and Asian governments about filling the expected US funding gap. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the UNFPA's work takes place in refugee camps, providing much-needed family planning assistance and maternal healthcare. In Jordan's Zaatari camp, the world's biggest for Syrian refugees, the agency has helped deliver 7,000 babies without a single maternal death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those living in such camps could now suffer a double blow, with support for USAid-funded family planning clinics cut even as the chances of obtaining US refugee status severely decrease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having already signed off on a US-Mexico border wall earlier this week, Trump is now expected to sign additional executive orders banning refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East, including Syria, Iraq and Iran. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, Trump said the order targets &quot;people [who] are going to come in and cause us tremendous problems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our country has enough problems without allowing people to come in who, in many cases or in some cases, are looking to do tremendous destruction,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's comments were rebutted by Carolyn Miles, president of Save the Children USA, who said the majority of those seeking shelter are children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugee children have been terrorised. They are not terrorists,&quot; she said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality is that the US refugee resettlement programme saves lives - namely of women and children under 12, who make up 67% of the Syrian refugees in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than half of all refugees are children, whose only chance for survival and a better future relies on access to safety. We all have a moral obligation to help.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of refugees admitted to the US has fallen by nearly half under Donald Trump when compared with the final months of Barack Obama's presidency, according to statistics released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Supreme court poised to examine Trump's travel ban</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the supreme court prepares to consider a White House appeal regarding the president's ban on refugees and travellers from six Muslim-majority countries, a DHS report published on Friday provided new insight into the state of legal immigration under the Trump administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistics, first reported by the Los Angeles Times, showed at least 13,000 refugee admissions to the US in the past three months. In Obama's last three months, that number tipped just over 25,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report pointed to an escalation of refugee intake by the Obama administration around Trump's win in the presidential election. Compared with the previous fiscal year, the period under Obama reflected an 86% year-over-year increase. Under Trump, there has been a 12% year-over-year drop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately two-thirds of refugees admitted to the US in the past three months were from five countries: Syria and Somalia, both included in the travel ban; Iraq, which was included in the first version of the ban; the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burma. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week after taking office in January, Trump signed an executive order suspending all refugee admissions to the US for 120 days and barring entry for 90 days to immigrants from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The order prompted nationwide protests amidst scenes of chaos and confusion at many major airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order was blocked in federal court. In March, a revised order removed Iraq from the list and sought to moderate language seemingly directed at Muslims. That order was also ruled against. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supreme court is expected to rule this week, in its last sitting before a summer-long hiatus. Lawyers representing the Trump administration presented their closing pitch on Wednesday, insisting the travel ban was a counterterrorism measure, within the president's authority to protect national security. Lawyers for the state of Hawaii and individual plaintiffs in Maryland filed paperwork on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal judges who blocked the bans cited harsh rhetoric employed by Trump on the campaign trail, specifically a pledge to ban all Muslims from entering the US and support for giving priority to Christian refugees, as being reflective of the intent behind his travel ban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judges also said both the administration and its supporters often employed language while defending the ban that suggested a more nefarious motivation than concern for national security. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who was a top campaign surrogate for Trump, told Fox News that Trump called him after the election to ask how he could order a Muslim ban that would pass legal muster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Trump calls immigration order 'travel ban', to rebuke from Conway's husband</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you the whole history of it: when he first announced it, he said 'Muslim ban',&quot; Giuliani said. &quot;He called me up, he said, 'Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, an internal DHS report leaked to media outlets undermined the administration's rationale by finding that citizens from the countries identified in Trump's travel ban were &quot;rarely implicated in US-based terrorism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump had been relatively quiet about the ban in recent months, only to return to the issue in the wake of the 3 June terrorist attack in London. Attacking Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major western capital city, Trump tweeted: &quot;That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tweet undermined once more the administration's insistence before the courts that the executive order is not a ban but an implementation of a policy of &quot;extreme vetting&quot;. The White House has scolded the media for by calling the order a &quot;ban&quot;, even though the characterization stemmed from Trump himself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bibi and Sara* have only known each other for two weeks, but they cling to each other like limpets: broken but bonded, sitting on the edge of communal land in Calais that, for now, they must call home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are difficult to spot initially in the woods and industrial estates near the former site of the Jungle, the point at which thousands of refugees from around the world have congregated to try to enter the UK by whatever means possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sea of young men playing football and Connect 4, they have learnt to make themselves invisible. It is their superpower, if you will. It is their only &nbsp;power: the unseen girls of t he refugee crisis, learning to survive by playing dead. Their faces are blank, their eyes empty, their expressions those of battered dolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees gather on the road  by the woods, where many of them live now the Jungle has been dismantledCredit:      Abbie Trayler-Smith     </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen months ago, when Sara was 15, her mother sold their house in war-torn Eritrea so Sara could be smuggled out to a place of safety. It is unlikely that she pictured this for her daughter: a dirty sleeping bag in a tent in some woods, shared with 20 other refugees, most of them men who claim to be protecting the 17-year-old girl. Bibi is the only other female sleeping here - for four months, she was the only woman here at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ask the 23-year-old from Ethiopia what that was like.&nbsp; 'Look at my face,' she says. It is the face of someone defeated. 'I came here for a better life, but it is almost similar.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bibi says she recently spent three days in hospital after a beating by the French police. 'When they do it here,' she says, placing her hands on both of her cheeks, 'there is no problem. But when they do it here' - she pats her abdomen - 'it is not good.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sara admitted to a member of the refugee child protection team that she had been imprisoned and repeatedly raped while seeking passage through Libya, only escaping when she became so weak that her captors flung her out on to the street, like a discarded food wrapping.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I arrive in Calais with the charity Help Refugees, it is suggested that&nbsp; I might want to talk to Sara for my story - if we can find her. The Jungle may have been squalid and at times dangerous but, as one volunteer puts it, 'there was at least a sense of community. We could keep an eye on the children. We knew where they were and we knew if they had gone missing.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the encampment was demolished last October, it has been almost impossible to keep track of the children and young adults who reside here in a sort of purgatory, refusing to lay down roots in a country they view as hostile due to the often heavy-handed actions of the riot police, but unwilling to return to their countries of birth for fear of even more punishing regimes or letting their families down.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees estimates that a third of the unaccompanied minors in the Jungle are unaccounted for since the eviction from the site. 'Kids can be much more susceptible to making dangerous decisions proposed by people who prey on their youth, inexperience and the language barrier, and claim to be able to help them,' says Philli Boyle, from the charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The rumour mill can be very powerful and plays into the hands of ill-intentioned people.' By that, she means traffickers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calais timeline</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the camp has been cleared, the migrant crisis has not gone away. It has simply been dispersed over a larger area, making it harder for the volunteers here to do their jobs. 'We have a warehouse full of donated tents we are not allowed to give out because it might encourage refugees to set down roots and start another &quot;Jungle&quot;,' says Boyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And at the same time we are struggling to keep up with demand for blankets and bedding, because almost every morning the police are pepper spraying it to force people to get up and move on.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees estimates that there are 200 unaccompanied minors in the region, most of whom are trying to make it to the UK. The chances of them doing so are slim, given the decision by Amber Rudd in February of this year to axe the Dubs Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This piece of legislation was named after Lord Dubs, the peer who campaigned for the scheme after his own experiences of coming to the UK from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia during the Second World War on the Kindertransport. The legislation promised that the UK would give sanctuary to the most vulnerable child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it was passed in May 2016, it was estimated that up to 3,000 would be helped - by the time it had ended less than a year later, just 200 children had been brought to safety. The last hope is Help Refugees' challenge to the closure of this scheme, in a judicial review this month.&nbsp; Today, even those who have a legal right to join a family member in the UK struggle to get their case heard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marwan* is a 17-year-old boy from Mosul in Iraq. He has been waiting to join his uncle in Birmingham since November. The process is long and drawn out. He spends&nbsp; his days in an accommodation centre in Dunkirk, under the care of Safe Passage, another organisation that helps unaccompanied child refugees and vulnerable adults. He is not allowed to leave, lest he go missing and try to make the dangerous crossing over the border on his own.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help Refugees knows of three children and one young woman who have died trying to make their way to England, even though they were entitled to join their families there and were already engaged in the legal process of doing so. Marwan himself has attempted to make the perilous journey several times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one occasion he snuck into a refrigerator truck full of chicken: when the border police found him, his leg was frozen to a wall. 'It is a bad, bad thing,' he tells me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have been nearly a year here, and sometimes I cannot believe that the road to England is only half an hour. You stay here for months and months and nobody talks to you. You are alone. You become crazy.' His last roommate attempted suicide just days ago.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We meet the day after the terror attack in Manchester, which claimed 22 lives. What would he say to the politicians and people who believe that all those trying to claim asylum in the UK are trouble?&nbsp;'I would say come on our journey, see what we are suffering.' He pauses, looks at his plate. 'I would say that we are running away from the same thing your children are running away from.' &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the woods surrounding a highway in&nbsp;Dunkirk, an overnight camp has just been cleared by riot police. Refugees mill around lethargically, waiting for the evening, when they can attempt to cross the border under the cloak of darkness. Every day is the same here, an almost neverending cycle of hope and despair: will this be the night that they make it to the UK without being discovered by sniffer dogs? The people here are reliant on smugglers and traffickers; they live on charity handouts and rumours of fellow migrants who have made it across the Channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find a young pregnant Iraqi lying underneath a tree with her husband. Like a modern-day Romeo and Juliet, they were threatened with death by their families for falling in love across tribal lines. The 21-year-old woman lost her first baby in labour while trying to reach Europe - she is now around four months pregnant with her second child, and clearly not well, though she refuses to go into sheltered accommodation in Dunkirk for fear of being made to seek asylum here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple tell me that, a few nights before, they hid on a truck for several hours without water. The dogs found them at the final checkpoint. 'The British officers were kind but the French police were not,' says the man. 'When my wife asked to go to the toilet, they refused her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This young girl and her family  have been living in  a container in Calais  for months on endCredit:      Abbie Trayler-Smith     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have thought about settling in France but it is such a bad situation here. We expected to be treated humanely in Europe, but it is no better than in Iraq. There, if they want to kill you, they just shoot you. Here, they slowly beat you down. We have lost everything. We are losing our minds.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the reason so many refuse to seek asylum in France - their only experiences of the authorities have been negative ones. 'It is like a bad fairy tale,' says Michael McHugh, the coordinator of the Refugee Youth Service's Child Protection Team. 'These are future citizens who should be nurtured, but instead the police try to break them with batons and tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I've heard of the authorities taking children's shoes and footballs just for the sake of it. They are living with normalised violence from the police. The UK system is much harder to get into, but it is fairer and more child-focused. They see Britain as their Willy Wonka golden ticket.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 4pm every day, volunteers from charities including Help Refugees, Refugee Community Kitchen and Gyn&eacute;cologie Sans Fronti&egrave;res travel to the 'distribution centre', a piece of scrubland near the site of the former Jungle. They hand out food and provisions to the estimated 700 migrants still in the area, including young families living in dilapidated shipping containers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is here that we finally find Sara and Bibi.&nbsp; They are wary of strangers, and don't want to talk to us. We hand them bags of toiletries and hygiene products donated by Superdrug. Suddenly they are swarmed on by male refugees who try to take the toiletries away. The translator stops them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photographer and I move closer, show Sara and Bibi what is in the bags - sanitary towels, toothbrushes, strawberry-scented shower gel. Finally, on the condition that their faces are not shown in photographs, they agree to speak.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both girls have paid in the region of (EURO)7,000 to smugglers to make it this far - their parents sold all their possessions in the hope of getting them to the UK. Neither girl knows what has become of her family. Both have experienced FGM. &nbsp;Bibi has taken on the role of protector - she worries about Sara. 'I know about boys,' she says to me. 'I was married when I was 11. At 14, I lost my baby. I have experience since then. I know that they are dangerous, that they are animals. But Sara is only 17.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her friend stares blankly into space, picking at the grass. 'All men are very dangerous,' repeats Bibi. I tell her that isn't true. 'Your husband is only good because you had his baby,' she says, sadly. 'But here, some of the other boys, the police, they all make me sleep with them.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am astonished by this claim of rape at the hands of the police, but am told by volunteers that 'protection sex' is common, whereby a woman consents to sex with someone (either a French policeman or a fellow refugee) so that she is not raped by others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shelter in the woodsCredit:      Abbie Trayler-Smith     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young boys are also at risk of this. It is not uncommon for young girls to claim that traffickers are their protectors, their older brothers. It seems almost inconceivable that all of this is happening just an hour's train journey from the UK.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Bibi and Sara want to start a new life in the UK. They too refuse to go into sheltered accommodation nearby, afraid of being made to claim asylum here - all they have seen of France &nbsp;is violence. They ask if they can show us where they are currently sleeping, and ask us not to reveal their location. 'We will be beaten for it,' they explain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girls show us the filthy tent in the woods that they share with around 19 boys. 'We protect them,' one boy says to me, as we wade through litter and discarded underwear, but I am not sure I believe him.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the afternoon wears on, it becomes clear that the girls are not safe here. The team at Gyn&eacute;cologie Sans Fronti&egrave;res tell us they can offer them three nights in a safe house, but only on the condition that they do not tell anyone where they are going and agree to turn off phone tracking on the mobiles distributed by Refugee Youth Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Traffickers often find them this way,' explains a volunteer.&nbsp; We ask Bibi and Sara if they will consider going so that they can rest safely in a proper bed with the protection of a roof and a door. The girls start to cry. 'We will go but we will not give them our fingerprints,' weeps Bibi. These are tears of both relief and fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child refugees' suffering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, I am told that the girls spent just one night in the safe house before leaving to try to reach England.&nbsp; Should Bibi and Sara get to the UK, what awaits them? A warm home, a friendly welcome, a new life? Most likely, they will end up unaccounted for, their fates erased by traffickers. They will not see their families again. They will not find safe passage. If they are very lucky, they will continue to have each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is not a definition of luck most of us would recognise. As we watch them go with Gyn&eacute;cologie Sans Fronti&egrave;res, the riot police arrive with batons and guns. They are here to clear the area, to force the refugees back into the woods. Out of sight. Out of mind.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the number of people uprooted by conflict outnumbers refugees by two to one, they have been largely ignored by the international community, according to a report by the Norwegian Refugee Council's Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  World faces worst humanitarian crisis since 1945, says UN official</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexandra Bilak, director of the IDMC, said that while resources had rightly been devoted to the refugee crisis, scant attention had been paid to people forced to resettle. &quot;Not including internal displacement as an integral part of that entire displacement and migration picture is very shortsighted, because by looking only at the point of arrival and not considering where those journeys started, inevitably you're missing part of the picture,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you redirect attention to the countries of origin and to really understanding the driving forces of these movements it would be a much more strategic approach and investment,&quot; added Bilak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, an estimated 6.9 million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of conflict and violence. Worst affected was the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 922,000 were displaced, a 50% rise on the previous year. Close behind was Syria (824,000), followed by Iraq (659,000), Afghanistan (653,000), Nigeria (501,000) and Yemen (478,000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disasters such as floods, storms and wildfires had an even greater effect, displacing 24.2 million people, more than three times the number uprooted by conflict. This trend was at its most acute in east Asia and the Pacific. In China, 7.4 million were forced from their homes, with 5.9 million affected in the Philippines and a further 2.4 million in India. Floods accounted for half of all people displaced by disasters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, a complex mix of conflict and disaster has forced communities from their homes, the report's authors noted. It pointed to the situations unfolding in Nigeria, South Sudan and Somalia, where drought combined with conflict and violence are fuelling displacement, severe food insecurity and famine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Balik said the number of displacements due to violence in DRC was proof that the underlying conflicts cannot be ignored. &quot;Unless the crisis and the factors that lead to this crisis are addressed they will re-erupt on a cyclical basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May last year, the UN proposed (pdf) that governments commit to reducing the number of internally displaced people by at least 50% by 2030. The report warned this is little more than an aspiration, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, more aid was spent on refugee resettlement within donor nations than in the countries where displacement crises originated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Yemen's food crisis: 'We are broken, we die either from bombing or hunger'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we focus on is the symptom of this breakdown of protection and human rights of people in their local communities. We just focus on the symptom, which is the people we see at our borders,&quot; said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there is a link with refugees - though the vast majority of displaced people do not have the opportunity or means to cross borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six of the 10 countries that produced the most refugees in 2015 - Afghanistan, Colombia, DRC, South Sudan and Syria - were also among the 10 with the largest number of internally displaced people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egeland warned that without political intervention the situation will only get worse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, conflict resolution needs to be redoubled, tripled, quadrupled,&quot; he said. &quot;It's incredible there's not a bigger pull towards a peaceful settlement of the Yemeni conflict. We also need to get economic life to countries like Yemen and elsewhere so there's not a collapse in social structures there. Then we need investment in avoiding environmental degradation, and we need disaster risk reduction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The level of politically-motivated crime in Germany has hit an all-time high as the left and right wing clash over the refugee crisis, terror attacks and the coming election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas de Maizi&egrave;re, the German interior minister, said total of 41,500 political crimes -4,300 of them violent - recorded last year was &quot;unacceptable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will use the full force of the law again those who reject our legal system,&quot; he added, in an apparent reference to the radical Reichsb&uuml;rger anti-government movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A reduction in the number of politically-motivated crime is not expected. Security agencies are prepared for upcoming events including the G20 meeting in Hamburg and the election campaign and will take decisive action when necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German crime figures for 2016 show the vast majority were committed by the right rather than the left, with right-wing violence up by 14 per cent and the left down by a quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee crisis is among the issues increasing tensions, with pro and anti-migrant protesters clashing at demonstrations and extremists attacking asylum seeker accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police arrest an activist during a demonstration against anti-immigration party the Alternative for Germany (AfD) before the party's conference in Cologne on 22 April (Reuters)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police car was set on fire during protests in Cologne on Saturday, as thousands of demonstrators converged on the anti-immigration Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland (AfD) party conference in Cologne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Attacks on refugee accommodation fell for the first time since 2014 last year but still stood at around 1,000 incidents, with the interior ministry calling the fact that &quot;those who have fled terror and war in their homelands are the focus of right-wing violence&quot; shocking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee shelter burnt down in Germany after dispute over Ramadan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violations of immigration law including illegal entry into Germany and overstaying visas contributed to an increase in crimes committed by foreign citizens, which rose by 4.6 per cent, constituting 40 per cent of all suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when immigration and asylum offences were excluded, the proportion of non-German suspects fell to 30 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr de Maizi&egrave;re said the &quot;disproportionate&quot; rise in crime by those classified as immigrants, including asylum seekers, refugees, illegal immigrants and people awaiting deportation, had risen to 174,4000 cases - up 53 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As unpleasant as these figures are as a whole, they validate our course, to clearly make distinctions according to each individual's need for protection,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who need no protection have no right to remain in our country, and those who commit serious crimes have forfeited their right of residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But neither will we allow all refugees living with us to be put under suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The vast majority live alongside us, with our values and the rules of a peaceful and democratic co-existence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr de Maizi&egrave;re said one reason for the high crime rate among asylum seekers and refugees - who committed 9 per cent of all offences in 2016 - was likely to be their accommodation situation, seeing fights break out in makeshift shelters and overcrowded rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right-wing political parties and movements have blamed Angela Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders to refugees in 2015 - sparking the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers - for a series of deadly terror attacks and mass sexual assaults in Cologne.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rejected Tunisian asylum seeker who Germany had attempted to deport killed 12 people in a lorry rampage at a Christmas market in Berlin. All three attacks were linked to Isis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also a significant increase in crime motivated by &quot;imported&quot; ideologies - up 66 per cent - including Isis supporters and jihadis, and over Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorist group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal prosecutors have initiated numerous cases against suspected Islamists and former foreign fighters from Isis, al-Qaedaand the Taliban, as well as against suspected spies acting on behalf of Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government in Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A referendum on expanding the President's powers has increased tensions, as well as a failed coup in July and the ongoing crackdown on Kurdish separatists, political dissidents and alleged supporters of exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When excluding immigration-related crimes, the largest group of non-German suspects were Turks, followed by Romanians, Poles and Syrians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures from the German interior ministry also showed that violent crime had increased by 7 per cent, but a spokesperson emphasised that with immigration offences excluded the overall national crime rate fell.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Home Office criteria to fill the last 150 places under the Dubs scheme to bring lone refugee children in Europe to Britain have been sharply criticised by charities and campaigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has said only children who arrived in Europe before 20 March 2016 will be eligible for the remaining places before the scheme is closed in April. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Ministers have capped the total number to be brought to Britain at 350, well below expectations of 3,000 when parliament approved Lords Dubs' amendment to the 2016 Immigration Act in May last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities say the cut-off date, when the EU deal with Turkey to stem the flow of refugees across its border came into force, will exclude the majority of the lone refugee children now in camps in Greece. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safe Passage says there are currently 2,300 unaccompanied minors - who include victims of trafficking and sexual abuse - for just 1,250 shelter places offered by the Greek authorities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office has said it will take children from France, Greece and Italy when a &quot;best interests determination&quot; has concluded it is in their best interests to be transferred to the UK rather than stay where they are, be transferred to another EU state or be reunited with family outside Europe. The three countries have been asked to confirm by the end of this month whether they are able to refer children under the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In deciding which children to refer, France, Greece and Italy will be asked to prioritise unaccompanied children who are likely to be granted refugee status in the UK and/or are the most vulnerable, due to factors which could include but are not limited to, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' Children at Risk individual risk factors. These risk factors include child victims of trafficking and sexual abuse; survivors of torture; survivors of violence; and, children with mental or physical disabilities,&quot; say the Home Office guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natasha Tsangarides, Safe Passage's Greece field manager, said: &quot;These vulnerability-led criteria are a significant improvement on the arbitrary and unfair ones used in Calais last year. That said, using the 20 March cut-off date lacks credibility and seriousness given the bill was passed in May last year and to date not one child has been transferred under its auspices from Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Of course, with government determined to wind up the programme by April, these criteria will be scant comfort to the thousands of minors for whom the Dubs amendment came as a lifeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children will once again be forced to make the terrible choice between train tracks on the one hand and people traffickers on the other. These choices are worth up to &pound;13,500 per child to the traffickers and of course will only result in the regrowth of 'the Jungle' in Calais. We appeal to the government to reconsider their decision to close this lifeline, pending further advice from the anti-slavery commissioner and local authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Dubs, appearing before the Commons international development committee, also renewed his appeal to ministers not to close the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the MPs: &quot;I don't understand why they have done it. We are talking about very small numbers. I don't understand why they have closed it down in this way. They could have easily kept it going for a bit longer. They should keep the scheme open but accept children at the speed that local authorities can take them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three males were filmed waiting on the roadside holding a Union Jack flag as they discussed their desire to leave France for a life in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calais was the home of the infamous 'Jungle' camp which housed thousands of migrants until it was bulldozed and cleared in late 2016.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to three young males, a Sky News reporter asked the trio their ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of the men said he was 17, causing the reporter to say: &quot;You look older than 17. You really are 17?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, wearing black coat with the hood up, again replied yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SKY NEW&middot;GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 17-year-old migrant in Calais was asked about his age</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of his companions, wearing a thick scarf and a&nbsp;grey&nbsp;wooden hat, was then asked the same question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said how he was just 14 and had been in Calais for a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government is facing a backlash after it performed a &quot;shocking and devastating backtrack&quot; by limiting the number of child refugees accepted into Britain under the Dubs scheme to just 350.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee charity Care4Calais warned more unaccompanied minors were&nbsp;arriving to&nbsp;bleaker-than-ever conditions in the French port town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite this, the Government announced that only a small portion of the anticipated 3,000 child refugees would be accepted into the UK from Europe under the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee crisis charity called on ministers to reverse the cap as they accused them of &quot;turning their backs&quot; on child refugees fleeing &quot;unthinkable violence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SKY NEWS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the migrants said they had been in France for a year </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the 'Jungle' camp was torn down, child refugees have been sleeping rough in the streets where they are at a heightened risk of being trafficked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sue Jex, head of UK operations at Care4Calais, said: &quot;The scheme has been in place for less than a year, during which time the UK Government has failed to take in even a third of those children who were originally considered under the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem has not gone away, refugees - including unaccompanied minors - are continuing to arrive in Calais every day, and are now living in conditions far worse than those of last year's jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would urge the Government to rethink its decision and act now to urgently bring these children to safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration minister Robert Goodwill quietly announced the cap on the Dubs scheme on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year a developed over the age of some child refugees who arrived in the UK from Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many argued the men arriving were significantly older than what they claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Tory MP warned Britain was at risk of being &quot;taken for a ride&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Davies said the row over the real ages of supposed minors being brought over from the Jungle camp was doing &quot;irreparable damage&quot; to public confidence in the asylum system and called for tougher checks.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shipley MP said he had been contacted by a &quot;large number&quot; of people who had&nbsp;said&nbsp;&quot;how angry they are that we're being taken for a ride&quot; since his fellow Tory David Davies made a proposal to make new arrivals undergo dental tests to verify their ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However,&nbsp;the Home Office ruled out calls for dental checks to verify the age of Calais migrants as it was &quot;inappropriate and unethical&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A four-year-old Somali girl was finally reunited with her family after two senators intervened on her behalf to circumvent President Trump 's travel ban.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order was signed just four days before Mushkaad Abdi was due to fly to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and her flight on January 31 was cancelled as a result.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar intervened, Abdi, who was separated from her family as an infant, arrived in the US on Thursday to the delight of her mother, Samira Dahir, and her two older sisters.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her 32-year-old mother was granted refugee status before she became pregnant with her third daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the relationship between a 'principal refugee' and a child must have existed before the refugee was admitted to the U.S. or granted asylum.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It notes specifically that a child must have been born or conceived before a refugee is allowed entry or granted asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when Dahir became pregnant after she was granted asylum, she faced a difficult decision.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She could either put her&nbsp;resettlement and that of her two older daughters on hold for several more years and re-start the process with Mushkaad, or leave the little girl behind and try to bring her to the U.S. later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dahir left her youngest daughter with a friend in Uganda and worked for years to bring her to Minnesota.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation became more urgent months ago when the friend was no longer able to care for the girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mushkaad was scheduled to arrive on January 31, but her trip was canceled by Trump's executive order banning refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exeuctive order, signed just days before the young girl's trip, suspended the admission of all refugees for 120 days, and barred travel from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar intervened and pressed Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to clear the girl's travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's been heart-wrenching for Samira and her two older daughters, who have waited to be reunited with Mushkaad since she was an infant.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I'm very pleased that after far too long of a separation, this Minnesota family is now together,' Franken said in a statement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This case proves that President Trump's Executive Order was poorly thought out, poorly executed, and above all wrong for Minnesota and the nation.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klobuchar added that the executive order caused chaos and its impact was felt by Minnesota families and businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am so glad that Mushkaad is now safe at home in the United States with her mother, Samira, and her two sisters,' she said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'However, we know that Mushkaad is not the only child who was waiting to be reunited with their family and caught up in the aftermath of this order. I will continue to advocate to help families in the state.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump on Saturday defended his tough new immigration bans, which prompted outrage as migrants were stopped from flying into the United States and refugees were held in JFK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president denied that his executive order, which bars refugees and citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the country, was a Muslim ban.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He maintained that the ban was 'working very nicely' while chaos broke out in airports as migrants were stopped and some non-American citizens realized they were now barred from the country where they were studying or had lived, perhaps for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's comments came as seven refugees bound for the US were stopped from boarding a plane in Cairo on Saturday and 12 migrants were detained in New York overnight because they arrived just after the executive order was signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's not a Muslim ban, but we are totally prepared,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Saturday afternoon, according to The Hill.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's working out very nicely. You see it in the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely and we are going to have a very, very strict ban and we are going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panic broke out after Department of Homeland Security issued a directive at 4:30 pm on Friday enforcing Trump's executive order to close down the borders to refugees and visa holders from a list of banned Muslim-majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Iran, the other countries on Trump's blacklist are Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout from Trump's immigration crackdown grew on Saturday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian director nominated for an Oscar won't be able to attend the Hollywood award ceremony due to the new immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated in the best foreign&nbsp;film category for his movie The Salesman but there are fears he may now not be able to attend next month's Academy Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His native Iran, which is where The Salesman was filmed, is one of seven countries listed in Trump's executive order that has placed a 90-day pause on visas and immigration to the US.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, tweeted on Saturday morning that&nbsp;Farhadi would be banned from attending the Oscars in what has become yet another fallout from Trump's immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Iran's Asghar Farhadi won't be let into the US to attend Oscar's. He's nominated for best foreign language film... #MuslimBan,' he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian-born actress who stars in Farhadi's The Salesman vowed to boycott the Oscars over Trump's immigration bans.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taraneh Alidoosti, the 33-year-old known as the Natalie Portman of Iran,&nbsp;took to Twitter&nbsp;with a message for fans on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest,' she tweeted.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visa ban sparked fear for some refugees who were already on their way to the U.S. when the order came into effect and were detained on arrival.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqi refugees who was detained for 14 hours at New York, was released on Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 53-year-old had arrived in America on a flight from Istanbul on Friday night, just hours after Trump implemented the immigration ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He&nbsp;had worked for the U.S. government in Iraq for 10 years as a translator, engineer and contractor and had a valid special immigration visa to relocate to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darweesh pumped his fist in the air outside the airport following his release, as a crowd of supporters cheered him on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'First of all I want to thank the people that take care of me and support me. This is the humility, this is the soul of America,' he told a crowd gathered outside the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is what pushed me to move - leave my country and come here. America is the land of freedom... America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what he thought of Trump he said: 'I don't know. He's a president, I'm a normal person.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was travelling with his wife and three children at the time but they were not detained. They were heading to Charlotte, North Carolina to start their new life in America.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Darweesh and another Iraqi Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who is still detained at JFK, filed a lawsuit on Saturday morning in a bid to have them released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men were on separate flights when immigration officials stopped them on Friday night and took their passports when they landed in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alshawi - who was approved for a visa on January 11 - was flying to America to join his wife and son in Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHO EXACTLY IS BANNED FROM THE U.S?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That covers legal permanent residents - green card holders - and visa-holders from those seven countries who were out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban.&nbsp;They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customs and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas have been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S. Airlines are being told to keep them off those flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Source: Associated Press&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven other refugees are still being held at JFK airport. Protesters gathered outside the airport on Saturday in anger over those being held in detention.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cairo airport officials said seven U.S.-bound migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's JFK airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane on Saturday after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action at Cairo airport was the first there since Trump imposed the three-month ban on refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutch airline KLM says it had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world - that these people are no longer welcome,' Manel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the seven, who were from the seven blacklisted countries, were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear how many refugees or visa holders are already being detained across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee said there was chaos at airports and in the air following Trump's ban with the organization already receiving calls for help from green card and other visa holders after being refused admission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Visas being denied immediately. Chaos at airports and in the air. #MuslimBan will apply to green card holders attempting to return tonight,' the ADC's Abed Ayoub tweeted on Friday night.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's ban puts a 90-day pause on visas and immigration from seven countries including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also puts a 120-day ban on all refugee entries into the country and declares that refugees from Syria are not welcome until further notice.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ANTI-IMMIGRATION ORDER DO?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban refugee entries from all countries for 120 days. Refugees can be accepted on case-by-case basis, including&nbsp;if they are a religious minority facing religious persecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Block refugee entries from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap refugee intake at 50,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban visa and immigration entries for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries on banned list, including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspend visa issuance to countries of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that period of time, refugees will be accepted only from countries that the State and Homeland Security Departments decide are safe to work with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as Iran's foreign ministry suggested the country would limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for Trump's suspension of immigration and visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official IRNA news agency carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry on Saturday that said Iran will resort to 'counteraction' to Trump's executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals,' the statement read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google urged its staff travelling overseas on Friday to immediately return to the U.S. if they would be affected by the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEO Sundar Pichai issued a memo slamming Trump's order saying 100 employees were affected, Bloomberg  reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech company feared its employees, even though they have valid visas, would be stopped from returning to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg hit out at Trump condemning his anti-immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that,' Zuckerberg said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows reports that Muslim-majority countries with ties to Trump's business empire have been excluded from the order,&nbsp; Bloomberg  reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics show Trump doesn't have any business relations with the seven black-listed countries, but does with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order&nbsp;declares that U.S. policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also&nbsp;gives Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year, according to the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order declares that the U.S. will 'prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution.'&nbsp;But that only applies when 'the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has an open door refugee policy and since it opened last August, it is now home to 272,000 people - more than the population of Cork, Limerick and Galway cities combined. The 3News half hour special will show Liam and Colette as they hear the personal stories from refugees who fled South Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIG BROTHER: LIVE LAUNCH 3e, 8.30pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is June 2017 and a bunch of deluded and desperate fame-hungry wannabes with controversial opinions and questionable behaviours are competing for your vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, we're not talking about the general election but the start of a new series of Big Brother. Series 437, we are unreliably informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Channel Five really is determined to flog this decaying horse for everything it's worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And apparently this time around they are aiming for a 'United Kingdom of Big Brother' theme, which - given that the country is undeniably massively divided - is either ironic, naive or just plain daft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, we all know the drill by now. A load of strange folk will be locked up in a house in Elstree, with cameras on them 24 hours a day, whilst shadowy figures behind the scenes do everything they can to get them to either hate or hump each other. Once again Emma Willis is the safe and stylish pair of hands in charge of proceedings, followed by Rylan Clark-Neal who does a brilliant job hosting Bit on the Side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosby... icon or i-con man?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSBY: FALL OF AN AMERICAN ICON BBC2, 9pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BILL Cosby truly was an American icon. Finding fame as a stand-up comedian in the 1960s, he became an Emmy award-winning actor and one of the first black performers to conquer American mainstream popular culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1980s, he was the creator and star of one of the biggest hits in television history - The Cosby Show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a series which attracted hundreds of millions of viewers globally, genuinely helped to change attitudes and turned Bill into &quot;America's dad&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was indistinguishable from his on-screen alter ego Cliff Huxtable - the perfect father, everyone's best pal or role model, a man who could do no wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he was a philanthropist, donating huge sums to worthy causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But behind the scenes in his private life, Cosby was allegedly drugging and raping women with impunity - and using his incredible fame and power to help keep it all secret. Today he is due to face trial, charged with indecent sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusations were first made by Andrea Constand in 2004, but prosecutors decided to take no further action, with the District Attorney saying it would have been a case of &quot;he said, she said&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when Andrea then took out a civil case and waived her anonymity, 13 more women came forward to claim Cosby had drugged and abused them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this, Cosby continued to be celebrated and nothing happened for a further decade, until a black stand-up comedian called Hannibal Buress openly called Cosby a rapist on stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, America finally paid attention. Dozens more women came forward, Cosby's new shows and tour were cancelled, and a new legal battle started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, as attorney Gloria Allred says: &quot;It's no longer a 'he said, she said'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It'll be a 'he said, she said, she said, she said, she said...'&quot; Pick of the day charged c</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FORMER 'Jungle' refugee camp in Calais has been closed to the public for 'health and safety reasons'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Calais Jungle has been closed over health and safety concerns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officials issued a decree on Monday in a bid to stop wanderers - notably returning and newly arrived UK-bound immigrants - from accessing the former tent camp.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decree, which is valid until the end of 2017, concerns the former shanty town's north and south zone: the south zone belongs to the state, but the north zone belongs to the coastal conservatory.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calais chiefs said that what used to be known as the 'Jungle' had been closed to the public because the wasteland had become &quot;unsafe and insalubrious&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Calais police accused of 'vicious witch-hunt' against migrants  Calais migrants return to camp just 3 months after Jungle is cleared </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the mayor's office said: &quot;There are not enough police officers to protect the area. It is a lawless and dangerous place.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's more, the site is littered with hazardous waste, including rusting metal cans, broken glass and bits of barbed wire.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notorious 'Jungle' camp - long considered a magnet for UK-bound migrants due to its close proximity to the Franco-British border - was razed to the ground in October and its more than 7,000 residents, a mixed bag of refugees and illegals, were rehoused in reception centres dotted across France.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French authorities have stopped people from entering the former refugee camp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while hundreds of immigrants are said to have fled their temporary homes in a bid to pursue their UK dream; France-bound refugees have seized this opportunity to start afresh.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamadou - a political activist who escaped poverty-stricken Equatorial Guinea in 2016 after being threatened with death and who now lives in a migrant shelter in Issoudun, a town in central France - told the daily newspaper France Bleu that he was &quot;lucky&quot; to live in France.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I spent one month sleeping rough on the streets before coming here. And I'm slowing starting to feel at home.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a Muslim, but last week I went to church with some locals. I want to be a 'regular guy'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp was popular with refugees hoping to cross into the UK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to be French. I want to find a job. I don't want to spend the rest of my life on state benefits.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mohamed Lounadi, a charity worker who works with asylum seekers at the Issoudun reception centre, says that more must be done to help migrants, and has &quot;urged&quot; locals to &quot;hang out&quot; with Mamadou and his friends in a bid to help them integrate into society.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told France Bleu: &quot;They deserve a chance to have a good life. It would be great if locals came to visit them at the centre - to have a drink and a chat - or if they offered to workout with them once or twice a week.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most refugees have fled war-ravaged countries and suffer from PTSD, and exercise really helps them forget their pain and suffering.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May's Government, which has committed itself to advancing the &quot;will of the people&quot;, is once again defying public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having failed to block its passage in Parliament, the Government is now undermining Section 67 of the 2016 Immigration Act which calls upon the UK to relocate unaccompanied refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dubs scheme, named after Lord Alf Dubs who championed the legislation, is set to be cancelled once 350 unaccompanied refugee children are admitted into the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The backstory to this relocation scheme is the Kindertransport, a series of rescue efforts where Jewish children from Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and the free city of Danzig, were brought to the UK between 1938 and 1940.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason why the Kindertransport has been invoked is because the author of the legislation, Lord Dubs, who forced the Government to back down, was himself a kindertransportee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kindertransport is now seen as a seminal event in British history - a gesture of hospitality during Europe's darkest hour. It is also one point upon which both refugee advocates and this reluctant Government agree should be celebrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, having failed to make their case on the basis of facts and evidence, loud voices in the Conservatives are further exploiting the Kindertransport in order to deny asylum seeking minors the protection they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Secretary Amber Rudd has offered two principal reasons for cancelling the Dubs scheme. First she claims it acts as a pull factor and incentivises people traffickers at the expense of child protection. Second, she claims children are better off in the region, closer to their families with who they hope to be reunited. These arguments are simplistic and without foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repeated emphasis on &quot;pull factors&quot; has been solidly trashed by refugee support organisations and academic researchers who have found that not only are journeys often unplanned but motivations tend to change en route. We heard a similar rhetoric from May as Home Secretary when she argued that the Mediterranean search and rescue operation also acted as a &quot;pull factor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, after the cancellation of Mare Nostrum - Italy's search and rescue policy - and subsequent efforts, the numbers of migrants arriving by sea increased, as did the number of deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In more than 500 interviews, scholars Heaven Crawley, Nando Sigona and Franck Duvell documented that many migrants cannot account for their eventual destination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, while refugees and migrants often pay agents, there is little evidence of trafficking at source. This was one of the conclusions of a study by Peter Hopkins and Malcolm Hill who found that while unaccompanied minors experience a range of traumatic situations before they set off, accounts of trafficking are minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, we know now that the absence of protection encourages criminality. That is why the Red Cross, Oxfam and other groups are running programmes in Greece and in Sicily to encourage asylum seekers to remain in the system in hostels and shelters, rather than take their chances on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that asylum seeking children are better off in &quot;the region&quot; defies much first-hand knowledge of the appalling conditions facing refugees across the Middle East and South-eastern Europe where they linger in sub-standard camps and where opportunities for integration are non-existent. Yet this was precisely the reason why the Government claims it is more effective and indeed necessary to relocate people directly from the region - a point made by Rudd to Parliament earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the idea that the children are passive, waiting to be reunited with their parents, and that the family system is benevolent also warrants revision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimonies from asylum seeking children present a much more complex picture. Many children actively initiate their departure as a result of intolerable conditions in their country of origin. Some young women oppressed by the family system and forced into early marriage also take flight. Many refugee children are also fleeing their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, beyond the ignorant and contradictory statements - beyond the overwhelming evidence of bad faith - what is most disturbing about the Home Secretary's position is the way in which her paternalism has been justified based on a revised history of the Kindertransport and competing claims of victimhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the Tory MP, Michael Fabricant asked the Home Secretary to condemn those who compared the situation of unaccompanied refugee children today to the 1930s. He added that it was &quot;distasteful&quot;. To strengthen his moral claims he affirmed his own Jewish ancestry which he shared with Lord Dubs. But unlike Dubs, neither he, nor his parents were refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Fabricant, in the 1930s &quot;there was no opportunity to go into Germany or the Axis countries and assist those children who faced death in concentration camps&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This last statement introduces multiple charges of revisionism - from the suggestion that the UK would assist refugee children, when in fact it was only after considerable pressure by Jewish organisations on both sides of the Channel and the heroic actions of a small number of individuals above all the likes of Nicholas Winton that ensured the Kindertransport took place at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, Winton was required to forge a substantial number of documents in order to get children into the UK. He later said: &quot;Officials at the Home Office worked very slowly with the entry visas. We went to them urgently asking for permits, only to be told languidly, 'Why rush, old boy? Nothing will happen in Europe'. This was a few months before the war broke out. So we forged the Home Office entry permits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more, in 1938, while it was clear that Jewish children were subject to persecution and were unsafe in Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, concentration camps were used for political prisoners and were largely unknown to the Jewish population until the mass deportations began in 1941. Fabricant is fabricating with his sugar coating of history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of this, Rudd chimed in with her own questionable assessment suggesting that the comparison one might make is with conditions in the camps. Bizarrely, in spite of her claim, Rudd advocates that children in excess of the 350 admitted to the UK should remain in camps in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument for receiving unaccompanied refugee children does not rest on moral or historical claims of hospitality, however interpreted. Rather the argument for receiving these children is based on an extensive body of legal, political and moral commitments that the UK has made over the past nearly 80 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main difference between the 1930s and the present day is that we have an abundance of information upon which to make informed moral and political judgments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes evidence presented by social services and policing bodies like Europol, international institutions including the UN Security Council, as well as regional organisations such as the Council of Europe, European Union, African Union and the plethora of human rights monitors and rapporteurs which feed into international treaty bodies and specialist committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also includes increasingly sophisticated mapping and forecasting tools produced by academics and NGOs, not to mention the UNHCR and International Organsation for Migration which are devoting significant resources to develop early warning systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside this, of course we have extensive reporting on refugees' conditions from trusted and robust media outlets and there is also a plethora of testimonies from refugees, many self-published and broadcast to a diverse, often global audience via social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, we now know all too well what happens to children who are separated from their families and left in transit without state protection. We know the individual and collective damage war and persecution creates. There is a massive body of literature on the harm caused by forced displacement as well important archives held by the Refugee Council, UNHCR, Red Cross in addition to a collection of award winning films on general release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than Fabricant, I too could rely on family history to make my voice heard. My stepfather, Kurt Wang, came on the Kindertransport. Leaving Vienna at 14, he arrived in Ramsgate only to be sent to Chiltern Emigrants' Training Camp, in Oxfordshire where he and other Jewish refugees worked as farm hands for eight pence a week. And like Lord Dubs, I can point to his successful integration in the UK where he was offered a new life, learned the Queen's English, changed his name to David Winsor, had a family, earned a law degree and became the second founding partner at what is now Mischon de Reya, the firm which won a landmark ruling against a Holocaust denier David Irving - and ironically also against May's refusal to consult Parliament before the Brexit vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was always grateful to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, we do not need to hark back to the Kindertransport to make the case to admit and protect asylum seeking children. We know what the moral response should be - and why the Government is wrong.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">THE CHILDREN RESCUED FROM HITLER</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kurt Wang was born in Vienna, Austria on December 7, 1924. His father died when he was four and he lived with his mother and grandparents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He left Vienna in December 1938 and arrived in Ramsgate via Harwich as part of the Kindertransport scheme. He was later moved to a collective farm, the Chiltern Emigrants' Training Camp in Oxfordshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within two years Kurt's grasp of English - learned by listening to the BBC - was fluent and within a decade he had lost his accent completely and changed his name to David Winsor. David never lived with his mother again. Though she later came to the UK as a domestic servant, she eventually moved to Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His grandparents were deported to Auschwitz where they were murdered. He married and earned a law degree from the University of London before joining Victor Mishcon in establishing Mishcon and Co Solicitors, now famous law firm Mishcon de Reya LLP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He died in 2004.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May's Government, which has committed itself to advancing the &quot;will of the people&quot;, is once again defying public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having failed to block its passage in Parliament, the Government is now undermining Section 67 of the 2016 Immigration Act which calls upon the UK to relocate unaccompanied refugee children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dubs scheme, named after Lord Alf Dubs who championed the legislation, is set to be cancelled once 350 unaccompanied refugee children are admitted into the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The backstory to this relocation scheme is the Kindertransport, a series of rescue efforts where Jewish children from Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and the free city of Danzig, were brought to the UK between 1938 and 1940.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason why the Kindertransport has been invoked is because the author of the legislation, Lord Dubs, who forced the Government to back down, was himself a kindertransportee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kindertransport is now seen as a seminal event in British history - a gesture of hospitality during Europe's darkest hour. It is also one point upon which both refugee advocates and this reluctant Government agree should be celebrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, having failed to make their case on the basis of facts and evidence, loud voices in the Conservatives are further exploiting the Kindertransport in order to deny asylum seeking minors the protection they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Secretary Amber Rudd has offered two principal reasons for cancelling the Dubs scheme. First she claims it acts as a pull factor and incentivises people traffickers at the expense of child protection. Second, she claims children are better off in the region, closer to their families with who they hope to be reunited. These arguments are simplistic and without foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repeated emphasis on &quot;pull factors&quot; has been solidly trashed by refugee support organisations and academic researchers who have found that not only are journeys often unplanned but motivations tend to change en route. We heard a similar rhetoric from May as Home Secretary when she argued that the Mediterranean search and rescue operation also acted as a &quot;pull factor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, after the cancellation of Mare Nostrum - Italy's search and rescue policy - and subsequent efforts, the numbers of migrants arriving by sea increased, as did the number of deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In more than 500 interviews, scholars Heaven Crawley, Nando Sigona and Franck Duvell documented that many migrants cannot account for their eventual destination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, while refugees and migrants often pay agents, there is little evidence of trafficking at source. This was one of the conclusions of a study by Peter Hopkins and Malcolm Hill who found that while unaccompanied minors experience a range of traumatic situations before they set off, accounts of trafficking are minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, we know now that the absence of protection encourages criminality. That is why the Red Cross, Oxfam and other groups are running programmes in Greece and in Sicily to encourage asylum seekers to remain in the system in hostels and shelters, rather than take their chances on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that asylum seeking children are better off in &quot;the region&quot; defies much first-hand knowledge of the appalling conditions facing refugees across the Middle East and South-eastern Europe where they linger in sub-standard camps and where opportunities for integration are non-existent. Yet this was precisely the reason why the Government claims it is more effective and indeed necessary to relocate people directly from the region - a point made by Rudd to Parliament earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the idea that the children are passive, waiting to be reunited with their parents, and that the family system is benevolent also warrants revision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimonies from asylum seeking children present a much more complex picture. Many children actively initiate their departure as a result of intolerable conditions in their country of origin. Some young women oppressed by the family system and forced into early marriage also take flight. Many refugee children are also fleeing their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, beyond the ignorant and contradictory statements - beyond the overwhelming evidence of bad faith - what is most disturbing about the Home Secretary's position is the way in which her paternalism has been justified based on a revised history of the Kindertransport and competing claims of victimhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the Tory MP, Michael Fabricant asked the Home Secretary to condemn those who compared the situation of unaccompanied refugee children today to the 1930s. He added that it was &quot;distasteful&quot;. To strengthen his moral claims he affirmed his own Jewish ancestry which he shared with Lord Dubs. But unlike Dubs, neither he, nor his parents were refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Fabricant, in the 1930s &quot;there was no opportunity to go into Germany or the Axis countries and assist those children who faced death in concentration camps&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This last statement introduces multiple charges of revisionism - from the suggestion that the UK would assist refugee children, when in fact it was only after considerable pressure by Jewish organisations on both sides of the Channel and the heroic actions of a small number of individuals above all the likes of Nicholas Winton that ensured the Kindertransport took place at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, Winton was required to forge a substantial number of documents in order to get children into the UK. He later said: &quot;Officials at the Home Office worked very slowly with the entry visas. We went to them urgently asking for permits, only to be told languidly, 'Why rush, old boy? Nothing will happen in Europe'. This was a few months before the war broke out. So we forged the Home Office entry permits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more, in 1938, while it was clear that Jewish children were subject to persecution and were unsafe in Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, concentration camps were used for political prisoners and were largely unknown to the Jewish population until the mass deportations began in 1941. Fabricant is fabricating with his sugar coating of history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of this, Rudd chimed in with her own questionable assessment suggesting that the comparison one might make is with conditions in the camps. Bizarrely, in spite of her claim, Rudd advocates that children in excess of the 350 admitted to the UK should remain in camps in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument for receiving unaccompanied refugee children does not rest on moral or historical claims of hospitality, however interpreted. Rather the argument for receiving these children is based on an extensive body of legal, political and moral commitments that the UK has made over the past nearly 80 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main difference between the 1930s and the present day is that we have an abundance of information upon which to make informed moral and political judgments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes evidence presented by social services and policing bodies like Europol, international institutions including the UN Security Council, as well as regional organisations such as the Council of Europe, European Union, African Union and the plethora of human rights monitors and rapporteurs which feed into international treaty bodies and specialist committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also includes increasingly sophisticated mapping and forecasting tools produced by academics and NGOs, not to mention the UNHCR and International Organsation for Migration which are devoting significant resources to develop early warning systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside this, of course we have extensive reporting on refugees' conditions from trusted and robust media outlets and there is also a plethora of testimonies from refugees, many self-published and broadcast to a diverse, often global audience via social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, we now know all too well what happens to children who are separated from their families and left in transit without state protection. We know the individual and collective damage war and persecution creates. There is a massive body of literature on the harm caused by forced displacement as well important archives held by the Refugee Council, UNHCR, Red Cross in addition to a collection of award winning films on general release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than Fabricant, I too could rely on family history to make my voice heard. My stepfather, Kurt Wang, came on the Kindertransport. Leaving Vienna at 14, he arrived in Ramsgate only to be sent to Chiltern Emigrants' Training Camp, in Oxfordshire where he and other Jewish refugees worked as farm hands for eight pence a week. And like Lord Dubs, I can point to his successful integration in the UK where he was offered a new life, learned the Queen's English, changed his name to David Winsor, had a family, earned a law degree and became the second founding partner at what is now Mischon de Reya, the firm which won a landmark ruling against a Holocaust denier David Irving - and ironically also against May's refusal to consult Parliament before the Brexit vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was always grateful to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, we do not need to hark back to the Kindertransport to make the case to admit and protect asylum seeking children. We know what the moral response should be - and why the Government is wrong.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">THE CHILDREN RESCUED FROM HITLER</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kurt Wang was born in Vienna, Austria on December 7, 1924. His father died when he was four and he lived with his mother and grandparents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He left Vienna in December 1938 and arrived in Ramsgate via Harwich as part of the Kindertransport scheme. He was later moved to a collective farm, the Chiltern Emigrants' Training Camp in Oxfordshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within two years Kurt's grasp of English - learned by listening to the BBC - was fluent and within a decade he had lost his accent completely and changed his name to David Winsor. David never lived with his mother again. Though she later came to the UK as a domestic servant, she eventually moved to Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His grandparents were deported to Auschwitz where they were murdered. He married and earned a law degree from the University of London before joining Victor Mishcon in establishing Mishcon and Co Solicitors, now famous law firm Mishcon de Reya LLP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He died in 2004.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excerpt from report by Macedonian newspaper Nova Makedonija on 3 February</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Report by Dejan Srbinovski: &quot;US Blockade of Refugees To Be Reflected on Macedonia, Too&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US ban on the entry of refugees from a number of Middle East countries engulfed by wars, which was approved by new President Donald Trump, will have a direct effect on the European countries that are currently dealing with the problem of the uncontrolled influx of refugees from these areas. [passage omitted on foreign media reports on the ban]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, part of the national experts are convinced that Macedonia, its neighbourhood, and some other European countries will be a direct victim of Washington's latest decision to ban the entry of refugees and migrants from certain Middle East countries. Political expert Ilija Dzhugumanov believes that the Macedonian security forces should now be in constant coordination with their colleagues from the neighbouring countries in terms of the possible surge of Balkans-bound migrants in the aftermath of the US decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes that all of the current indicators suggest that Trump's decision should be taken seriously, so the national authorities should consider it without reservation because it will have a major impact on the Balkans and on Macedonia, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New President Trump's decision is clear and unambiguous. He has begun enacting all the things that he openly mentioned during the election campaign, including the ban on the entry of migrants and refuges on US soil. The US Administration's ban on the entry of these person is well planned and enforced in the United States, but the rest of the word, especially Europe, as the most affected side in the migrant issue, has not given considerable thought to this mater. The EU's reactions are expected, but, unfortunately, I think that this region is not prepared well enough to respond expressly to this challenge, which may in turn result in a fresh migrant wave,&quot; our source says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dzhugumanov advises our security forces to increase alertness to the highest level, as they have done so far, because this is in our interest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As before, our country should continue monitoring carefully and with great alertness and dedication the situation on all the border crossings, especially on the southern border, particularly given the announcements of a new refugee wave following the US decision. It is of our national interest that our security forces should tighten security to the highest possible level. We have witnessed over the past two years, since the refugee crisis has shaken the whole continent, that the developments in our neighbourhood may quickly spill over in our country, too,&quot; Dzhugumanov warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to stress that our source has pointed on several occasions now that we need to pay special attention to the refugees if we wish to prevent a rerun of the ordeal that Macedonia has suffered over the past year or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why he believes that the government officials' statements that suggest that they are well informed and coordinated on this matter sound encouraging, so there is little room for unpredictable events. [passage omitted]</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by Turkish newspaper Milliyet website on 30 January</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Article by Tolga Sardan: &quot;Towards the end in granting Turkish citizenship to the Syrians&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the clashes that started in Syria in 2011 turned into a civil war, millions of Syrians were forced to abandon their homes and flee the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey was the main country that the Syrians who were fleeing either the Damascus regime or the terrorist organisations that emerged as a result of the authority vacuum created by the environment of war fled to with the aim of saving their lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The living conditions in Turkey, which the Syrians fleeing the war acknowledged as their &quot;second country,&quot; are evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to official figures, the number of Syrian refugees in Turkey has reached almost 3 million. Only 10 per cent of the approximately 3 million Syrian refugees are sheltered in 26 different camps attached to AFAD [Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency]. The remaining refugees are dispersed in 81 cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a fast breaking programme he attended in Kilis in July last year, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had announced that the Syrian refugees &quot;will be granted Turkish citizenship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following this statement, which triggered various political discussions, the Interior Ministry launched initial work with regard to granting the Syrians citizenship rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governors of 81 provinces were tasked to conduct this work, which concentrated on the database established regarding the registered Syrians living in Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Name Lists Are in Ankara</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process of the transition of the Syrians to Turkish citizenship is being conducted under the coordination of the Immigration Administration General Directorate and the Population and Citizenship Affairs General Directorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governors' Offices, taking action in the wake of the directive issued by the Interior Ministry, began assessing on a priority basis the refugees &quot;who have brought industrial plants to Turkey, or who have provided extraordinary services in the fields of science, technology, economy, society, sports, culture, and art, or who are believed to be able to provide such services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In line with the directive, the local commissions established with the participation of the relevant units within the Governors' Offices in the provinces, the MIT [National Intelligence Organization], and the police identified the persons who fulfil these criteria and &quot;who do not threaten public security,&quot; and informed Ankara accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first phase, the lists sent to Ankara contained the names of close to 700 families. These name lists were compared with the database in the Immigration Administration General Directorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to this database, close to 50,000 of the registered refugees are &quot;higher education graduates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The procedures up to this point took quite a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were interrupted by the 15 July process, and the FETO [Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organization] operations were launched in the public sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the public sector system gradually began settling down, a new phase was recently launched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently, &quot;the candidates eligible for citizenship&quot; identified following the cross-reference conducted with the Immigration Administration database were once again sent to the Governors' Offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most important criteria used in identifying these names is that the refugees whose requests for citizenship are to be examined must be university graduates or people with the potential to contribute to our country. Particular care was taken in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The units established within the Governors' Offices began local investigations with regard to the candidates earmarked for Turkish citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigations into family integrity, lineage, and paternity are continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10,000 People in the First Phase</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrians whose local investigations prove to the positive will then be subjected to a &quot;national security&quot; investigation by the MIT and the Police Intelligence Department in Ankara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of Syrians who will be granted Turkish citizenship in the first phase was planned as approximately 10,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decrees containing the files of the Syrians who have passed the national security phase and who are eligible for Turkish citizenship will be sent to the Council of Ministers, the office for the final approval, in the next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who will be approved by the Council of Ministers will have gained the right to have Turkish citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates' citizenship procedures will be conducted by the Population and Citizenship Affairs General Directorate attached to the Interior Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;exceptional citizenship&quot; status included in Article 12 of the Citizenship Law will apply in the granting of citizenship to these candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to this provision of the law, applicants who have brought industrial plants to Turkey, or who have provided extraordinary services in the fields of science, technology, economy, society, sports, culture, and art, or who are believed to be able to provide such services will be eligible for Turkish citizenship on condition that they do not pose an obstacle in terms of national security and public order. This provision obliges &quot;the relevant ministries to register their views.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to another provision in the same article of the law, the applicants will be evaluated within the framework of &quot;people whose citizenship is a necessity.&quot; In this regard, the decision will be made directly by the interior minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrians who have gained the right to acquire Turkish citizenship will receive their identity cards and become citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this process is concluded before the voter lists are prepared, the new citizens will be able to vote in the referendum in April.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 57-year-old Muslim Syrian never imagined that when he fled to neighbouring Lebanon to seek refuge from the war that he would end up converting to Christianity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Ali is not alone. Hundreds of Muslim refugees living in Lebanon have been baptised in the past year alone.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation for refugees in the country - which is hosting more than a million and a half Syrians that make up a quarter of its total population - has become so dire that some are doing whatever they can to improve their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some say they converted to benefit from the generous aid distributed by Christian charities, others to help their asylum applications to Europe, the United States, Canada and elsewhere.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian converts are more likely to be persecuted in the Middle East than those who stay Muslims, and are thus more eligible for asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Watch | Spicer: Trump's ban on Muslims is to 'protect' America                         01:16</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Converting to Christianity is virtually unheard of in Syria, where Islam is dominant and freedom of religion is limited. But Lebanon has a sizeable Christian population and a growing number of evangelical churches, which began springing up across the country in response to the crisis over the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ali fled his home in the countryside of Aleppo for Lebanon shortly after the war started in 2011. He left his wife and seven children behind in the hope of raising some money to send back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He got a job as a street cleaner and lived in basic accommodation provided by the company. He kept most of his salary with his boss - with no bank account and no home he thought it was the safest place for it.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three years he decided to leave, but his boss refused to pay him the $10,000 in wages he was owed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit:      Sam Tarling     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a refugee he had no recourse. While he had had a valid residency permit when he first arrived, Lebanon had since tightened the rules, meaning Mr Ali was now considered to be living in the country illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He could not return home as Aleppo was plagued by fighting, so he resorted to begging on the streets.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day in spring of last year he met an Iraqi Christian in a cafe in the poor Beirut suburb of Bourj Hammoud. He told Mr Ali that the church nextdoor was handing out food packages to refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went the next day to the Anglican Church of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They offered him a bed, two hot meals a day and a small monthly stipend, on the condition he agreed to attend their weekly Bible study sessions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Almost everyone attending the classes was Muslim. Mostly Syrian &nbsp;and Iraqi refugees. I'd never seen anything like it - Muslims singing about Jesus,&quot; he laughed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was asked if he wanted to convert and - along with a dozen or so other members of the group - was baptised last April. He was given a new Christian name - Abed al-Massih, meaning Slave of Christ in Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Changing religion in the Middle East is a very big thing,&quot; said Mr Ali. &quot;In Syria you very occasionally hear of Christians converting to Islam but never the other way round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are doing it to get to Europe, the US and Canada. While I plan to stay in Lebanon, I know hundreds of other Syrians have been baptised just to help their applications. They would do anything to have security for their family.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit:      AP     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alia al-Haji is one of them. The 29-year-old, her husband and three young children, attend a church in the nearby Christian neighbourhood of Achrafiyeh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) tells us it doesn't help your application to be Christian, but that's not our experience,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Lebanese hate the refugees, so they make life as hard for us as possible. My son is sick and we can't afford medicine. My husband is not allowed to work - I feel we will die here if we stay,&quot; said Mrs Haji, who uses a pseudonym as her family in Syria do not know of her plans to convert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hajis live in a one-bedroom apartment with two other families, none of whom have work permits.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Haji is considered one of the lucky ones. Most Syrian refugees spend years in camps, dependent on handouts.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michel Aoun, Lebanon's new president, last week warned that the country could no longer support the burgeoning number of refugees and that the government would begin sending them back to &quot;safe zones&quot; in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Said Deeb at the Church of God, where Mr Ali was baptised, said scores of refugees come to him every week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have people begging me to help them become Christian,&quot; he told the Telegraph from his office above the church in Bourj Hammoud. &quot;They think it will help them claim asylum abroad. They say 'just baptise me, I will believe in whoever just to leave here'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some charities accuse the evangelical churches of exploiting the refugees' situation by pressuring them to convert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to claims of encouraging &quot;rice Christians&quot; - a pejorative term used to describe someone who has formally declared themselves a Christian for material benefits rather than for religious reasons - Pastor Deeb said that he expected people to first come to Christian agencies for practical help.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But even if they come for the food and clothing, we see that God changes their hearts,&quot; he said. &quot;We never force anyone into the religion, it must be their choice, they must accept Jesus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversions in the Middle East are fraught with difficulties and dangers. People that decide to change their religion often face being cast out by their communities.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Deeb said he has received dozens of calls and messages from the friends and relatives of those he has baptised, threatening to kill him for encouraging &quot;apostasy&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr Ali's family, who come from a small, conservative village outside Aleppo, found out what he had done they refused to accept it.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They told me I was dead to them, that I was to never come back to Syria as I had bought shame on them. They even held a funeral for me&nbsp;and told everyone I had died.&nbsp;They'd rather that then tell them I had left Islam.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE have become used to seeing harrowing images of the war in Syria and the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of us do little more than spare a thought for the people whose lives have been ripped apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of us may make a donation to a charity if we are feeling particularly generous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 49-year-old Paul Hutchings is different.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former marketing consultant from Brighton was so moved by what he had seen on the news that he gave up his job to launch his own charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His heroics have appeared in this paper before. But today he speaks candidly about the sacrifices he has made, the stress on his family and the difficulties he has faced dealing with the greatest humanitarian crisis of our generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hutchings, who has two daughters, 13 and 10, and two stepsons, 19 and 16, said: &quot;I was watching the news 18 months ago and I was getting really frustrated because not enough was being done to help the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In September 2015 I saw an opportunity to go to Calais, so I hired a van for a long weekend and I ended up coming and going between Calais and Brighton for about six months, I got involved in an organisation there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then in April 2016 someone who I was working with in Calais was really keen to do something in Greece, and I was keen to do something there as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hutchings, who lives in Hollingbury Park Avenue, teamed up with John Sloan, a retired man from Birmingham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together they set up Refugee Support with the aim to help refugees in camps in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially run by the Greek army, the camps were notorious for poor quality food and consistent levels of individual support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They reasoned that even a small organisation such as Refugee Support could get things done - and quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently the Refugee Support organisation is running two main projects in Greece: one in Alexandreia and one in Philippiada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hutchings said that working in the camp can be extremely difficult, especially given the bureaucratic of the Greek Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the charity has in a few months managed to achieve some important goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the project he is most proud of is a point-system shop the charity introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each family has points to spend. These are allocated in accordance with how many people are in each family with different items having different point values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This simple mechanism means that families can choose what they need rather than receive a standard pre-packed box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind this small but fast-growing organisation there are people with immense courage and strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not just volunteers, but also the founders and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hutchings said: &quot;I was a market researcher, so basically a lot of what I did was running a business, making sure that money was coming in, making plans and putting resources in the right place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to live my life in my comfort zone. I never raised funds before, I never had a group of 10 to 15 volunteers, I never found myself in emergency situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Often I have difficult conversations with volunteers, with people who are giving us money, difficult conversations with refugees who have huge problems, difficult conversations with other associations we work with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never felt in fear for my safety, but I definitely felt in fear for things not to succeed. That fear is always there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul's wife lawyer Sarah Thorne said the change was at first difficult to handle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 44-year-old said: &quot;It was quite worrying. Obviously, I was concerned about how we were going to pay for the house, for the children and everything. Moreover, I thought that it could be dangerous, especially when he was going to Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are times when I think this is too much. But I recognise that it's something that Paul needs to do, and that everything Paul, John and all volunteers are doing is brilliant. I have seen myself the difference that they have made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Italian volunteer currently involved in the Refugee Support activities, Bruno Sclavo, 36 from Rome, spent last November in Greece. He has returned to Italy but is already planning to return to Greece early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Paul and John's determination prevailed over difficulties, and within a few months they built a mini market, a small boutique, a toy store, a community kitchen, a cinema for children and a storehouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Deciding to come here was the best choice. I always experienced wars and natural disasters with a sense of helplessness, but not now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul and Sarah's children are young but old enough to be proud of their dad's work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They miss their father but at the same time are developing awareness about the issues involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He event visited their school, Downs Junior School, Brighton, to talk about his work as part of the Refugee Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The thing I hope is that they can see that if there is a problem, everyone can do something, everyone can make a difference. That if you are determined, you should follow that instinct, and do the right thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crew of the Save the Children rescue ship Vos Hestia cannot forget the tragedy of pulling<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN> 20 dead refugees from the<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN> Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scots crew member Gillian Moyes remembers the children among them, their lives stolen by utter desperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;That day, we all felt the full horror of the refugee crisis. They were just young people fleeing poverty,<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN> persecution and war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were people with hopes and dreams like us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity launched their own rescue boat last September and in three months, it saved 2700 people, including 400 children under 18 - 90 per cent of them unaccompanied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year was the deadliest for<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN> refugees crossing to Europe via the Mediterranean, with more than 5000 deaths.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of children crossing the central Mediterranean in 2016 increased by 76 per cent compared with 2015, while the number of children travelling alone more than doubled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity felt compelled to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillian, from Perth, has just begun<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>her second three-month stint on the Vos Hestia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Often, we are humanitarian workers at a distance, supporting from our laptops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the ship, it is different - we are rescuers, paramedics, social workers, tea-makers and general labourers and everyone has to muck in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see and hear refugees' and migrants' stories up close, giving us a unique insight into the varied drivers behind the current 'migration crisis'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vos Hestia carries out rescues on a stretch of sea three times the size of the UK and a refugee can be saved from the water for the cost of an iPhone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees offer to give back to community by serving food at International Women's Day celebrations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crew include Gillian, a doctor, two nurses, two child protection officers and two logisticians. There are also three cultural mediators who speak a number of languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are often the first point of contact for refugee boats when there is a risk of panic causing a capsize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save the Children's senior<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN> humanitarian adviser Rob MacGillivray pulled together the service and has been with the organisation since 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob, also a Scot, has been deployed around the globe in response to crises, including the aftermath of the Iraq War and the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The Mediterranean is one of the largest unmarked graves of recent times. We don't know the exact numbers that have died and more will follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are faced with a situation where you can save lives, you do it. That defines us as who we are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Were we to turn our back, we would become lesser people as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of refugees killed in car bomb attack during bid to flee war-torn Syrian city</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the same way as when there is an earthquake or a flood, not everyone in the developing world has enough resources or capacity to be able<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>to get life-saving services and it falls to the charities like Save the Children to be able to provide that when few else will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob disputes the claim that<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>rescue ships are a pull factor for<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>the desperate fleeing violence,<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>deprivation and torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Europe is seen as a safe haven for people who have gone through the most heinous forms of treatment, including rape, torture and political persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are forced to take the drastic step of taking a stricken boat to Europe and people-smugglers don't care whether these people die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are a mother, only<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>desperation will lead you to put your child on a boat and leave them. We can't just let them drown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ship patrols the south central Mediterranean, up to 20 nautical miles from the Libyan coastline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crew work closely with the Italian coastguard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save the Children have been working in the ports of southern Italy since 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vos Hestia is a rescue ship that might typically be used in the North Sea to evacuated an oil rig and it has a large deck space, with a capacity for more than 350 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, it carried 551 people from a rescue in the southern Mediterranean just outside of Libyan territorial waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shipping container on board has been adapted to house a health clinic, there is a separate space for children, storage areas for foods and blankets and a mortuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the ship, the team attend to the refugees' medical needs, which can be serious as often people haven't seen a doctor for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emergency cases are transferred to hospital by a helicopter service provided by Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, when people get on board the ship, they collapse. They're so weak and when they finally know they are safe, their bodies just give up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often people are malnourished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been a number of medical evacuations, including for five-year-old Syrian girl Amena who had chronic asthma and needed an oxygen mask to breathe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her father felt compelled to take Amena and her little brother on the perilous journey after the war in Syria placed his family in greater danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;It was a very difficult<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>decision. My daughter had asthma and I thought if something happened at sea, would God forgive me? Would the children forgive me?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time the boat hit the waves, I thought that was it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His children begged him to take them back but there was no choice but to go on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I saw the Save the<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>Children ship and I hugged my<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>children. I thanked God that we had made it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another rescue, a Somalian girl with suspected TB and malnutrition was so desperately sick that she had to be taken ashore by the coastguard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there was the time a heavily pregnant woman who was travelling alone developed life-threatening<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>pre-eclampsia and needed to be transferred to hospital immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was taken to hospital in Malta and gave birth to a boy that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the ship reaches shore, rescued people are registered by the Italian authorities and the Red Cross, and taken to reception centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Onshore teams work to ensure<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>children get the support and advice they need and risks such as trafficking are addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help the ship continue its<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>life-saving work, donate via<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>savethechildren.org.uk/scotland</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain will go to the polls on 8 June with aid and development spending under unprecedented scrutiny. Two years after the UK became the first major economy to meet the UN target of devoting 0.7% of gross national income to aid, the Whitehall vultures are circling. Government departments including the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office are casting covetous glances at the &pound;12bn aid budget, while allegations of wasteful spending on contractors and ill-conceived projects have fuelled wider criticism. How are the main parties planning to negotiate this political minefield? Outlined below are the key commitments on aid and development contained in the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos. The Scottish National Party's manifesto will be launched on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 40 Somali refugees have been killed in an attack on a boat off the coast of Yemen while attempting to flee the country's brutal civil war. Coastguard authorities in the Houthi rebel stronghold of Hodeida said a helicopter gunship attacked the vessel they were travelling on in the Red Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Yemeni people smuggler who survived the attack said the boat had set sail overnight, aiming to cross to Sudan. Al-Hassan Ghaleb Mohammed said women and children were among his passengers from the port of Ras Arra, along the southern coastline in Yemen's Hodeida province. He told the Associated Press that their boat had reached around 30 miles from shore when the helicopter gunship approached and opened fire, sparking panic on board. Migrants finally managed to hold up torches to show they were civilians, when he said the helicopter stopped firing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos that were too graphic to publish showed the bodies of women and men in civilian clothes lying on top of one another in the partially destroyed boat, their belongings splattered with blood. Children were believed to be among the dead. Mohamed al-Alay, a coastguard official, told Reuters the refugees, carrying official UN documents, were attacked by an Apache helicopter near the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. Houthi rebels accused the Saudi-led air coalition of carrying out the attack, following heavy bombardment in the area, where it accuses Shia fighters of smuggling weapons into Hodeida in small boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Organisation for Migration said at least 42 people had been killed and dozens injured on the boat, which had about 140 people on board. The survivors - 75 men and 15 women - were taken to detention centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said it was &quot;deeply distressed&quot; by the casualties and called for all parties in the Yemeni civil war to protect civilians in accordance with international law. &quot;UNHCR is appalled by this tragic incident, the latest in which civilians continue to disproportionately bear the brunt of conflict in Yemen,&quot; spokesperson William Spindler said. &quot;UNHCR has been following up to provide urgent assistance and support to the survivors and to the families of those deceased.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency warned that conditions in Yemen were continuing to deteriorate, forcing asylum seekers to leave the country either northwards or across the Red Sea, including some with the intention of reaching Europe. &quot;This tragic incident is the latest in which innocent civilians, including Yemenis, refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, continue to suffer and disproportionately bear the brunt of the conflict in Yemen,&quot; Mr Spindler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack, although Saudi-led forces including the United Arab Emirates are known to deploy Apache helicopters as part of their air campaign in support of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. The coastal province of Hodeida has come under heavy bombardment in recent years as a stronghold of Houthi rebels, who are fighting the internationally-recognised government alongside forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yemen's civil war, which is about to enter its third year of bloodshed, has allowed terrorist groups including Isis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to seize territory and carry out attacks. Despite violence that has left more than 10,000 people dead and 17 million facing starvation, African migrants seeking work in Saudi Arabia have continued using Yemen as a transit point. Yemen is hosting over 255,000 Somali refugees, with more than 117,000 new asylum seekers arriving in the country last year as the UNHCR ran a campaign warning of the dangers of crossing the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea, as well as inside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam warned that with the conflict worsening, Somalis are being displaced for a second time, joining thousands of people attempting to flee on boats to the Horn of Africa. Almost 1 million Somalis are displaced in surrounding countries and 1.1 million inside the country itself according to the UN, which said the three-decade-long refugee crisis is &quot;among the most protracted in the world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Salisbury, a senior research fellow in the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Chatham House, said it was the first military attack on a refugee boat he was aware of. Describing the conflict as a &quot;forgotten war&quot;, he said many migrants had been unable to leave the Yemen. &quot;Although it has displaced hundreds of thousands of people they haven't been able to flee or get further than neighbouring countries,&quot; he told The Independent. &quot;We haven't seen the flow of refugees into Europe, which makes a huge difference in public understanding and the western approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somali refugees were previously killed in Yemen during a brief conflict between northern and southern forces in 1994, when hundreds died after their camp was caught in the crossfire.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     German states spent more than (EURO)20bn (&pound;17.5bn) on refugees in 2016, government figures have indicated as Angela Merkel continues to come under pressure for her policy on migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics seen by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Independent</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the states of Bavaria, Schleswig-Holstein, Hesse and Berlin show that the cost of housing and integrating asylum seekers has far outstripped official predictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bundestag's statistics service has listed a total spend of over (EURO)7bn (&pound;6bn) for those four states alone in 2016, meaning the nationwide figure is likely to be far higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany approves new integration law for refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannes Singhammer, Vice President of the German parliament, told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Die Welt                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;[The figures] show that if the costs are added up for all federal states, around (EURO)23bn (&pound;20bn) has probably been spent on migrants and refugees in 2016.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four states recorded have taken around a third of asylum seekers currently living in Germany, where more than a million have arrived since the start of the refugee crisis in 2015.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 10 attacks on refugees a day in Germany in 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berlin set aside (EURO)685m (&pound;600m) for accommodation, unaccompanied minors, integration programmes, healthcare, language lessons and other projects but spent around (EURO)1.3bn (&pound;1.1bn) in total - almost double the budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of Bavaria spent (EURO)3.3bn (&pound;2.9bn), Hesse (EURO)1.6bn (&pound;1.4bn) and Schleswig-Holstein (EURO)783.7m (&pound;685.9m).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the Bundestag's statistics authority said a complete report would be made public when other states had calculated their spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official survey conducted in December 2015 predicted that federal states would spend (EURO)17bn (&pound;15bn) on dealing with the refugee crisis in the following year but with a huge backlog of asylum claims and difficulties with deportation, costs have spiralled beyond expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's government has drawn up a new package of refugee funding for state authorities, as well as plunging money into new housing construction to prevent migrants sleeping in emergency accommodation like school gymnasiums and military barracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the huge financial cost of the ongoing crisis, Germany's federal government announced a budget surplus of (EURO)6.2bn (&pound;5.4bn) last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unprecedented number of refugees arriving in 2015 generated a huge backlog of claims that civil servants are still working to clear, with more than 430,000 cases outstanding at the start of 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas de Maizi&egrave;re, the German interior minister, said about 55,000 migrants returned home voluntarily, compared with 35,000 in 2015, while another 25,000 were forcibly deported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the government announced a scheme to offer migrants financial incentives of up to (EURO)1,200 (&pound;1,000) each to leave Germany and withdraw their application for protection, with a lower amount of (EURO)800 (&pound;700) if they choose to depart after being refused asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr de Maizi&egrave;re said StarthilfePlus was intended for those with &quot;very poor chances of success&quot; under the country's asylum laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I appeal to understanding and reason: For all those who have no prospect of staying in Germany, voluntarily departure represents a better way than deportation,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flow of asylum seekers into the country has fallen dramatically since the implementation of the controversial EU-Turkey deal last March, which aimed to slow boat crossings to Greece by seeing anyone arriving detained under threat of deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of new applications plummeted by more than 600,000 last year, standing at less than a third of those at the height of the crisis, when Ms Merkel opened Germany's borders to Syrian refugees amid a series of boat disasters in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children play in a building converted into refugee accommodation in Frankfurt (EPA)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her policy sparked the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers in Germany, many of whom are still housed in temporary accommodation while awaiting a government decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-immigration and far-right groups have criticised the decision, blaming the Chancellor for a series of Isis-inspired terror attacks carried out by migrants in Germany last year, including the Berlin Christmas market massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The atrocities and increasing concern over migration have driven surging support for the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is expected to enter the national parliament (Bundestag) for the first time as Ms Merkel battles for a fourth term in September's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was fresh scrutiny this week after Germany's federal prosecutor charged three suspected Isis members with planning a terror attack in D&uuml;sseldorf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said the two of the Syrian men, aged between 25 and 27,investigated smuggling routes to Europe for jihadis in 2014, sending several refugees as tests before journeying along the migrant route themselves in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They allegedly drew the third suspect into the plot and worked with an Isis bomb maker already deployed to Germany by commanders, planning to detonate two suicide bombs in D&uuml;sseldorf's popular Old Town before other militants massacred as many passers-by with guns as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan was thwarted after one of the conspirators turned himself into French authorities in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man injured seven people with an axe in a rampage at D&uuml;sseldorf's main railway station on Thursday but police said there was no indication of a link to terrorism and described the 36-year-old suspect as mentally ill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. President Donald Trump says he loves Australia and will 'respect' the asylum-seeker deal for refugees held on Manus Island and Nauru after a diplomatic crisis erupted when details of his phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull  were revealed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Trump, before a meeting with US steelworkers at the White House on Thursday, blasted the deal negotiated by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last year with former U.S. president Barack Obama.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have a lot of respect for Australia,' Mr Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I love Australia as a country but I have a problem where for whatever reason President Obama said they were going to take probably well over 1000 illegal immigrants who were in prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'1250, could be 2000, could be more than that and I said 'Why? Why are we doing this?'.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Sean Spicer said refugees will only be allowed in the U.S. if they pass extreme vetting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press briefing following Mr Trump's and Mr Turnbull's heated exchange, the Press Secretary&nbsp;appeared to refer to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull as 'Trumble'&nbsp;a number of times.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The President had a very cordial conversation with Prime Minister Trumble,' Mr Spicer seems to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He [Mr Trump] has respect for the Australian people and respect for Prime Minister Trumble.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Mr Trump continued his public stoush with Mr Turnbull by declaring he needs to make 'tough phone calls' because nations are taking advantage of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diplomatic crisis erupted after the contents of the first telephone call between Donald&nbsp; Trump  and&nbsp; Malcolm Turnbull  over a deal signed off by Barack Obama to take 1,250 asylum seekers from Manus and Nauru were revealed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump accused Malcolm Turnbull of trying to send the 'next Boston bombers' to the United States during their first official telephone conversation.&nbsp;Senior US officials told the Washington Post &nbsp;that Donald Trump abruptly ended the conversation with Mr Turnbull after just 25 minutes - when the pair were meant to speak for an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then on Thursday, the President took to&nbsp;Twitter to slam the Obama administration for agreeing to take on the refugees in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!,' he wrote.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a morning speech in Washington DC, Mr Trump said the world was in trouble but he was 'going to straighten it out'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it,' Mr Trump told the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Just don't worry about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They're tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have to be tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's time we have to be a little tough folks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's not going to happen anymore.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post revealed on Wednesday a weekend call between Mr Trump and Mr Turnbull had ended abruptly.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr Turnbull has denied Mr Trump hung up on him, telling 2GB's Ben Fordham: 'As far as the call is concerned, I'm very disappointed, the report the president hung up is not correct, the call ended courteously.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         US SENATOR WANTS TRUMP TO SLEEP MORE AND TWEET LESS &nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior Republican figures have gone into damage control mode following a fiery conversation U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull&nbsp;and the&nbsp;asylum-seeker deal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Australia is a very central ally,' Speaker of the US House of Representatives Paul Ryan said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They are and will continue to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think it is important presidents, prime ministers and heads of state are able to have candid and private conversations with each other.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Lindsey Graham took aim at Mr Trump's use of Twitter, including a tweet on Wednesday describing the asylum-seeker deal between Australia and the US as 'dumb'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I wish he would sleep more and tweet less, but that's up to him,' Senator Graham told CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Graham, who worked alongside the Australian military in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the alliance would survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also showed support for the asylum-seeker deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The relationship is strong and can withstand a phone call,' Senator Graham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We'll be fine with Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The 1250 refugees we are talking about, if they are well vetted, we can absorb them.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Malcolm Turnbull's colleagues are praising the prime minister for putting Australia first and pushing for the US refugee deal during his hostile call with Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabinet minister Christopher Pyne is insistent the arrangement struck with the Obama administration to take asylum seekers from Nauru and Manus Island still stands, despite Mr Trump labelling it the worst deal ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Malcolm Turnbull stood up to it and the reality is Australia's interests are being put first,' he said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the details of the telephone call, a fuming President Trump told Mr Turnbull that the conversation was 'the worst call by far' he had taken that day, after 'boasting' about pleasant exchanges with Russian President Vladimir Putin and three other world leaders.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump ranted about the deal the Obama administration's deal to take 1250 genuine refugees from Nauru and Manus Island, telling Mr Turnbull: 'I don't want these people'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the 'worst deal ever', he told the prime minister, complaining he was 'going to get killed' politically for following through on the resettlement agreement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News sources claim President Trump was 'yelling' at Mr Turnbull at points during the heated conversation, which took place on Saturday afternoon Washington time, Sunday morning Australian time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump indicated he was sceptical about what America got out of honouring the deal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT IS THE AUSTRALIA-US REFUGEE DEAL?                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration and Turnbull government struck a deal to resettle some of the refugees being held offshore in Nauru and Manus Island in November last year&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has a 'zero tolerance' policy towards illegal boat arrivals and only genuine refugees are sent to Nauru and Manus Island&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are approximately 1,250 refugees being held in the Australian-funded offshore detention centres</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large majority of those refugees come from Iran, Iraq and Somalia - all countries on US President Donald Trump's travel-ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump reportedly agreed to honour the deal, on the condition the refugees would undergo 'extreme vetting'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US President reportedly described it as the 'worst deal ever' in a heated conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr Turnbull apparently suggested they move on and talk about foreign affairs, including the conflict in Syria, President Trump ended the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'During call with Australian PM on refugees, Trump pulled phone away from ear and says he wants off call, which ends abruptly per source,' CNN reporter Jim Acosta tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement reached with the Obama administration, Australian would take a number of South American refugees, currently in a processing center in Costa Rica, in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These refugees are predominantly Christian, according to reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to revelations of the hostile phone conversation, Mr Turnbull remained tight-lipped on Thursday and said that he wasn't going to comment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's better that these things - these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News reporter Laura Jayes said Australian government sources who took part in discussions after the call said Mr Turnbull viewed the president as a 'bully'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What I derived from that was Malcolm Turnbull used this phone call to push back,' Ms Jayes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He wasn't just sitting there being berated by Donald Trump, he talked about how important it was for (Trump) to honour the deal.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosive report is a huge embarrassment for Mr Turnbull, who has insisted in recent days the asylum seeker deal is solid and relations with Washington are fine.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and Australia have been close military and economic allies for generations, with Australian troops fighting alongside Americans in every military conflict Washington has been involved in since World War II.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is one of just four other countries the US shares security intelligence with under the Five Eyes alliance. The two countries have also shared a free trade agreement since 2005.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official statement about the phone call released by the White House told a different story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Both leaders emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally,' it said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull on Monday described the call as constructive, saying the pair acknowledged the already strong and deep relationship between the US and Australia and committed to making it stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That's my job. My job is to defend the national interest of Australia and defend the interests of Australians,' he told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You may wish to speculate about policies and politics in Washington, that's not my role. My job is today and everyday to stand up for Australia and that's what I do.&nbsp;'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also thanked the president for 'committing' to honour the refugee agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1.30pm (AEDT) on Thursday the US Embassy in Australia released a statement that the deal would go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'President Trump's decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed and Spokesman Spicer's comments stand,' a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this Embassy at 13:15 Canberra time.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it came after a morning of mixed messages from various official sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday it was reported that the White House had backtracked on the asylum seeker deal, saying that President Trump was still considering it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said the deal had not been confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if it were to go ahead, it would only be because of the United States' 'longstanding relationship with Australia,'&nbsp; The ABC  reported.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         'CRUEL, INHUMAN AND DEGRADING': UN HITS OUT OVER 'OPEN-AIR PRISON'                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has been heavily criticized by the UN for its policy of sending migrants to offshore detention centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November UN investigator Francois Crepeau visited the island of Nauru, where asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent, and described conditions as 'cruel, inhuman and degrading'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Crepeau said Australia's policies 'have increasingly eroded the human rights of migrants in contravention of its international human rights and humanitarian obligations'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he continued: 'Australia would vehemently protest if its citizens were treated like this by other counties and especially if Australian children were treated like this.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International said in October that the immigration center was an 'open-air prison'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes just one day after Mr Spicer told reporters Mr Trump would honour the 'one-off' deal with former President Barack Obama in November to resettle refugees detained on Manus and Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Part of the deal is they have to be vetted in the same manner that we are doing now.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Mr Trump placed a temporary ban on refugees being admitted to the US and other strict border measures targeting seven countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr Trump confirmed his administration would continue to honour the 2016 refugee resettlement arrangement while acknowledging a common interest in preventing irregular and illegal migration.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The president, in accordance with that deal to honour what had been agreed upon by the US government, and ensuring that vetting will take place in the same manner that we are doing it now, it will go forward,' Mr Spicer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are being held on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and Nauru.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters at the G'day USA gala in Hollywood, Ms Bishop said Mr Turnbull would travel to the US for a yet to be scheduled meeting with the president.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     TOUGH IMMIGRATION LAWS WHICH SEE 'BOAT PEOPLE' SENT TO OFFSHORE CAMPS                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offshore detention in Australia has been in place since 2001, and in 2013 Australia's mainland was excluded from its migration zone for people who arrive by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now migrants who arrive on Australian shores by sea are immediately sent to the island of Nauru or Papau New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stay in detention facilities while their applications to be accepted into Australia are processed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although 90 per cent are ruled to have valid claims, they are not allowed to settle in the Australian mainland, instead being allowed to stay in Nauru or Papau New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy has come under heavy fire, with conditions in the camp branded 'inhuman' by a UN inspector in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters claim it deters migrants from arriving in dangerous vessels, and ensures refugees enter the country through proper channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015 Australia agreed to accept 12,000 refugees from Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous year violence had erupted at a protest at the detention center on Manus Island, and a 23-year-old Iranian man was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull has previously stated that Australians cannot be 'misty-eyed' about immigration, saying: 'We must have secure borders and we do and we will, and they will remain so, as long as I am the prime minister of this country.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

For all of their moaning in the pub and political rants online, my white friends have been slow to click 'attending'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just over 30 years ago my family and I arrived in England as refugees. We fled war torn Cambodia, trekking through the jungle with my elderly grandmother who had to be carried, dodging bullets as we reached the border to live in a refugee camp in Thailand. We were there for almost three years before finally being able to come to England. If we had stayed where we were, there's no doubt we would have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the situation Syrian refugees find themselves in as they try to escape their war ravaged country as US President Donald Trump has placed an indefinite 'travel ban' on their entry to the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees from other nations are not permitted to enter the US for the next 120 days. After this date, they can only enter the country if they are on the list of counties the US has okayed. All other immigrants or visa holders from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen are unable to enter the US for the next 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vocal protests at US airports attack Donald Trump's executive action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only exception to this rule is if a refugee isa &quot;religious minority&quot; who is being persecuted in their homeland. Essentially, Christian refugees are ok, but Muslims can think again about trying to enter the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trump administration is framing the executive order as a security measure, titled &quot;Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals&quot;, but it is worth bearing in mind that no one from the seven countries on the banned list has been responsible for a terror attack on American soil. This ban is not rational, it is racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night an invite began to circulate on my Facebook feed for an Emergency Demo against Trump's #MuslimBan and UK complicity. Marches are scheduled to take place in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Manchester. Someof my white friends have clicked interested, but few have confirmed that they will join me on the march. For all of their moaning in the pub and political rants online, they are slow to actually stand up against Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response from our own government has been equally as reticent. Prime Minister Theresa May failed to condemn the policy, while other world leaders were quick to censure. Her reserve a clear message that the UK is willing to forgo any moral purpose for the sake of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Later a spokesperson confirmed that Downing Street does, &quot;not agree with this kind of approach&quot;. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said that it was, &quot;divisive and wrong to stigmatise because of the nationality&quot;. Still, Trump is due to visit the UK, despite a petition to stop his state visit reaching 1m signatures. So why are my friends not willing to stand up and show that they stand on the right side of history unlike our government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evil happens when good people to do nothing. Don't be a good person that does nothing. White friends, lending your voice to this is one of the most important things you can do. Just because it doesn't directly affect you doesn't make it OK. Refugees are your doctors, taxi drivers, colleagues and friends and you have to stick up for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not enough just to &quot;not be racist&quot; anymore, because the racists are winning. They are in power and they are emboldened. Protesting Trump's polices in the UK might not make him reverse his executive order overnight, but it will make our elected representatives see that we won't stand for it. Sign the petitions, go to the marches, write to your MP, donate to charities that provide support to refugees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Donald Trump has signed a new executive order reinstating a ban on immigration from six Muslim-majority countries and halting the entry of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revised travel ban blocks entry to the US for people from six of the seven countries named in the president's original order, who are seeking new visas and also suspends the country's refugee programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House has dropped Iraq from the list of banned countries, which includes Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes six weeks after Mr Trump's original executive order was rolled out and caused chaos and confusion at airports nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump had held a 'signing ceremony' for the original order(Getty Images)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump's directive aims to address legal issues with the original order, which sparked protests around the country and was ultimately blocked by federal courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revised order is narrower and specifies that a 90-day ban on people from the six countries does not apply to those who already have valid visas who can travel freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraq was dropped from the order following pressure from the Pentagon and state department, which had urged the White House to reconsider given Iraq's role in fighting Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iraqi spokesman said the change marks a &quot;positive step&quot; and shows Washington and Baghdad have a &quot;real partnership&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mere existence of the fact sheet signalled that the White House was taking steps to improve the rollout of the reworked directive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial measure was hastily signed at the end of Mr Trump's first week in office, and the White House was roundly criticised for not providing Cabinet officials and others with information ahead of the signing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original travel order led to protests around the world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably, Mr Trump was not holding a public signing ceremony for the new measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Michael Short said the signing was done privately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, several Cabinet secretaries - homeland security secretary John Kelly, secretary of state Rex Tillerson and attorney general Jeff Sessions - planned to discuss the order at an event late on Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House press secretary Sean Spicer was not scheduled to hold an on-camera briefing on Monday either, leading to the appearance that the president was distancing himself from the order, which was a signature issue during his campaign and the first days of his presidency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also risks being overshadowed by unsubstantiated accusations the president made over the weekend that former president Barack Obama had ordered the tapping of his phone during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump administration officials said that even with the changes, the goal of the new order is the same as the first: keeping would-be terrorists out of the United States while the government reviews the vetting system for refugees and visa applicants from certain parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the fact sheet, the Department of Homeland Security will conduct a country-by-country review of the information the six targeted nations provides to the US for visa and immigration decisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those countries will then have 50 days to comply with US government requests to update or improve that information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, Trump's order suspends the entire US refugee programme for 120 days, though refugees already formally scheduled for travel by the State Department will be allowed entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the suspension is lifted, the number of refugees allowed into the US will be capped at 50,000 for fiscal year 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islam to become world's largest religion as it outpaces global population growth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other changes are also expected, including no longer singling out Syrian refugees for an indefinite ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian refugees will now be treated like other refugees and be subjected to the 120-day suspension of the refugee programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new version is also expected to remove language that would give priority to religious minorities. Critics had accused the administration of adding such language to help Christians get into the United States while excluding Muslims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CELEBRITIES and campaigners are calling on the Prime Minister not to end the Dubs scheme for vulnerable and lone child refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juliet Stevenson said that people would vote to keep the lone child scheme in place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme, named after its architect, Labour peer Lord Dubs, will be capped once another 150 unaccompanied children are brought to Britain, on top of the 200 already in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branding the decision &quot;truly shameful&quot;, more than 200 figures including Carey Mulligan, Gary Lineker, Keira Knightley, Benedict Cumberbatch and Ralph Fiennes have signed an open letter to Theresa May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juliet Stevenson said that if Theresa May put the decision to end the lone child refugee scheme to a referendum, people would vote to keep it in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been chasing people to see if they are interested in putting their name to it, and there is not a single person who has refused,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Urgent action on Syria needed, says drowned refugee boy's aunt  Juliet Stevenson in last plea for Britain to take Jungle children </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who don't normally stand up, people who don't normally put their head above the parapet, who don't normally get politically involved - all sorts of people who just want now to stand up and say okay, enough is enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter, backed by Help Refugees and Citizen UK's Safe Passage programme, says it is &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; to &quot;slam the door shut after just 350 children have reached safety&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lord Dubs was himself a child saved by Sir Nicholas Winton who rescued 669 children virtually single-handed,&quot; it reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is embarrassing that the Prime Minister's entire Government will not even manage to match the example set by her former constituent all those years ago, let alone the efforts of the Kindertransport movement of which he was a part which saved 10,000 children from the Nazis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevenson has been chasing people to see if they are interested</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been strong criticism of the Government since it announced earlier this month that it will scrap the programme for resettling lone youngsters from mainland Europe to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Government had not committed to any specific number, campaigners and opposition figures have previously called for 3,000 children to be given sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter comes days after the Home Office said that due to a lack of places for vulnerable child refugees identified by local authorities, the scheme would finish at the end of the financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those to sign the letter are Coldplay, Juliet Stevenson, Gok Wan, Caroline Flack, Jude Law, Michael Morpurgo, Douglas Booth, Joely Richardson, Lily Allen, Sir Mark Rylance and Ruby Wax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caroline Flack, among others, signed the letter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rabbi Janet Darley, of Citizen UK's Safe Passage programme, also welcomed the &quot;intervention by this broad range of public figures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shutting the door on refugee children leaves them with a terrible choice of train tracks on the one hand and people traffickers on the other,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, flanked by a group of children, local politicians and faith leaders, Lord Dubs delivered a 50,000-signature petition to 10 Downing Street, accusing the Government of a &quot;very shabby cop-out&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesman said: &quot;We are not giving up on vulnerable children who are fleeing conflict and danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jude Law also signed the letter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality is that just in the last two weeks more than 300 refugees have arrived in the UK and around half of these were children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's also a fact that more than 8,000 children found shelter, security and safety in the UK in the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's a further fact that this Government is committed to resettling up to 3,000 vulnerable children and their families from the Mena region and 20,000 Syrian refugees by the end of this parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are the actions of a Government determined to help the most vulnerable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refugee on Manus Island sought medical help 13 times in two months before he collapsed and died, the Senate heard this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other cases detailed to a Senate committee inquiry into abuse, self-harm and neglect in offshore detention - established after the publication of the Nauru files by Guardian Australia - a 70-year-old refugee with a heart condition waited 20 days for a doctor's appointment, and a child refugee on Nauru possibly suffering from sexually transmitted disease was refused a medical transfer recommended by a specialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Faysal Ishak Ahmed's life was full of pain. Australia had a duty to protect him | Behrouz Boochani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee heard evidence this week from senior immigration department officials about the standard of healthcare on the Australian-run offshore detention islands of Manus and Nauru, including details of the treatment and death of the Sudanese refugee Faysal Ishak Ahmed last December.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     International Health and Medical Services, the department's healthcare provider, is contracted to provide, in offshore centres, &quot;primary and mental healthcare services broadly comparable to Australian community standards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under questioning from the Greens senator Nick McKim, officials including the department's chief medical officer, Dr John Brayley, told the Senate that IHMS was meeting that obligation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the committee has heard evidence in submissions that for offshore patients the clinical opinion of doctors is regularly overruled, and that refugees and asylum seekers sometimes wait weeks or even months to see specialists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors for Refugees detailed the case of a child held on Nauru suffering suspected extra-pulmonary tuberculosis - or possibly yaws or syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease - who was recommended by a clinical professor in paediatric infectious diseases for transfer to Australia for further specialist investigation. The child was not transferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another child was assessed by an IHMS psychiatrist on Nauru as having significantly impaired speech, fine motor skills and &quot;global developmental delay&quot;. Doctors for Refugees strongly recommended an immediate transfer to Australia for specialist services but the child remains on the island and has not received specialist paediatric care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian Medical Association submission detailed the case of a 70-year-old Rohingya refugee who was sent to Port Moresby hospital for seven months, with &quot;very little treatment availble to him&quot;. He was then removed from the hospital without warning and taken back to the Manus detention centre, where he waited 20 days for a doctor's appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was diagnosed with a heart condition and high blood pressure. &quot;His symptoms included extremely swollen feet and legs, and being unable to walk or stand for longer than a few minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKim cited a submission from the president of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, Prof Anthony Lawler : &quot;ACEM considers there is no evidence that the healthcare provided in regional processing centres is at a standard which would be acceptable or expected for any patient in Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 22 December 2016, 27-year-old Faysal Ishak Ahmed suffered a seizure inside the Manus Island detention centre and fell, hitting his head. He was flown to Brisbane the next day but died on 24 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed saw a doctor the day before he collapsed but it is alleged he was told he was not unwell. He had sought medical attention in the detention centre 13 times in the two months before he died, the Senate heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labor senator Patrick Dodson told department bureaucrats it was deeply concerning that Ahmed could have presented to the Manus detention centre medical clinic so many times - &quot;up to 20 times&quot; in the six months before he died - &quot;and no one's come to a view that there's something seriously wrong&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brayley said: &quot;This case raises questions about diagnosis and decisions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A witness to Ahmed's collapse said he had been removed to the voluntary supported rest area - usually used to protect people experiencing mental health episodes - complaining of chest pains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Another patient heard him saying, 'I cannot breathe, my heart has stopped,' and shortly afterwards he fell down on his forehead with thick liquid and water came out through his nose and mouth,&quot; the witness said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Queensland coroner is conducting an inquiry into Ahmed's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he died, fellow Sudanese refugees inside the detention centre were so concerned by his repeated seizures and collapses that they wrote a letter outlining months of escalating health complaints which, they said, had been ignored by medical staff. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 15 December, exactly a week before he collapsed, Ahmed himself had written to IHMS, complaining his health concerns were being ignored. In broken English, Ahmed said he had chest and heart problems, and high blood pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day after Ahmed collapsed, while he was still alive, his compatriot refugees wrote a four-page letter to IHMS pleading with doctors to &quot;give him the kind of treatment his problem need[s] ... before its too late ... instead of hiding the facts from him&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They detailed seizures and breathing difficulties Ahmed had suffered since September. The letter alleged:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He saw a GP on the 21st of December 2016, and he was told by the GP there was nothing wrong was told that he was not going to be seen by any doctor again in the future and IHMS cannot help him anymore with that problem. When he came back from his appointment he was very much affected by the reply of the IHMS that they would not be assisting him in the future. He kept saying 'I swear, I am not pretending that this disease would kill me'. His condition got worse and worse on that day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter writers asked that Ahmed be treated immediately. &quot;We have got nothing in our power to help him, but we are kindly and humbly giving you this piece of advice so as to take it into consideration immediately before it's too late,&quot; they wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Happy Bloody Christmas: The True Story of Faysal, by Eaten Fish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brayley confirmed to the committee that Ahmed had repeatedly sought medical attention. He said he was restrained from publicly discussing details of Ahmed's treatment and death because of the coronial inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had presented to the health services at Manus Island on a number of occasions, and on the day of the critical incident, he collapsed suffering a head injury that we would believe to the be the cause of his death. He was then transferred to Brisbane for medical treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is one of a man who had presented 13 times for medical care from October 1, with some specific symptoms, had those symptoms assessed and then investigated, had this critical event with the head injury, and is now a matter that we need to internally review as part of our own quality processes, as well as the usual processes that occur with the coroner.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President&nbsp; Donald Trump &nbsp;slammed journalists who reported on a contentious call he had last weekend with&nbsp;Australian Prime Minister&nbsp; Malcolm Turnbull, suggesting the reports were 'FAKE NEWS.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Thank you to the Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about,' Trump wrote in an early a.m. tweet. 'Very nice.' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull and Trump were discussing a refugee deal, which was inked during the Obama administration and which the new American president widely panned.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaked details about the call revealed that Trump told the Australian leader, 'I don't want these people,' suggesting it was the 'worst deal ever' and that he was 'going to get killed' politically for following through on a resettlement agreement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also accused the Australian Prime Minister&nbsp;of looking to ship off the 'next Boston bombers' to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fuming President Trump reportedly told Turnbull that the conversation was 'the worst call by far' he had taken that day, after 'boasting' about pleasant exchanges with Russian President Vladimir Putin and three other world leaders.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early reports suggested that Trump hung up on Turnbull, but Turnbull told&nbsp;2GB's Ben Fordham: 'As far as the call is concerned, I'm very disappointed, the report the president hung up is not correct, the call ended courteously.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was their first official telephone conversation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, while Press Secretary Sean Spicer described the call as 'cordial,' he also talked about how much the new president despised this deal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump, he said, was 'unbelievably&nbsp;disappointed' and 'extremely, extremely upset' about the deal, which would bring in 1,250 refugees detained on Nauru and Manus Island into the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A week before, Trump had taken to Twitter to express his displeasure as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!,' he wrote.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump brought up the deal again yesterday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I love Australia as a country, but we had a problem,' Trump said, explaining how President Obama had agreed to resettle '1,000 illegal immigrants who were in prisons.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the top of a meeting Thursday with Harley-Davidson executives at the White House, Trump described the conversation with Turnbull, saying he continually asked the question 'why?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They were going to bring them and take them into this country and I just said why,' Trump explained. 'Why are we doing this? What's the purpose?'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did commit to follow through on the deal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'So a previous administration does something. You have to respect that. But you can also say &quot;Why are we doing this?&quot;' Trump said. 'That's why we're in the jams that we're in.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News sources claim Trump was 'yelling' at Turnbull at points during the heated conversation, which took place on Saturday afternoon Washington time, Sunday morning Australian time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT IS THE AUSTRALIA-US REFUGEE DEAL?                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration and Turnbull government struck a deal to resettle some of the refugees being held offshore in Nauru and Manus Island in November last year&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government has a 'zero tolerance' policy towards illegal boat arrivals and only genuine refugees are sent to Nauru and Manus Island&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are approximately 1,250 refugees being held in the Australian-funded offshore detention centres</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large majority of those refugees come from Iran, Iraq and Somalia - all countries on US President Donald Trump's travel-ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump agreed to honor the deal, on the condition the refugees would undergo 'extreme vetting'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US President reportedly described it as the 'worst deal ever' in a heated conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump indicated he was skeptical about what America got out of honoring the deal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Turnbull apparently suggested they move on and talk about foreign affairs, including the conflict in Syria, President Trump ended the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'During call with Australian PM on refugees, Trump pulled phone away from ear and says he wants off call, which ends abruptly per source,' CNN reporter Jim Acosta tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement reached with the Obama administration, Australian would take a number of South American refugees, currently in a processing center in Costa Rica, in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These refugees are predominantly Christian, according to reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to revelations of the hostile phone conversation, Turnbull remained tight-lipped on Thursday and said that he wasn't going to comment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's better that these things - these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky News reporter Laura Jayes said Australian government sources who took part in discussions after the call said Turnbull viewed the president as a 'bully'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What I derived from that was Malcolm Turnbull used this phone call to push back,' Ms Jayes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He wasn't just sitting there being berated by Donald Trump, he talked about how important it was for (Trump) to honor the deal.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosive report was viewed as a huge embarrassment for Turnbull, who has insisted in recent days the asylum seeker deal is solid and relations with Washington are fine.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and Australia have been close military and economic allies for generations, with Australian troops fighting alongside Americans in every military conflict Washington has been involved in since World War II.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is one of just four other countries the US shares security intelligence with under the Five Eyes alliance.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two countries have also shared a free trade agreement since 2005.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official statement about the phone call released by the White House told a different story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Both leaders emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally,' it said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull on Monday described the call as constructive, saying the pair acknowledged the already strong and deep relationship between the US and Australia and committed to making it stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That's my job. My job is to defend the national interest of Australia and defend the interests of Australians,' he told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You may wish to speculate about policies and politics in Washington, that's not my role. My job is today and everyday to stand up for Australia and that's what I do.&nbsp;'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also thanked the president for 'committing' to honor the refugee agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1.30pm (AEDT) on Thursday the US Embassy in Australia released a statement that the deal would go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'President Trump's decision to honor the refugee agreement has not changed and Spokesman Spicer's comments stand,' a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this Embassy at 13:15 Canberra time.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it came after a morning of mixed messages from various official sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday it was reported that the White House had backtracked on the asylum seeker deal, saying that President Trump was still considering it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said the deal had not been confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if it were to go ahead, it would only be because of the United States' 'longstanding relationship with Australia,'&nbsp; The ABC  reported.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         'CRUEL, INHUMAN AND DEGRADING': UN HITS OUT OVER 'OPEN-AIR PRISON'                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has been heavily criticized by the UN for its policy of sending migrants to offshore detention centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November UN investigator Francois Crepeau visited the island of Nauru, where asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent, and described conditions as 'cruel, inhuman and degrading'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Crepeau said Australia's policies 'have increasingly eroded the human rights of migrants in contravention of its international human rights and humanitarian obligations'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he continued: 'Australia would vehemently protest if its citizens were treated like this by other counties and especially if Australian children were treated like this.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International said in October that the immigration center was an 'open-air prison'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes just one day after Spicer told reporters Trump would honor the 'one-off' deal with former President Barack Obama in November to resettle refugees detained on Manus and Nauru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Part of the deal is they have to be vetted in the same manner that we are doing now.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Trump placed a temporary ban on refugees being admitted to the US and other strict border measures targeting seven countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Trump confirmed his administration would continue to honor the 2016 refugee resettlement arrangement while acknowledging a common interest in preventing irregular and illegal migration.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The president, in accordance with that deal to honor what had been agreed upon by the US government, and ensuring that vetting will take place in the same manner that we are doing it now, it will go forward,' Mr Spicer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are being held on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and Nauru.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters at the G'day USA gala in Hollywood, Ms Bishop said Mr Turnbull would travel to the US for a yet to be scheduled meeting with the president.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     TOUGH IMMIGRATION LAWS WHICH SEE 'BOAT PEOPLE' SENT TO OFFSHORE CAMPS                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offshore detention in Australia has been in place since 2001, and in 2013 Australia's mainland was excluded from its migration zone for people who arrive by boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now migrants who arrive on Australian shores by sea are immediately sent to the island of Nauru or Papau New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stay in detention facilities while their applications to be accepted into Australia are processed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although 90 percent are ruled to have valid claims, they are not allowed to settle in the Australian mainland, instead being allowed to stay in Nauru or Papau New Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy has come under heavy fire, with conditions in the camp branded 'inhuman' by a UN inspector in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters claim it deters migrants from arriving in dangerous vessels, and ensures refugees enter the country through proper channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015 Australia agreed to accept 12,000 refugees from Syria.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous year violence had erupted at a protest at the detention center on Manus Island, and a 23-year-old Iranian man was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull has previously stated that Australians cannot be 'misty-eyed' about immigration, saying: 'We must have secure borders and we do and we will, and they will remain so, as long as I am the prime minister of this country.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German police have arrested a second soldier over a far-right plot to assassinate politicians and blame it on migrants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect, identified only as Maximilian T., 27, was stationed at the same Franco-German base near Strasbourg as army lieutenant Franco Albrecht, who was arrested on April 26.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albrecht, 28, had managed to create the false identity of a Syrian fruit seller from Damascus and to register himself as a refugee who was granted asylum, a space in a shelter and monthly state benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their plan, prosecutors claim, was to commit an attack, for which they had obtained a pistol and drawn up a hit list of pro-refugee politicians, including former president Joachim Gauck and Justice Minister Heiko Maas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair, along with 24-year-old student Mathias F., had hoped the murder would 'be seen by the population as a radical Islamist terrorist act committed by a recognised refugee,' said a statement from the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said the three suspects 'planned an attack against a high-ranking politician or public figure who was supportive of what the accused saw as the failed immigration and refugee affairs policies'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albrecht 'was meant to carry out the attack' and had created the fictitious identity of a refugee who was meant to be seen as the perpetrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maximilian T., who served in the same infantry battalion, allegedly made excuses for him during his absences from the Illkirch base,&nbsp;just across the border from Kehl in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He apparently penned the death list, and helped Albrecht procure the French-made handgun in Vienna, prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News portal Spiegel Online said the newly-arrested suspect was also a lieutenant and a close friend of Albrecht, and that both were part of an online chat group in which they shared right-wing extremist content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair also allegedly traded Nazi photos and far-right speeches online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One investigator told Spiegel: 'They were prepared to kill for their cause, or at least that's what they claimed.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Albrecht's arrest at a Bundeswehr barracks in French Alsace, investigators said they found a lounge where he and like minded officers shared their enthusiasm for the Nazi Wehrmacht.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called their retreat the 'bunker' and there they stored pictures romanticizing World War Two German troops alongside original steel helmets, guns and medals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case is particularly shocking for the military leadership, because German soldiers have only been stationed in the Leclerc barracks in Illkirch since 2010, so there are no historical roots to the Wehrmacht.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Anyone who decorates an entire room with devotional objects in such a barracks must be deeply convinced,' said Germany's MoD in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012 at the site soldiers made a huge four foot swastika on the ground outside a training site.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence Minister Ursula von Der Leyen this week ordered the army's inspector general to search every army barrack, storeroom, munitions depot and training area in a bid 'to restore the reputation of the Bundeswehr.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has come under fire for her handling of the case, with some saying her harsh tone towards the armed forces&nbsp;implied most soldiers were right-wing radicals.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chancellor Angela Merkel defended the minister today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the broadcaster WDR: 'This is an unbelievable story with a right-wing extremist background and it was right that the defence minister did not try to minimize it but rather called it what it is, and we say we have to investigate whether such thing occurs often.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Von der Leyen has apologized for her blanket criticism of the military, saying she regretted remarks that military leaders were weak and unable to deal with problems like sexual harassment claims and right-wing extremism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scandal has also raised questions about the competence of staff at shelters where migrants first register before they can apply for asylum.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany has taken in more than one million asylum seekers since 2015, many from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, amid an initial wave of goodwill followed by an anti-foreigner backlash and a spate of racist hate crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MATT BROOMFIELD</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 21</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1669 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child refugees in Paris live in conditions &quot;as bad as the Jungle&quot;, one teenage veteran of the Calais camp tells The Independent. But rather than being concentrated in one squalid location, frequent police raids mean hundreds of children are spread throughout a web of ramshackle camps, dangerous squats and unsanitary hostels in the French capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are less visible, more isolated and at the mercy of a bureaucracy that offers little or no protection as it demands often-impossible proof of age. The Independent followed their route through the boulevards of the City of Light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bulldozing of the Jungle is not the only factor driving children to Paris. A canary-yellow processing centre, known locally as &quot;the Bubble&quot;, hosts a rolling total of around 400 adult asylum-seekers in a sparse industrial area north of the city centre. According to Marion le Bloa, a front-line volunteer with aid organisation Utopia56, &quot;when the Bubble was created, the number of unaccompanied minors went crazy - it doubled&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of would-be and failed asylum applicants live nearby, in bedraggled, ad-hoc camps built of tarpaulin and cannibalised building materials. Omar, an Afghani 17-year-old who fled the Taliban aged just 14, tells The Independent he arrived on the previous night after stowing away on a train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was in a camp in Norway for nearly two years,&quot; says the softly spoken, acne-flecked teen. &quot;With only a bed, nothing else. There were fights every day. I heard Norway were giving negative [asylum decisions] to [almost] everyone from Afghanistan, so I left before the police came in the night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing increasingly harsh treatment elsewhere in the continent, others have left Italy, Belgium or Eastern Europe. Around half of refugee children in Paris are trying to get to Britain: many speak English but no French, and have relatives working in the UK. Pierre Henry, the chief of major aid organisation France Terre d'Asile, says: &quot;This is a problem for all European countries. We need to establish who is going to fund the determination process [and take] responsibility for these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teenagers aren't actually allowed to stay in the Bubble - it's for single men only - and those who say they are not 18 are sent onward to face a battery of interrogation and bone tests, as the local government assesses their claims to be underage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said you don't have any proof, and sent me outside,&quot; says newly arrived Siddiq, 16, outside the shabby Red Cross centre where child refugees must file their applications. He stands in neutral position, arms loose by his side and evidently unsure of his next move. The majority of arrivals are turned away outright, or told to submit to weeks of investigation. &quot;I am alone,&quot; Siddiq says. &quot;Where will I go now? Sleep in the road?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Afghani 17-year-old, Rahman, enters the security gate but is immediately driven back by a trio of bulky security guards wearing Mairie de Paris insignia. &quot;I've been coming every day for a month,&quot; he says. &quot;Everybody is angry to us here, the security are very hard. For my first two weeks in Paris, I was sleeping under a bridge. The security [just] told me I'd be thrown out of my hostel if I didn't leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre has a reputation for harsh treatment of minors. The crucial bone tests are only accurate within &quot;more or less two years&quot;, according to a radiologist's survey, rendering them effectively useless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marion of Utopia56 says many children are terrified of attending their interviews, while other volunteers claim translators misrepresent the stories of refugees as investigators aggressively pursue irrelevant details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an activist named Sonia, &quot;One boy said he was scared of being kidnapped by the Taliban??? the translator said 'he wanted to be a terrorist'. It's directly the opposite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor are children always provided with adequate housing during this process. &quot;We have to leave every day with all our bags and move all the time,&quot; Rahman says. &quot;They only give us food once a day.&quot; Other refugees and activists describe hostels without blankets, but full of fleas and bedbugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Rahman is one of the lucky ones. There is not always room in the hostels, which are also closed to children appealing their decisions. So &quot;at least hundreds&quot; of unaccompanied children live on the streets, according to volunteer Agathe, making it even harder to access a fair hearing. Seventeen-year-old Guy tells The Independent he fled the Ivory Coast, leaving behind his mother in a Libyan jail, only to miss a crucial assessment because he was sleeping in a building site without a mobile phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Paris city authority which operates the 'Bubble' said every effort was made to protect vulnerable refugees, but added that determining whether or not they were under 18 could be &quot;complex&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted that in the past few days makeshift camps had started to pop up around &quot;the Bubble&quot; because the state had not been quick enough to send people from the temporary centre to permanent structures around the country, and said the process was being speeded up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very rare that refugees and migrants travel without any form of documentation. Everything is put in place to ensure children are immediately taken care of,&quot; the spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there should be a distinction between those who are minors and those who say they are but are not. The refugee process is made much easier if someone can prove they are under 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes refugees continue to claim they are minors even if they have been found to be over 18 and they deny an existing situation. This is a complex problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of constant police harassment, camps are transient and thinly spread across the city in metro stations, under flyovers and on the roadside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people in Paris are nice; the police are not,&quot; says Omar, 16, a refugee from Darfur who spent a fortnight in the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 20 per cent of child rough sleepers have faced physical abuse from Paris police, and roughly 40 per cent have been hit with tear gas, according to the charity Refugee Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid organisations are forced to operate outside the law, with the police frequently closing down soup kitchens and distribution projects. Volunteer Catherine says: &quot;We come at night with tents and blankets, we throw them out of apartment windows. It's crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside Jaures metro station, a scrappy line of cardboard abuts an office window. Through the smoked glass, workers can be seen tapping away on computers, apparently oblivious to the armed police moving on a gaggle of Afghanis who have been sleeping there for several days. Most are adults, but among their number is 17-year-old Qaher, who has been in the streets for 20 days since launching an appeal. &quot;We live like animals,&quot; he says. &quot;We've eaten once in 24 hours. The cold and the rain is normal for us. We don't have anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The streets around la Chapelle metro station provide a vision of the future for children like Qaher, who cannot prove their age. Undocumented adult migrants sell fake iPhone cases and weed in cigarette boxes: armed police search a young man for drugs: a paraplegic with flip-flops on his hands drags himself onto the metro to beg for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though 96 per cent of child refugees arrive in Paris unaccompanied, those coming with family members are at risk too. Speaking near la Chapelle, Nasrat says his brothers, aged 14 and 11, rely on him for support. But though Nasrat was a translator for the American-led coalition in Afghanistan, his asylum application has been rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I take them to school and bring them back, I cook for them,&quot; says the 26-year-old. &quot;Somebody from my family needs to be with them. They are always crying about what they saw on the way here. Sometimes I lie to them, [saying] we will stay here no problem. I don't have any other way. If I don't lie they will cry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For unaccompanied minors, the only real support is provided by overstretched networks of grass-root organisations and private individuals. &quot;Most of the people on the street are supported by small groups of people, working together??? the big organisations aren't doing nearly enough,&quot; says Cecelia of Solidari-Th&eacute;, an organisation distributing tea and vital information outside the Bubble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups praised by child refugees themselves include Utopia56, support network BAAM, and a Facebook group offering direct phone credit top-ups to help refugees contact their families and attend vital appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual volunteers have taken in scores of teenagers ignored or abandoned by the authorities to sleep and in their apartments. Fourteen-year-old David fled domestic abuse in Guinea, and lost half his body-weight as he crossed the Sahara, filtering filthy drinking water through his shirt. &quot;It was a little dangerous,&quot; he says quietly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After two weeks on the street in Paris, he was taken in by Catherine, who is called &quot;mama&quot; by the half-a-dozen teens from Francophone Africa gathered in her small apartment. They play West African R&amp;B, Mr Bean and the Marseillaise through her laptop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most move on to try their luck in other cities or countries when their applications are rejected or a hostel space opens up. Some have secured temporary 6-month leave to remain. All those still in Paris come back to Catherine for showers, hot meals and company. &quot;I'm a single mom with two kids, I don't have a big house. If I can do it anyone can,&quot; says fellow volunteer host Avril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This highly informal network cannot help everyone, though. &quot;Sometimes I have to say 'there's no room,'&quot; says hosting coordinator Sonia, who turned away a 15-year-old only yesterday. Only one child spoken to by The Independent has managed to access the French education system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the police come closer, Qaher and the other Afghan refugees outside Jaures metro station gather together their few belongings. &quot;We're not allowed here any more,&quot; he explains. &quot;We have to go.&quot; Then he trudges off into the drizzle, doubled over below his rucksack and blanket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Names have been changed to protect the identities of child refugees</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXIT WEST ***** by Mohsin Hamid Hamish Hamilton, &pound;14.99 EXIT WEST is a powerful, tightly written novel about nationhood and personality. We are &quot;all migrants&quot; in Hamid's words. The central metaphor is one of doors which open on to different worlds, taking characters from Amsterdam to Brazil, from the Middle East to a winter beach on Mykonos and from London to a refugee settlement on the outskirts of San www.Francisco.No physical journeys are described, just the hopes and fears the characters experience as they walk through black doors not knowing where they may end up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The narrative begins in an unknown city on the brink of civil war. Young advertising man Saeed is intrigued by Nadia, a fellow student at an evening class. Both are university-educated professionals working at jobs with potential although Nadia is irreparably estranged from her family by her decision to live independently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saeed still prays while Nadia wears a floor-length black robe, not out of religious belief but to keep men at arm's length. Their relationship blossoms but is almost immediately overshadowed as the city is paralysed by a militant insurgency. Saeed's mother's head is blown off as she searches in her car for a lost earring and Saeed and Nadia retreat with his father to the family flat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flight is the only possible hope for the future, so Saeed and Nadia make their way via Mykonos to a luxury house in London where they squat along with other refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are surrounded by armed police, supported by tanks. They are objects of hatred. Despite fleeing their homeland &quot;the basic reality of their predicament&quot; is unchanged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamid, shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for The Reluctant Fundamentalist, describes one of the most compelling and dangerous issues of our time. He looks unflinchingly at the worldwide refugee crisis, seeing it for the most part from within, as the refugees struggle to maintain their humanity without the basic trappings of life which most of us take for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a sobering novel yet one which despite its horrors is shot through with love and hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIRDCAGE WALK **** by Helen Dunmore Hutchinson, &pound;18.99 HELEN DUNMORE is prolific, her reach wide both in themes and historical settings. She has written about D H Lawrence when he was suspected of spying, about an unstable soldier's return home after the First World War, the Cold War and, in two novels of searing power, the Siege of Leningrad and its aftermath. All Dunmore's novels grip the reader through her imaginative power and ability to look uncompromisingly at human failure. In Birdcage Walk she moves back in history to the time of the French Revolution but her true subject is how people vanish from the historical record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unnamed, lonely man stumbles across the grave of radical pamphleteer Julia Elizabeth Fawkes in a Bristol graveyard. &quot;Her words remain our inheritance&quot; is the legend on the grave. But he has never heard of her and determines to find out more about this woman who died more than 200 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scrap of a letter discovered in a house where she may once have lived is a trigger for a story in which Julia's daughter Lizzie is the main player. Lizzie comes to life as a divided, perplexed woman, at odds with her family and her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has married speculative builder Diner Tredevant who plans to erect a magnificent terrace of houses in Bristol. Lizzie is carried along by Diner's vision, relieved to have escaped the wordy discussions of her mother's radical friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Diner is as passionately possessive of Lizzie as he is of his dream of transforming Bristol and with it his fortunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak of the French Revolution leads to growing political uncertainty. As investment capital dries up, Diner faces ruin. But he is already a deeply damaged man, as Lizzie begins to realise after a woman comes looking for the grave of Diner's first wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a novel in which people disappear, leaving only traces of their existence. For Lizzie's mother, it is not her work but a small baby who is the only solid legacy following her death. Lizzie struggles to care for the child as the dangers unleashed by the revolution come closer to home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compelling as ever though the writing is, Birdcage Walk seems less original than some Dunmore novels. But she still outshines most writers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM THE HEART ****by Susan Hill Chatto &amp; Windus, &pound;10.99 SUSAN HILL impresses with the sheer variety of her work which ranges from the Gothic drama of The Woman In Black, made into a stage play that has been running for almost 30 years in London, to her pacy Simon Serrailler detective novels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her latest is an understated but intense little gem. Deftly and in few words, Hill evokes the late 1950s when unmarried pregnancy and same-sex love held unbreachable stigmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olive Piper is an only daughter whose chilly mother wanted three sons. She has inherited some of her parents' detachment and although she is liked at school and at university she is never at the heart of a group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A voracious reader, she is intellectually sophisticated but ignorant of life and finds herself pregnant after a night with her boyfriend Malcolm Crowley. Olive decides to go it alone at a maternity home for unmarried mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some of the most moving scenes of the book, Hill describes the plight of the young women in the home. The atmosphere is antiseptic and unforgiving and the women are kept in ignorance of what to expect, separated from those who have already given birth in case they are fed &quot;horror stories&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numb from the pain of giving up her child for adoption, Olive completes her studies, takes a job teaching and is delighted to discover the ability to bring books alive to her pupils. Her joy attracts one of her senior colleagues. But the relationship is doomed from the outset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The novel is at times almost unbearably painful as Olive attempts to make sense of a world for which she has been poorly prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A short but stunning achievement on Hill's part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LARCHFIELD **** by Polly Clark Riverrun, &pound;14.99 THAT Polly Clark is a poet is never in doubt throughout this imaginative novel, written with poetic force. It focuses on two poets, one real, the other fictitious (the latter clearly based on Clark's own experience) who find themselves at sea 80 years apart in the Glasgow suburb of Helensburgh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both are outcasts. The real poet is WH Auden who, newly out of Oxford, takes up a teaching post at boys' prep school Larchfield in Helensburgh in the early 1930s. He is already a published poet but is regarded by fellow staff, parents and school governors with suspicion, all of them subliminally conscious of his homosexuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet it is the Adonis-like master, &quot;locked into the governor's family like a jewel in a safe&quot;, who is the real threat to the small boys in his charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapters about Auden are intercut and occasionally overlap with those about poet Dora Fielding who, heavily pregnant, has moved to Helensburgh with her architect husband Kit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Kit the move is a return home but not for Dora, left alone each day with her premature baby. Dora has apparently incurred the wrath of the upstairs neighbours who are local church leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems to Dora that they park their cars to block out her light, encourage children to play on her lawn, spy on her and report her to social services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kit fails to understand, making Dora feel she is losing her mind and she is only partly sustained by her love for her child and by the discovery that Auden had also found himself in exile in Helensburgh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What she experiences is &quot;an emptiness, a nameless grief&quot; as she strikes up imaginary conversations with the poet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a beautifully constructed novel with a wealth of detail and characterisation. Moving and wonderful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALL THE BELOVED GHOSTS **** by Alison MacLeod Bloomsbury, &pound;16.99 THIS is a collection of varied stories which range across time and place from 1920s Nova Scotia to the Broadwater Farm riots in 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacLeod moves between fact and fiction, introducing well-known people including Sylvia Plath, Anton Chekhov and Tony Blair who is captured in a citizen's arrest. One story tells of cardiac specialist Denis Noble awaiting a heart transplant. Professor Noble, MacLeod tells us in her acknowledgements, is a friend of hers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This blurring of reality and imagination gives the stories an unsettling quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mundane and the extraordinary are close bedfellows. A young woman comes out of mourning and buys a beaver coat for a dance, an act with epic consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unhappiness of one narrator's marriage makes her think of her idol Princess Diana. The title story is a tribute to the last Bloomsbury survivor, Angelica Garnett, who reimagines her childhood at Charleston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories exercise a hypnotic effect, providing a kaleidoscope of life, colour and anguish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To order any of the books featured, post free (UK only), please phone The Express Bookshop on 01872 562 310.

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal court has granted an emergency stay  blocking the deportation of migrants detained at airports around the United States due to Donald Trump's immigration ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal court for the Eastern District of New York issued the stay Saturday evening after only two of 12 refugees held at JFK airport were released, after 14 and 24 hours respectively. The ACLU had filed a petition on their behalf, but the stay is effective nationwide. Under the stay, none of the travelers held at airports across the nation can be sent back.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on Saturday,&nbsp; Donald Trump defended his new  immigration &nbsp;measures, which prompted outrage as migrants were barred from entering the United States, including families of refugees, legal permanent residents and Ivy League students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president denied that his executive order, which bars refugees and citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US, was a Muslim ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He maintained that the ban was 'working very nicely' while chaos broke out in airports as migrants were stopped and some non-American citizens realized they were now barred from the country where they were studying or had lived, perhaps for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's comments came as seven refugees bound for the US were stopped from boarding a plane in Cairo on Saturday and 12 migrants were detained in New York overnight because they arrived just after the executive order was signed, prompting a massive protest and a cab strike. Additional reports of dozens of people being stopped from entering the US or booted off airplanes have been pouring in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's not a Muslim ban, but we are totally prepared,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Saturday afternoon, according to The Hill.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's working out very nicely. You see it in the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely and we are going to have a very, very strict ban and we are going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panic broke out after Department of Homeland Security issued a directive at 4:30 pm on Friday enforcing Trump's executive order to close down the borders to refugees and visa holders from a list of banned Muslim-majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Iran, the other countries on Trump's blacklist are Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of people being detained were coming from all around the United States on Saturday. 'They're literally pouring in by the minute,'&nbsp;director of the International Refugee Assistance Project&nbsp;Becca Heller told the New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 50 people were held at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, USA Today &nbsp;reported. Fifty people were also detained at Dulles International Airport, where protesters gathered. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and Attorney General Mark Herring have said the state could take legal action against the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Yale student said he would be unable to attend the prestigious Ivy League university. Another student from the Massachusetts Institute Of Technology said he was barred from boarding a plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Stanford University student, a Sudanese national and legal permanent resident with a green card, was held for eight hours at JFK before being able to return to California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian scientist was meant to fly to Boston to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard but has now had his visa suspended indefinitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,' Professor Thomas Michel, who was going to supervise the student, told The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 13 people were detained at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, KUOW  reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two families of six from Syria were affected. One was supposed to relocate to Cleveland, Ohio, after having to flee their home in 2014. But their trip has now been canceled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another family of six from the war-torn country was detained at Philadelphia International Airport Saturday morning even though they had required legal documents and approved green cards and visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plane passengers were turned away in Dubai and Istanbul, including at least one family who got ejected from a flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four legal permanent residents with green cards coming home to Atlanta from Iran were detained, an attorney told WSBTV reporter Matt Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout from Trump's immigration crackdown grew on Saturday.&nbsp;The visa ban sparked fear for some refugees who were already on their way to the US when the order came into effect and were detained on arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear how many refugees or visa holders are already being detained across the country. Twelve refugees were held in New York City's JFK on Friday night. Cabs at the airport went on strike for an hour from 6 pm to 7 pm to protest against the ban. Travelers reported that police stopped allowing people without plane tickets onto the Air Train, which goes to the airport terminals, during the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor Andrew Cuomo, however, ordered authorities to let protesters onto the Air Train, saying in a statement relayed by ABC  that 'one of the fundamental rights that is granted to the people of this country is the right to peacefully protest'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqi refugees who was detained for 14 hours at New York, was released on Saturday afternoon. The second detainee,&nbsp;Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was released around 7 pm on Saturday after 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darweesh, 53, had arrived in America on a flight from Istanbul on Friday night, just hours after Trump implemented the immigration ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He&nbsp;had worked for the US government in Iraq for 10 years as a translator, engineer and contractor and had a valid special immigration visa to relocate to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alshawi, 33 - who was approved for a visa on January 11 - was flying to America to join his wife and son in Texas.&nbsp;'I'm sleepy and tired and exhausted,' he told the New York Post after being released Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darweesh pumped his fist in the air outside the airport following his release, as a crowd of supporters cheered him on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'First of all I want to thank the people that take care of me and support me. This is the humility, this is the soul of America,' he told a crowd gathered outside the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is what pushed me to move - leave my country and come here. America is the land of freedom... America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what he thought of Trump he said: 'I don't know. He's a president, I'm a normal person.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was travelling with his wife and three children at the time but they were not detained. They were heading to Charlotte, North Carolina to start their new life in America.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Darweesh and another Iraqi Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who is still detained at JFK, filed a lawsuit on Saturday morning in a bid to have them released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men were on separate flights when immigration officials stopped them on Friday night and took their passports when they landed in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHO EXACTLY IS BANNED FROM THE U.S?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That covers legal permanent residents - green card holders - and visa-holders from those seven countries who were out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban.&nbsp;They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customs and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas have been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S. Airlines are being told to keep them off those flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Source: Associated Press&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Cairo airport officials said seven US-bound migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's JFK airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the UN refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane on Saturday after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action at Cairo airport was the first there since Trump imposed the three-month ban on refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutch airline KLM says it had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world - that these people are no longer welcome,' Manel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the seven, who were from the seven blacklisted countries, were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's ban puts a 90-day pause on visas and immigration from seven countries including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also puts a 120-day ban on all refugee entries into the country and declares that refugees from Syria are not welcome until further notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that period of time, refugees will be accepted only from countries that the State and Homeland Security Departments decide are safe to work with.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban refugee entries from all countries for 120 days. Refugees can be accepted on case-by-case basis, including&nbsp;if they are a religious minority facing religious persecution</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspend visa issuance to countries of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official IRNA news agency carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry on Saturday that said Iran will resort to 'counteraction' to Trump's executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals,' the statement read.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg hit out at Trump condemning his anti-immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that,' Zuckerberg said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows reports that Muslim-majority countries with ties to Trump's business empire have been excluded from the order,&nbsp; Bloomberg  reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics show Trump doesn't have any business relations with the seven black-listed countries, but does with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order&nbsp;declares that US policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also&nbsp;gives Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year, according to the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order declares that the U.S. will 'prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution.'&nbsp;But that only applies when 'the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also affected by the order is an Oscar-nominated Iranian director, who won't be able to attend the Hollywood award ceremony due to the new immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated in the best foreign&nbsp;film category for his movie The Salesman but there are fears he may now not be able to attend next month's Academy Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His native Iran, which is where The Salesman was filmed, is one of seven countries listed in Trump's executive order that has placed a 90-day pause on visas and immigration to the US.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, tweeted on Saturday morning that&nbsp;Farhadi would be banned from attending the Oscars in what has become yet another fallout from Trump's immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Iran's Asghar Farhadi won't be let into the US to attend Oscar's. He's nominated for best foreign language film... #MuslimBan,' he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian-born actress who stars in Farhadi's The Salesman vowed to boycott the Oscars over Trump's immigration bans.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taraneh Alidoosti, the 33-year-old known as the Natalie Portman of Iran,&nbsp;took to Twitter&nbsp;with a message for fans on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest,' she tweeted.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences has backed the director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Academy celebrates achievement in the art of filmmaking, which seeks to transcend borders and speak to audiences around the world, regardless of national, ethnic, or religious differences,' it told EW  in a statement. 'As supporters of filmmakers-and the human rights of all people-around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar-winning film from Iran A Separation, along with the cast and crew of this year's Oscar-nominated film The Salesman, could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manus Island immigration detention centre will close by 30 June, with demolition of the first compounds to begin this month, detainees on the island have been told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday a man, purported to be a Papua New Guinean immigration official, told detainees to &quot;consider your options&quot; as migration and police officers had already commenced the shutdown process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Service will end and the demolition of remaining buildings will soon begin. Foxtrot compound will be the first to close, starting on 28 May,&quot; the man said in a recording obtained by Guardian Australia. He said the last compound would close by 30 June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You need to consider your options. No one will go to Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australian government downplayed risk of shots fired on Manus Island, analysis shows</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said those with refugee status could move into the PNG community, or temporarily into the East Lorengau transit centre. Non-refugees could return to their home country immediately, or reside in Mike compound until it too was closed and dismantled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once closed the electricity will be turned off and your buildings will be relocated. The area will be locked and nobody will be permitted to enter,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone will need to move out of RPC [regional processing centre] before it shuts down. Do not leave it too late to make a decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This applies to everyone,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said the US deal - struck by the Turnbull government and the Obama administration for the US to take up to 1,200 refugees from Manus and Nauru - remained in place and officials would conduct further visits &quot;in the coming months&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the detainees the closing of the RPC would have no effect on their refugee status, and told them to &quot;make decisions about your future&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have an opportunity to get on with your life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens senator Nick McKim said Australia had to bring the detainees to Australia. &quot;PNG does not have the resources to care for or resettle the men,&quot; he said. &quot;After four years of hell overseen by the Australian government, these men have now been given two weeks to make an impossible choice. This represents a shocking abrogation of our legal and moral responsibility for people who have reached out a hand and sought our assistance. The walls of the detention centre were the only thing between asylum seekers and heavy gunfire last month - now Peter Dutton wants to knock down the walls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKim travelled to Manus Island earlier this month but was denied entry to the centre, which he described as &quot;disappointing and frustrating&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April last year the PNG supreme court ruled the centre to be unconstitutional and the detention of asylum seekers illegal. Despite the order to close the centre, the timeline has been vague and littered with confusion, including a PNG chief justice declaring it already closed in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February an Australian government official said the centre would be closed by the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the supreme court ruling, some freedoms were granted to the detainees following the supreme court ruling, including the ability travel into the nearby town, but they remain in the same accommodation compounds, inside a restricted naval base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month detainees and staff cowered in rooms and fled into nearby jungle after Navy soldiers opened fire on the centre, injuring two people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting occurred after a conflict on a football field between detainees and soldiers escalated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian immigration minister has since repeatedly sought to connect the shooting to alleged community fears about detainees allegedly leading a young boy through the centre, but every authority on the island, as well as locals and detainees, have refuted his accusation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHRISTINA LAMB</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 11</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">971 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven Syrian brothers sit on the floor inside the trailer and fidget quietly. The living-cum-sleeping room, with just a few cushions and an old television set - for which there is electricity only a few hours a day - is spotless despite the dusty camp outside, and all the boys are neatly dressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From seven-year-old Hussein (sweeping) to 17-year-old Hasan (cooking), each has a task supervised by the eldest, Khalid, 19, who manages the 140 Jordanian dinar ((EURO)182) they get a month to live on, plus a little extra he earns as a guard in one of the camp schools.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khalid would prefer to be studying himself but has little choice. Their father disappeared at the start of the war in Syria and, in summer 2012, with their village under siege by the Syrian army, the seven boys and their mother, Wadha, fled across the desert to Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, in August 2015, their mother left alone for Germany, expecting to be able to send for them under the EU family reunification scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the closure of European borders to refugees, along with the failure of EU member states to take in more than a fraction of the 160,000 they pledged to resettle, has left the brothers among thousands whose families have been torn apart. Almost two years since their mother left, they remain stranded in Jordan's enormous Zaatari camp, waiting. Initially, the boys are shy about saying how they feel. Then Ehsan, 11, ventures: &quot;I miss a mother's love - someone who is good to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We miss her cooking,&quot; says Mohammed, 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss her because of everything!&quot; says Khalid, who found himself, then 17, head of the family when she left. &quot;I used to go to school and wanted to study business management but now it's impossible as I am responsible for the family.&quot; The camp has been completely transformed from the small collection of tents when they first arrived five years ago, like many, from Daraa, where the Syrian revolution started. Now Zaatari is one of the world's largest refugee camps, home to 80,000 people, with 12 mosques, 11 schools and its own football league.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many trailers have been painted with murals of everything from planets to pyramids in an attempt to bring some colour and cheer. But it is surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards, testament to riots and violence. Domestic abuse is common and the marriage of girls as young as 14 is on the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything is difficult about living in a refugee camp,&quot; says Khalid. &quot;We don't have electricity 24/7, only certain hours of the day, and in summer it gets very hot and water is very scarce. Also people don't have enough to do here, so they fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps hardest of all is the waiting. &quot;Every month I tell my brothers, 'Next month they will send us to Germany' ... I don't want them to lose hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2,500 miles away in D&uuml;sseldorf, Wadha Ahmad Alsamara misses her children desperately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I left for Germany because I thought my sons would have a better life here than in the camp, they could study and work, and also to get medical treatment for my youngest,&quot; she explains. Hussein lost an eye in an accident in Syria and his glass eye no longer fits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She travelled alone because she could afford only the $2,000 for one person and feared it would be dangerous. She had to go back into Syria and cross the war-torn country to Turkey. It took her three attempts in a smuggler's dinghy to cross the sea to Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am crying all the time,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought once I got to Germany I could bring the children quickly. Instead, they are stuck there and I am stuck here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef, the UN children's fund, has taken up the boys' case and last week Khalid had an interview at the German embassy, which gave him hope. But Wadha is still waiting to be granted asylum and has been told it might be another three years before the boys can join her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reuniting of families has been temporarily suspended by the German interior ministry - some believe deliberately until after the September election, since allowing families to reunite could mean another 2m people coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is true that asylum seekers who've been granted subsidiary protection are not able to apply for family reunification right now, because the reunification has been suspended for two years,&quot; confirmed Kira Gehrmann, of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. &quot;This doesn't, however, apply to asylum seekers who have been granted asylum or refugee protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet even those seem to have stopped. The delay puts further strain on Jordan and Lebanon, which have taken in most refugees. In Jordan, a quarter of the government's budget is spent on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with The Sunday Times Magazine today, Queen Rania of Jordan is critical of the EU response. &quot;Jordan is a small country, the size of Hungary, and we have taken in 1.3m Syrian refugees, whereas the whole of Europe has struggled to take in 1m,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Though I am really proud of the Jordanian response, it really pains me to see how much Jordanians have had to suffer and how high a price they have had to pay for the world's complacency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fate of broken families stuck in nowhere land will be raised by Unicef at the G7 summit on May 26 and 27 in Sicily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Unicef, by the start of this year only 9,940 refugees and migrants, including 3,310 children, had been relocated from Greece and Italy, a fraction of the 160,000 agreed by EU states in 2015. It is not known how many are family reunifications. Only 166 unaccompanied children have been relocated. Sarah Crowe, Unicef spokeswoman on the refugee crisis, said delays forced children to make their own way to join family members: &quot;In their desperation and frustration, children will take things into their own hands and find their own way through hell and high water, so often get caught in prostitution because the only currency they have is their bodies.&quot; @christinalamb</SPAN></P>

The problem is a lack of commercial landlords making properties available and I back the call of the Ottery group and East Devon District Council (EDDC) officers to find more suitable houses to accommodate more families.&quot;<BR><BR>Trevor Leahong, of the Ottery Refugee Response Group, welcomed the fact EDDC is set to settle a second Syrian refugee family and expressed a wish to support the authority in fulfilling its commitment to take more families in. <BR><BR>He added: &quot;We are concerned about the lack of progress in achieving this target given the vast number of Syrian families living in appalling conditions in camps in the Middle East and elsewhere. <BR><BR>&quot;Having spoken to a number of local estate agents and relevant landlords' associations, we believe that there are opportunities to find suitable accommodation if the request for housing is publicised more widely, if the terms offered to agents and landlords are attractive enough and if sufficient effort is put into working with them. We would urge EDDC to revamp its approach in these areas in order to meet the target.<BR><BR>&quot;We are also supporting the ABIDE community sponsorship scheme in Ottery. This is a community project overseen by Ottery Parish Church to sponsor the resettlement of a Syrian refugee family in the local area through a new Home Office initiative.&quot;<BR><BR>The &pound;10,000 raised by the community is kept in a restricted fund by the parish church to go towards the cost of supporting a refugee family for a two-year period.<BR><BR>An EDDC spokeswoman said: &quot;We have made an offer to the Home Office of accommodation for a second family. We are now awaiting the Home Office to take up that offer and to nominate a family. The council is part of the Devon-wide joint group, which is working together on issues such as how to attract more home owners to put forward properties for the scheme. We are currently looking for more suitable properties to house refugees and are keen to hear from landlords who would be interested in learning how they can help families who have already moved over here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report in English by website of Turkish pro-secular, mass-circulation daily Hurriyet on 1 February</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German Chancellor Angela Merkel will pay a one-day working visit to Turkey on Feb. 2 amid ongoing bilateral disagreements between Ankara and Berlin, with the German leader pursuing dialogue with Turkey due to the countries' increasingly strained relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and PM Binali Yildirim, as well as opposition party leaders, and visit the parliament in Ankara.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joint efforts to address the refugee crisis, cooperation in the fight against terrorism and economic ties are all expected to be on the agenda of the talks. Turkish nationals that have applied for asylum in Germany since a failed military coup in Turkey in July 2016 and accusations that Turkish imams in Germany have been involved in spying activities for Ankara will also be prominent in discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel under pressure over refugee deal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chancellor will face a tough election battle this year, amid staunch criticism of her open-door policy for refugees, which led to the arrival of 890,000 asylum seekers in the country in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During her visit to Ankara, Merkel is expected to renew support for the EU-Turkey refugee agreement to stop irregular migration. On the night of Feb. 2, the chancellor will participate in an EU summit in Malta during which the refugee crisis will be discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a Greek court refused to extradite coup suspects who sought asylum in Greece, Athens has expressed worries that Turkey may suspend the agreement with the European Union to stem migrant flows to the Greek islands. The issue is expected to be on the agenda as Greece is the main transfer route for illegal migrants to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel personally negotiated the refugee deal with former Turkish PM Ahmet Davutoglu and promised Turkey a visa waiver for its citizens as part of the original agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ankara has yet to meet the remaining benchmarks for visa liberalization, meaning the EU and Turkey failed to finalize the agreement by the end of 2016 as originally suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU is waiting for Ankara to submit a proposal that will outline its commitment to make certain amendments in Turkish legislation, including a change in the country's draconian anti-terror law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany accused of harbouring terrorists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ties between the two NATO partners have been strained by Berlin's concerns about the Turkish government's crackdown on dissidents, while Ankara has accused Germany of harbouring militants from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German lawmakers have encouraged Merkel to raise concerns about the Turkish government's crackdown on dissidents during her talks in Ankara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahead of the visit, Deputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak reiterated the Turkish government's accusations towards Germany, saying the country was &quot;harbouring every sort of terrorist that causes trouble in Turkey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, prominent actors of the coup plotters, its leg in the judiciary, are being harboured in Germany,&quot; he told Anadolu Agency on Feb. 1, likening the move to the Greek court's decision to refuse to extradite suspected putschists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erdogan earlier said he had handed Merkel 4,000 dossiers about &quot;terrorist&quot; suspects in Germany, but had received no response in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July 15 coup attempt has compounded tensions between the two countries, as the Turkish government's crackdown in response to the attempt prompted Merkel to caution Turkey to protect human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, dozens of Turkish soldiers and military personnel at NATO, including those with Turkish diplomatic passports and their families, have made asylum requests in Germany since July 15, 2016, according to German officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, a total of 1,700 Turkish nationals applied for asylum in Germany, but the number exceeded 5,700 in 2016, a spokesperson for the German Interior Ministry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkish authorities have sent a list of officials whose passports were cancelled, urging Germany to reject the asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ankara also wants Berlin to hand over two high-profile Gulenist prosecutors, Zekeriya Oz and Celal Kara, who are currently believed to be in the country. German police have twice conducted raids at the addresses that Turkey provided, but the suspects were not found there, a German official, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Hurriyet Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Invitation to Dundar a 'provocation'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ankara was also infuriated after the German Justice Ministry invited one of Turkey's most famous journalists, Can Dundar, to be a guest of honour at an official reception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Turkish Foreign Ministry called the move a &quot;provocation&quot; ahead of Merkel's visit to Turkey, given that Dundar is wanted in two separate probes. German President Joachim Gauck previously received Dundar, who was later given a high-profile media award in the German capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusation of spying clerics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's chief prosecutor launched an investigation into possible spying by Turkish clerics in the country, with the country's domestic spy agency chief saying they &quot;would not tolerate&quot; Turkish intelligence operations within its borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey allegedly asked Muslim imams that were sent to Ditib, Germany's largest association of mosques, to provide information about followers of US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, which the Turkish government accuses of orchestrating the failed coup attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehmet Gormez, the head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet), told German news outlets on Jan. 20 that it was &quot;devoid of reason to name the efforts of religious workers or Ditib to try to safeguard Muslims from the wrong thoughts of organizations like FETO and Daesh [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - ISIL] as espionage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 2016, Turkey recalled the religious affairs attache of the Turkish Embassy in The Hague, Yusuf Acar, after Dutch authorities accused him of gathering intelligence for the Gulen movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany refuses access to imagery from campaign against ISIL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany has also ruled out giving Turkey unfiltered access to imagery gathered by Tornado fighter jets operating out of the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey as part of the broader fight against ISIL militants, the Defence Ministry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German lawmakers, concerned that Turkey could use the high-resolution aerial imagery in its military campaign against autonomy-seeking Kurds, have put strict limits on how German forces can share the data they gather, Germany's Der Spiegel reported.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like most residents of this sleepy town of Moria, Vassilis Yannis has developed a new and dangerous bedtime routine. He seals the wooden shutters of his house, pushes a couch against its main doorway and cocks a hunting rifle, ready to face down any refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not taking any chances,&quot; the 80-year-old farmer said, drawing strong nods of approval from a group of men gathered at the caf&eacute; in the town centre. &quot;These people know no limits.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 4,000 asylum seekers in a squalid encampment beyond the olive groves of Moria. &quot;They have pissed on my lemon trees, raided my tomato patch and slaughtered almost every chicken, goat and sheep in the area, for food,&quot; Mr Yannis said. &quot;For months, we took this all in our stride because we are easy-going, caring people. But now they're breaking into our homes, robbing us and harassing our women. I won't stand for it. I'm ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is not alone. Spyros Galinos, the mayor of Lesbos, told The Times he would &quot;lead a war and popular insurrection&quot; if the government pressed ahead with plans to build more refugee camps to ease overcrowded facilities on the island. &quot;I'm not going to allow this island to turn into a prison,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other islands, including neighbouring Chios, have joined the revolt, insisting that the government relocate stranded asylum seekers. Since the start of the refugee crisis, the economies of Lesbos and Chios have been shattered. Last year tourist-related businesses suffered 60 per cent drops, among the biggest recorded across the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With migrants continuing to pour in from Turkey - the local authorities have recorded 96,378 arrivals on Lesbos alone, more than half of the 166,824 illegal entries since the start of 2016 - the standoff underlines how close Greece has come to becoming the powder keg of Europe's refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also highlights the flaws of a migration deal that the European Union struck in haste with Turkey last year to stop Europe's largest influx of people since the Second World War. Under its terms any migrant arriving in Greece would be sent back to Turkey, which would receive billions of euros from Brussels, and the EU would receive some refugees from Turkey once they had been granted asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the face of it the agreement has been a success,&quot; Benjamin Anoufa, of the International Rescue Committee, said. &quot;But while the immediate crisis passed and the torrent stopped, underlying problems have been left to fester because the European Union has turned a blind eye to addressing these issues effectively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a dramatic drop in the number of rafts arriving daily from Turkey, more than 15,000 remain on Lesbos, Chios and three other islands. All are forbidden to move to other parts of the country because of constraints imposed by the EU-Turkey deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ioannis Mouzalas, the Greek migration minister, urged the EU last month to amend the deal but Brussels refused to bend. It instead announced plans to start sending refugees back from western Europe to Greece before they are sent to Turkey, beginning in March. Turkey, meanwhile, threatened to open the floodgates to a new refugee crisis if the EU impeded its membership bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a mess,&quot; Mr Galinos said. &quot;But if the government cannot stand up to defend and safeguard its own people, then it will find me and the people of Lesbos first, fighting against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeal has backed a Zimbabwean sex offender's bid to stay in Britain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean national Wilfred Mosira was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a 13-year-old girl and jailed for a total of three years in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosira's offences, committed when he was 25, meant he faced deportation as a &quot;foreign criminal&quot; under the UK Borders Act 2007 and was told the then home secretary Theresa May intended to deport him on his release from prison.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His appeal to a first-tier immigration tribunal against deportation was rejected but an upper tribunal ruled in September 2015 it had not been open to Mrs May to withdraw his refugee status in the way she did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal also found, since his offending, Mosira now presented only a low risk to the public and there was not sufficient public interest justifying his removal under the rules of the 1951 Refugee Convention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilfred Mosira was jailed for three years for sex offences against a 13-year-old girl </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government lawyers asked three judges in the Court of Appeal - Lady Justice Black, Lord Justice Sales and Lord Justice Henderson - to overturn the upper tribunal decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lord Justice Sales said the tribunal had carried out a proper assessment of the case, taking into account the remorse shown by Mosira and the low risk he currently posed, and dismissed the Home Office appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;This is a case in which the legal analysis by the Secretary of State became confused at an early stage and was never reviewed and rectified.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It also became procedurally very messy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May was Home Secretary when Mosira's deportation was approved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosira came to the UK aged 17 in 2004 under a short-lived family reunion policy to join his mother who was previously granted refugee status because she was unable to obtain treatment in Zimbabwe for a medical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration authorities disputed his claims that he could not be returned to Zimbabwe as he would be in grave danger due to his political views, and complex legal arguments followed over the validity of his refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key reason the 31-year-old can stay is the Home Office lawyers argued he should be sent home because he would not face real persecution in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal Court judges said the Home Office case was 'messy'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the judges said Mosira had never been given refugee status on the grounds that he was in any danger in Zimbabwe meaning the lawyers had been making the wrong argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the reunion scheme operated by Tony Blair's government allowed children of refugees to be recognised as refugees themselves Mosira's mother was granted that status &quot;purely because of the lack of medical facilities available in Zimbabwe to treat her medical condition as HIV plus&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An upper tribunal saw evidence from a probation officer, who said in a July 2015 report that Mosira had made progress on an intensive six-month sex offender programme, there had been no further incidents and he was in a healthy and supportive relationship with a partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal ruled that on the available evidence he had rebutted the presumption that he constituted a danger to the community and his removal to Zimbabwe could not be justified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days after his arrival at the camp, the 16-year-old Afghan sneaked into a medical tent and took 350 painkilling pills, aspirins and multi-vitamins. He was comatose for 40 days. Three months later, his family said, he is on the road to recovery, receiving psychiatric treatment in Athens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 13,000 migrants and refugees trapped on Lesbos and four other Greek islands on the front line of Europe's refugee crisis, aid agencies have warned of rising rates of suicide, attempted suicide and self-harm among asylum seekers, including children as young as nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moria has been described by an aid worker as the &quot;worst refugee camp in the world&quot;. It has one block of toilets serving 3,000 people who have got through the winter in flimsy tents. Many are forced sleep on piles of rubbish, resulting in outbreaks of scabies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Lesbos alone one aid agency estimated that there had been a 366 per cent rise in suicide and self-harm over the past year. On other islands, including Chios, the rates were estimated to have doubled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is all indicative of the growing state of despair these people are in as they remain stuck in abysmal camps in abysmal conditions for months,&quot; Christos Dimopoulos, of M&eacute;decins du Monde, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies have documented numerous cases of asylum seekers using razor blades, broken glass and knives to slash their arms, wrists and necks. Some do so in response to grief and gloom, others to try to expedite their asylum applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 60,000 asylum seekers are stuck in some 50 state-run camps across Greece. Months after Qais's attempted suicide, Shabnam, his 36-year-old sister, tried to hang herself twice. Experts warn that an increasing number of minors - mainly boys - are being affected. &quot;A 12-year-old boy from Afghanistan would show up at our tent every day, showing us slits he had made on his hands and neck,&quot; Sacha Myers, of Save the Children, said. &quot;He said he wanted to die but it was clear he was acting out what was going on around him in the camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a third of those stuck in Greek camps are children and 5,000 of them are unaccompanied. &quot;They have all grown so despondent that they inflict pain on themselves to acknowledge their very existence,&quot; said Nikos Gionakis, a therapist at the Babel relief organisation, which treats traumatised refugees in Athens. &quot;The conditions of these people's stay must change, otherwise their crumbling mental states will deteriorate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation, experts warn, underscores the severity of migration-related trauma and how poorly the Greek government and the EU have handled the biggest migration since the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a landmark agreement with Turkey last year helped to stem the tide of refugees entering Europe, delays remain in the asylum process, creating an interminable wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, a 27-year-old Syrian refugee died after setting himself alight in protest at the asylum procedure. The incident, a video of which went viral, happened days after another Syrian refugee hanged himself in daylight in the port of Piraeus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Lesbos, M&eacute;decins du Monde recorded a two-and-a-half-fold increase in patients with anxiety and depression. Many of them, including teenagers, had started using drugs to cope with the endless misery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT WASN'T so long ago that the plight of child refugees was splashed across the front pages of every major newspaper in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experience of refugees coming to Europe, travelling from south to north and east to west, couldn't be ignored. When the tiny body of Alan Kurdi was washed up on a Greek beach even The Sun called on the Government to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government did respond - though not as quickly or strongly as many of us would have wanted. First they said they'd take in 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years - and redouble efforts in the Middle East to help those in need.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few months later, through an amendment to the Immigration Act, Lord Dubs' amendment was passed into law - aiming specifically to help lone child refugees who had made it to Europe. The universal expectation at the time was that Britain would take 3,000 of these extremely vulnerable children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, almost a year after the amendment was passed, there have been just 200 beneficiaries of the scheme - and the Government has just announced that it is scrapping it with only 150 more children set to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of excuses have been rolled out by ministers as to why they're ditching their commitment to those most in need. Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, said that the Government should avoid &quot;incentivising&quot; migration just after the PM said that Europe should be mindful of &quot;pull factors&quot; encouraging people to come to Europe. Such arguments don't stack up. These children have made their way to Europe because they are fleeing terror, with 30,000 unaccompanied children arriving in Greece and Italy last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they weren't faced with such extreme danger they wouldn't be in Europe in the first place. Last year 5,000 people died in the attempt to reach safety. As the poet Warsan Shire puts it: &quot;No one puts their children in a boat unless the water is safer than the land&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is that there is no good reason for stopping this scheme. For it to continue it would have required the Government to give local authorities more resources to welcome refugee children. There's no doubt budgets are stretched - and welcoming people into our communities does have a financial cost, but it's one that the Government can afford if the political will is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stark reality we're facing is that we have a Government led by a PM who has built her reputation on keeping foreign people out. Her interests lie in courting the editors of right wing tabloids - who very quickly reverted back to bashing migration after their short pro-refugee hiatus. With her increasingly clumsy handling of the Brexit process, and her mismanaging of an economy that continues to fail so many people, it's little wonder that she's desperate to distract attention. From sacrificing our economy at the altar of ending free movement, to locking out these child refugees, it's clear that Theresa May wants to be known as a Prime Minister who builds walls, rather than bridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Government tried to sneak out the Dubs U-turn late on the day before Parliamentary recess they clearly hoped to avoid too much publicity, but the backlash has been huge. From the Archbishop of Canterbury to Gary Lineker to the many city residents who have written to their MPs and signed petitions - the Government clearly misjudged the public mood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is a better country than we must seem right now to the rest of the world. From cosying up to the racist, sexist US president to pulling up the drawbridge to refugee children stranded in Europe - any hope we have of becoming a world leader on human rights in this time of uncertainty is fast fading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm deeply proud to represent a City of Sanctuary and I'm consistently inspired by the work done by volunteers who welcome refugees. When Theresa May says &quot;if you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere&quot; she doesn't represent Brighton and Hove. Of course we all have a sense of place - whether we're Brightonians, English, British or any other nationality - but we also recognise that ties of humanity bind us to people in need wherever they live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight for a compassionate refugee policy continues. The children's commissioners from the four British nations have written to the Government arguing against the Dubs U-turn, and thousands of people have signed petitions calling for a reversal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Parliament I will press the Prime Minister on the issue as soon as possible - and will continue to work with brilliant organisations like the Hummingbird project to support those in need. By continuing to be a beacon of hope in these dark times Brighton and Hove offers an alternative to Theresa May's little Britain - let's make sure she continues to hear the voices of those who believe in a welcoming society.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a tweet heard around the world: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's rejoinder to Donald Trump's repugnant Muslim travel ban that has sparked outrage around the world. &quot;To those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith,&quot; Trudeau tweeted on Saturday. &quot;Diversity is our strength. #WelcometoCanada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Trump has immediately stoked reactionary chaos, Trudeau has always struck the progressive posture. With fuzzy memes and messaging and photo-ops of him hugging refugees - and his predictably popular latest tweet - Canada's Liberal party has painted themselves as a welcoming government in a sea of rising intolerance. Praise from the international political and media class has flowed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's attack on refugees, and yesterday's murderous assault on a Quebec city mosque by a racist white nationalist, should indeed focus Trudeau's mind. But before we continue the bout of self-congratulation, let's get a few things straight. Start with the fact that, despite the horror unfolding south of the border, his government refused yesterday to commit to raising the country's refugee intake: asked to clarify Trudeau's twitter-diplomacy, the Immigration Minister stated that they were already &quot;doing our part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What exactly is our part? Just last month, the government quietly capped applications for private sponsorship of refugees from war-torn Syria and Iraq-after families and community groups brought in nearly 14,000 last year. The number now accepted? A mere one thousand. In other words, many desperate and endangered people will not be able to come to Canada, despite there being groups ready to welcome and host them. Sparkling in his symbolism, Trudeau has been desultory in his deeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the optics, Canada has hardly been a leader in openness among countries. The number of refugees it accepted last year totalled 38,000- ranking us a laggardly 20th, judged per capita, among industrialized countries. And of those refugees, nearly half were privately sponsored by citizens, not the government itself. Trudeau has outsourced his responsibility to ordinary people, but has not been shy to claim the benefits to his image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Trump's administration now unleashes a racist anti-immigrant agenda that will involve not just travel bans by massive surveillance and deportations, there is another crucial way that Canada could open the doors to endangered people-but is currently, under Trudeau, barring many of them. If an asylum seeker now in the United States showed up at the Canadian border tomorrow, they would not be welcomed: they might be turned away. Hard to square with Trudeau's tweet, isn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because Canada-under a so-called Safe Third Country agreement established by a previous Liberal government in 2004-doesn't accept asylum seekers who come to Canada via the US. If someone fleeing war or persecution lands first in the United States - deemed a &quot;safe country,&quot; a notion now dramatically unapt - they are barred from seeking refuge in Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were already instances of people risking their lives to cross the border to Canada. And now life for poor, racialized and Muslim people in the United States has gotten a whole lot more dangerous. But Trudeau has not shown any inclination to repeal this agreement and allow people to find safety in Canada: a petition with growing numbers demands he now urgently do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trudeau appears to be very good at saying exactly the right thing, at the opportune media moment-then doing very little to accompany it with meaningful action. If only virality could induce reality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those many desperate people who have had their hopes raised by media coverage of Trudeau's proclamations should be warned: don't expect an embrace at the airport. Expect detention or deportation. And beyond the border, not stuffed animals but stuffed suits from Canada's security or spy agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from being a genuine haven for refugees, Canada under Trudeau has continued policies - dating back to the odious Conservative government of Stephen Harper or well before - that make life for refugees fleeing to this country exceedingly difficult and dangerous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone deemed an &quot;irregular arrival&quot; to the country - as many desperate people are bound to be - are immediately jailed. Several thousand people every year in Canada - including hundreds of children - wallow in indefinite detention in facilities or maximum security provincial prisons. As if fleeing persecution were a crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunger strikes to protest conditions have been a regular occurrence: but instead of acceding to demands, the government has deported key strike organizers. These policies have been condemned by the United Nations-not the kind of international attention that Trudeau is used to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And far out of the sight of ordinary Canadians, a bureaucratic machine operated by security officials has ripped apart families and deported, often to lethal situations, a staggering number of attempted refugees: 100,000 people in the last ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These policies are presided over by Trudeau with none of Trump's venom, but the result is still exclusion, suffering and heartbreak. This is not the violence of overt hate. It is the violence of empty gestures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is a time to demand so much more. For so long, the right-wing has been doing exactly that. Demagogic politicians in Canada have stoked anti-Muslim and anti-refugee sentiments with extreme proposals for a &quot;barbaric cultural practices hotline&quot; or screenings for &quot;anti-Canadian values.&quot; This sowed the seeds for a gunmen's rampage on a mosque. It also meant that even when the right-wing lost particular policy goals - as Trump already appears to be on aspects of his Muslim ban - they still won another way: they dragged the political climate further to the right, transforming what is considered acceptable and possible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time for progressive movements to match right-wing assertiveness, but in the service of compassion and solidarity. Pretty words will not suffice: we must demand significant policy changes and a firm rejection of anti-Muslim ideology-including Trudeau outright condemning Trump's policies. Undocumented residents in Canada should be granted status and live without fear of mass detention and deportation; and borders should be opened to those refused asylum in the United States and many more living in danger elsewhere. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspiring rallies at airports across the United States over the weekend were followed today by protests in Canada surrounding US consulates and embassies in Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto. The demands are growing louder. Canada can become a refuge to the persecuted-but what we're seeing right now is still window-dressing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a clip from the president's interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), Mr Trump says that Christians in Syria have been &quot;horribly treated&quot; before going on to add: &quot;If you were a Christian in Syria, it was impossible, very, very tough to get into the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump signedan executive order on Friday that will suspend travel visas for anyone from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US. The order will affect people from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, reports suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Pew Research Centre,the numbers of Muslim and Christian refugees from all countries entering the United States were around the same last year. 37,521 Christian refugees entered the US during 2016, with 38,901 Muslim refugees entering in the same period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also signed an executive order telling government agencies to start planning for his promised wall between Mexico and the US, along with the hiring of 5,000 additional border patrol officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as his comments on Christian Syrians, Trump was trailed by the network saying that he had &quot;always felt the need to pray&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The office is so powerful that you need God even more,&quot; Trump said in attempts to signal his religious credentials. &quot;There's almost not a decision you make when you're sitting in this position that isn't a really life altering position, so God comes into it even more so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Mr Trump's Christianity has been questioned in the past, the same is rarely said for his Vice President, Mike Pence, who took to the stage at Friday's anti-abortion March for Life in Washington DC as the first Vice President to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the crowd, he said that the administration would &quot;work with Congress to end taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion providers&quot; and suggested that Trump's pick for the Supreme Court vacancy would also be anti-abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another trailer for the CBN interview, Trump said that he thinks Evangelicals &quot;will love my pick and will be represented very fairly&quot;, again suggesting that the nominee will come from America's religious right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interview will be aired at 11pm EST on Sunday, January 29th.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is continuing to support the Libyan coastguard despite accusations its members have killed refugees and attacked international rescue boats attempting to take them to safety, it has emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One organisation is pursuing a legal case against the force for allegedly causing the deaths of up to 25 migrants, while aid workers on another ship say they were shot at in a &quot;serious and worrying attack&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International also accuses the force of shooting, beating and torturing refugees who are caught trying to flee Libya and forced back to land, warning that EU nations supporting the operations risk fuelling &quot;rampant ill-treatment&quot; and violations of international law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the harrowing tales emerging from asylum seekers who survive the treacherous journey to Europe have garnered no public response from governments supporting the coastguard as attempts to slow boat crossings continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK is conducting a three-month training programme seeing Royal Navy personnel deployed to pass on &quot;naval expertise&quot;, including how to safely approach, board and inspect vessels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one humanitarian organisation accuses the coastguard of causing up to 25 refugees to drown when members boarded an overcrowded migrant dinghy and started beating people on 21 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Libyan navy representative told local television the Sea-Watch boat was not &quot;attacked&quot; but admitted there was an incident, claiming the NGOwas in Libyan waters - an allegation denied by the charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second potentially deadly incident involving the Libyan coastguard in months, following an attack on a M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) ship that was fired at and allegedly boarded as international staff took cover in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the Libyan navy claimed the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ship, marked clearly with MSF banners, is one of several humanitarian vessels conducting rescue operations outside of Libyan territorial waters as more refugees drown attempting treacherous journeys to Europe than ever before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passage between Libya and Italy has become the deadliest in the world, claiming the majority of more than 5,000 migrant lives lost in the Mediterranean Sea last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real total may be far higher, as the number who drown inside Libyan waters or wash up on the country's beaches is not routinely released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights found that migrants were being imprisoned, robbed, raped and subjected to force labour after &quot;dangerous, life-threatening interceptions&quot; by the Libyan coastguard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivors said they had seen coastguards shoot, murder and torture other migrants, leading the UN to urge Britain and other countries conducting training to ensure its &quot;human rights component is comprehensive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between Libya and other European nations have also been thawing, with Italy's decision to reopen its embassy in Tripoli sparking speculation it may be aiming to replicate the controversial EU-Turkey deal to slow crossings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DERBY MP caused fury in Parliament when she said people need to stop being so &quot;sentimental&quot; when discussing  bringing Syrian refugee children into the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pauline Latham, Conservative MP for Mid Derbyshire, made the controversial remarks in a House of Commons debate on Thursday when she said other governments across Europe should be looking after the children in their jurisdictions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She later retracted the comments saying her comments had been &quot;badly worded&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate was held following the Government's decision to stop a programme involving the transfer of unaccompanied children from France. The Government had been expected to take 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees  from camps in Europe - but instead closed the scheme after admitting only 350.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Latham said: &quot;These children are not under threat of murder, they are in safe countries, [and] the governments of those countries should be dealing with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the desperate situation  the Syrian people are in, they are in a pretty safe place in those refugee camps. They are being fed, they are being given a health service, and their children are being given an education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should stop being so sentimental and be looking at what is the best thing to do for these families and children - and that is keep them in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her comments caused anger among other MPs. SNP MP Chris Law, who was speaking straight after Ms Latham said he was &quot;shocked, actually, to hear the last comments about sentimentality&quot;. He said: &quot;Many children in Greece find themselves in detention centres where they're made to sleep in crowded, dirty, rat-infested cells, often without mattresses and are deprived of basic sanitation and privacy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is reported that some boys are  turning to prostitution to keep themselves alive. If I am sentimental for bringing this up, then I am very proud to be so because these are some of the basic facts.&quot; Ms Latham later retracted her comments. She wrote on Twitter: &quot;Fear I have been misconstrued in speech. Claimed we must think LOGICALLY not SENTIMENTALLY in order to do best for the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not good choice of words from me but misconstrued - I was trying to say we must think logically, not emotionally, to best help kids.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mid Derbyshire MP has also been involved in a social media spat with a Labour Derby city councillor following the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posting about an upcoming job fair in Belper, Dom Anderson responded to Ms Latham's Facebook post saying: &quot;I can't make it, unfortunately, I'll be indoors being sentimental about Syrian children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Latham  snapped back, saying: &quot;Well, Dom, I don't suppose you have seen or met a refugee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That  sparked Cllr Anderson to reply: &quot;Really? I went to Derby Moor and was lucky enough to share classrooms with them. I now proudly call them my friends and have watched with pride as people who witnessed terrible suffering including the murders of their parents in Srebrenica grow into wonderful people contributing to our  country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Feel free to doubt my credentials as a human all you like, Pauline _ but I'll take no lecture from you in compassion following your comments of late.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian prime minister has urged his EU allies to take in more refugees, saying the relentless arrival of tens of thousands of rescued people on Italian shores is putting his country under enormous strain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paolo Gentiloni spoke after 10,000 people were pulled to safety from the Mediterranean in the last few days alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an election due in less than a year, political pressure is building on his centre-left government to push for relief from fellow EU nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanked by EU national leaders and EU officials at a news conference in Berlin, Mr Gentiloni said the growing number of arrivals &quot;puts our welcome capability to a tough test&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy has already taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees in the last few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some estimates say 220,000 people could land in Italy by the end of 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a country under pressure, and we ask the help of our European allies,&quot; Mr Gentiloni said, when asked about a reported new Italian strategy of blocking Italy's ports to non-Italian NGO ships that rescue people from distressed dinghies and other unseaworthy boats off the Libyan coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While acknowledging that European nations take part in patrols to deter smuggling in the central Mediterranean, Mr Gentiloni said the job of caring for the refugees &quot;remains in one country only&quot; - Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to those who arrive, over 2,000 migrants have died trying to cross the Mediterranean this year, according to the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Italy's anti-migrant Northern League Party teamed up with the centre-right opposition forces led by former Premier Silvio Berlusconi and triumphed in several mayoral races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats, Italy's main government party, took an embarrassing drubbing in the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Italian towns say they just cannot handle hosting hundreds of refugees anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right-wing parties remind citizens that Italians themselves are suffering from high unemployment and a practically flat economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one port in Reggio Calabria alone, 1,066 people disembarked from the Save the Children rescue ship Vos Hestia on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them were 241 unaccompanied minors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 2015 to 2016, the number of unaccompanied minors doubled to more than 25,000, according to the Interior Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ship's rescued refugees came from Eritrea, Bangladesh, Somalia and several sub-Saharan nations of Africa and included a four-day-old boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six refugees had chicken pox and some 250 showed signs of scabies, so officials set up pressurised showers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's also concern that if Italy, a stalwart supporter of the EU, sours on Brussels because it feels abandoned on the issue, the EU's very survival itself could be compromised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Either the Union can shake itself up, or the fear is that it can collapse definitively,&quot; said Francesco Laforgia, a lawmaker in a leftist party that split recently from the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that Mr Gentiloni's government is mulling blocking Italy's ports to European NGO ships, which increasingly rescue refugees before EU Frontex military fleets or Italian coast guard vessels arrive, is a dramatic recognition that public patience is wearing thin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is no longer sustainable,&quot; Nicola Latorre, head of the Senate's defence commission, told the Il Messaggero daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously saving human lives remains a priority. But it's unthinkable that Italy does it all by itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on Thursday, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini backed Italy's stance and insisted that other EU countries share the burden of caring for refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, previous plans hatched in Brussels to make other EU countries take in a fixed number of people from Italy and Greece have failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several central and eastern European EU members - including large countries like Hungary and Poland - have flat out refused to take in a quota of the asylum-seekers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of almost 83,000 migrants who have arrived by sea in Europe so far in 2017, the vast majority have crossed the central Mediterranean between Libya and Italy - now the deadliest sea passage in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has claimed more than 2,000 lives since January, according to UNHCR figures, sparking fresh appeals for enhanced rescue operations and the introduction of safe and legal alternatives for a record 65.6 million displaced people around the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the Libyan civil war continues to rage six years after the UK supported the removal of Muammar Gaddafi, smugglers have set up a ruthless trade with migrants routinely kidnapped, ransomed, forced into labour, raped, tortured and sold at &quot;slave markets&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the Libyan coastguard was engaging in &quot;reckless conduct&quot; during operations to force migrant boats back to land - in violation of international laws against refoulement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recent incidents show how wrong it is for EU countries to entrust the lives of those in need of rescue to Libyan coast guard forces when there are safer alternatives,&quot; said Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at HRW, calling for Italian authorities who currently coordinate rescues not to hand over command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call was repeated by a group of rescue organisations including Sea-Watch, Jugend Rettet and Proactiva Open Arms, who said European plans to &quot;outsource control&quot; of the refugee crisis to Libyan authorities was not practical or legal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An open letter to mark World Refugee Day on Tuesday called on European naval forces to conduct rescues, stop boats being illegally pushed back to Libya, develop an impartial monitoring system and &quot;support and decriminalise NGOs rather than demonising them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities and aid agencies operating refugee rescue ships have been accused of aiding and even directly colluding with Libyan smugglers in the increasingly toxic debate,despite research finding no evidence to supportthe allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy, which is housing more than 190,000 asylum seekers in state-funded accommodation, has criticised other Europeancountries for failing to resettle asylum seekers and help rescue efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry that not everyone, including in Europe, has shown the same willingness to take people in [as Italy has],&quot; Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in a message marking World Refugee Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The refugee issue crosses national borders and involves the entire EU and is, in the end, a global phenomenon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian navy and coastguard picked up 41 per cent of migrants rescued at sea last year, NGO ships 26 per cent, and ships from the EU-wide Operation Sophia 25 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But during the first four months of 2017, the proportion of rescues conducted by NGOs has increased to 35 per cent, with Italian authorities carrying out athird and Operation Sophia carrying out just 16 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU leaders will meet in Brussels to discuss migration policy on Thursday, after arrivals to Italy jumped by a quarter year-on-year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the European Commission opened a legal case against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to take in asylum seekers under a 2015 plan to relocate migrants from Italy and Greece.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, there was a wholly unacceptable anti-Tory bias in the audience which the BBC invited to the televised general election debate on Wednesday. The left-wing audience clapped and cheered every time Jeremy Corbyn spoke but booed and jeered at all the other party leaders. These constant interruptions completely slanted the debate. The BBC's pledge to be independent, impartial and honest was disregarded.Kay Bagon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radlett, Herts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, The BBC has been accused of bias regarding the general election debate after the audience saved its biggest cheers for &quot;left-wing&quot; policies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has anyone considered that it might be because they actually preferred them? I don't know anyone in favour of having to sell their homes to pay the dementia tax, or slashing funding to the police service, NHS and schools, or who wants more cuts, low wages and zero-hour contracts.Julie Partridge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London SE15</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, I had applied numerous times to be in the audience for Question Time, but on applying had never even had an acknowledgment. I had the suspicion that as a middle-aged, middle-class professional who has voted Conservative all my life, I was always going to be disappointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the programme returned to Peterborough earlier this year, as a little experiment I embellished my application to state that I was a militant trade unionist train driver who wanted fracking banned and supported Brexit. Much to my amusement and annoyance I received an email inviting me to attend, which was followed up with phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without applying, I was then invited to another BBC debate on the Cambridgeshire mayoral contest.David Stoneman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huntingdon, Cambs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, I have wasted 90 minutes of my life watching six party leaders and a home secretary supposedly debating, in an adult manner, questions put by members of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their conduct was appalling: interrupting, talking across the allocated speaker, not addressing the question. The only surprise was that one of them did not say, &quot; . . . and my dad's bigger than your dad.&quot;Robert Henderson Smith</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manchester</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, &quot;Squabble&quot;? Did Theresa May, in declining to attend the debate, really say that a debate is a squabble? Her remark demonstrates a contempt for the very basis of parliament, for other politicians, for party leaders, for anyone with a differing point of view, and for the electorate.Simon Ainley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rugby, Warks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, The election debate was a disgrace to national politics and a vindication of the prime minister's refusal to take part in it - and if she had done so she would probably have been accused of doing a U-turn. I saw a set of squabbling and ill-mannered children, out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, if the audience was a fair reflection of the electorate, Labour should win on June 8 with a large majority.Leslie Watmore</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beckenham, Kent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, Theresa May has made this election almost entirely about the relative strength of her leadership qualities, and strives to avoid substantive examination of Conservative policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, her decision to stay away from the debate, and her wrong-footing by Jeremy Corbyn, who decided to attend, showed tactical gullibility on her part and strategic nous on his.Ven Gavin Collins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fareham, HantsREFUGEE STRATEGY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, The refugee camps across the world were there before the election was called and they will be there after June 8. A new parliament cannot be allowed to move on from the refugee crisis. Rather than crowding out our response to the global refugee crisis, discussions around Brexit should compel us to ensure that a post-Brexit Britain will be a welcoming and compassionate place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent report from the All Party Parliamentary Group for Refugees, &quot;Refugees Welcome&quot;, provides a helpful blueprint as to what the next government can do. There are politicians in all major political parties who care deeply about the plight of refugees, but refugees need an advocate around the cabinet table. We join calls for the appointment of a minister for refugees. We need a national integration strategy which extends the transition period for asylum seekers given refugee status from 28 days to 50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope that faith communities will use this election to build partnerships so that the whole of society can be involved in the welcome offered to refugees. The community sponsorship scheme is a real opportunity for faith communities to contribute to this welcome. We ask those seeking to represent us to commit to working with local and national government, and communities to ensure we take full advantage of the scheme.Rt Rev Paul Butler, Bishop of Durham, I, Bishop of Croydon and chairman of Churches' Refugee Network, I, Territorial Commander for the Salvation Army UK Territory with the Republic of IrelandAGE-RELATED DRUGS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, The plan to reward GPs for stopping unnecessary medication shows the naivety of some clinical commissioning groups (&quot;GPs will get 'bribes' for taking drugs from elderly&quot;, News, June 1). Those surgeries running high-quality services which regularly review the medicines of their patients are more likely to have identified treatments no longer required than those that have not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently I have an annual medicines review and an annual asthma review in which each prescription is checked. Also, no mention is made of GPs using cheaper, but equally effective, generic medicines. GPs with high levels of non-generic prescribing should be identified and helped to move away from the more expensive branded products.Prof Keith Neal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emeritus professor, Public Health</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Derby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, I am a member of our GP practice's patient participation group. Recently the practice employed a pharmacist part-time to assess patients on multiple (more than eight) repeat prescriptions. By combining, replacing, eliminating and generally spring-cleaning these combinations, the practice saved an estimated &pound;30,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously the revised prescriptions had to be issued by the GPs, but only on the basis of expert recommendation.Frederic Edgar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leamington Spa, Warwicks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, The idea of encouraging GPs to reduce medication to elderly patients in return for a &quot;commission&quot; equal to half the money saved would be the start of a slippery slope. GPs, along with other prescribers, should make their decisions solely on the grounds of clinical need.George Garside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AngleseyVISA-FREE RUSSIANS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, The &quot;hard-edged, rational&quot; policy noted by Roger Boyes (&quot;A Franco-German axis won't thwart Putin&quot;, Comment, May 31) is only part of the solution to the seemingly intractable Russia problem facing the EU. Soft power is also needed. Here the EU has considerable heft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The simplest and most elegant way to nudge Russia back towards its European roots would be for the EU (and UK for that matter) to introduce visa-free travel for Russian nationals, initially on a limited basis for, say, tourism and study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opportunity to experience Europe easily and cheaply at first hand would go a long way towards undermining the effect on ordinary Russians of the Kremlin's often vicious portrayals of the West, particularly among the younger generation, which is in significant part well-educated and outward-looking. In time, this would lay the groundwork for a shift in political sentiment.Peter Morley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London SE26DIGITAL PAINTINGS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, The debate over how much ancillary material and equipment should be provided alongside paintings and historical artefacts is not an either/or (&quot;Museum visitors seek refuge from digital world&quot;, News, May 31, and letter, June 1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Gem&auml;ldegalerie in Berlin, Pieter Breughel the Elder's famous Netherlandish Proverbs is displayed on its own, without extras in one room, while next door there is a computerised version which can be analysed and deconstructed at will, displaying the painting layer by layer, for instance, inserting different lines of sight, highlighting the arrangements of different elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visitors are free to explore the picture either way, or as in my case, both ways.Dr Steve Mills</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ManchesterMONEY TREES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, The four major problems facing this country are the balance of payments deficit, the NHS, funding education and coping with the social care of an increasingly ageing population. Amber Rudd laments the fact that there is no &quot;money tree&quot; to cope with these demands (News, June 1). She is wrong - there is, and it is called income tax. The quicker politicians realise this and grasp the income tax nettle the more likely these problems will be solved.Eric Ickinger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Felixstowe, SuffolkSAVING SALMON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, is right to identify three issues threatening the survival of wild salmon - commercial netting, agricultural pollution and predation by cormorants and goosanders (Letters, June 1). However, there is a fourth threat, and that is seals. Seals have no natural predators in British waters and the population has exploded in recent years. Culling is the answer, but the public outcry would make the badger cull look like a walk in the park.Sandy Pratt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dormansland, SurreyWATCH WORDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, James Crane refers to the word &quot;pollywash&quot;- &quot;a reflection from a watch face or other shiny object on a wall or ceiling&quot; (Letters, June 1). My father, born and bred in Plymouth, always called this a &quot;Johnny Noddy&quot;.Claire Cart</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comberton, Cambridge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, A &quot;pollywash&quot; was known in our household when I was a child, and indeed to my own children, as a &quot;jackadandy&quot;.Sarah Dodwell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ipswich, Suffolk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, Apropos evocative words, could anything be more topical than &quot;bafflegab&quot;? Chambers defines it as the &quot;logorrhoea of many politicians, officials and salespeople, characterised by prolix abstract circumlocution and/or a profusion of abstruse technical terminology, used as a means of persuasion, pacification or obfuscation&quot;.Tony Phillips</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir, I note that the &quot;water wings&quot; that allowed Gordon the Goldfish to float, consisted of a halved wine cork (News, June 1).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest was organized shortly after news emerged on Tuesday that Donald Trump intended to sign an executive order that would suspend the resettlement of Syrian refugees and temporarily halt entry into the country for citizens of certain Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East and Africa, including Syria, Iraq and Iran. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move was widely seen as a fulfillment of Trump's previous pledge to implement a ban on Muslims entering the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive order is expected to be signed later this week. The Guardian has obtained a draft copy of the order which has been circulating among immigration lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft - which may yet be amended before it is signed by the president - is titled, &quot;Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals.&quot; It includes a 120-day ban on refugees being resettled in the US and an indefinite ban on the resettlement of Syrian refugees. It would also cap the total number of refugees entering the US in 2017 to 50,000 - more than half the previous year's figure of 117,000. The US has traditionally been the global leader in refugee resettlement and historically, the program has received bipartisan support and is an element of US foreign policy. The United Nations' refugee agency estimates that there are currently 4.81 million Syrian refugees in Syria's neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the draft, visas will be suspended to people from Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Iran for the next 30 days. The countries were selected from Division O, Title II, Section 203 of the 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was passed in the aftermath of San Bernardino and Paris Attacks and removed visa waivers for EU citizens who were dual nationals of the listed countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft order states that 60 days after it will be signed, the Department of Homeland Security and state department will issue a list of countries to be included in a more permanent ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump pledged in December 2015 to ban all muslims from entering the country. He later amended this promise, and instead called repeatedly for the &quot; extreme vetting &quot; of immigrants from certain countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ban itself is a Muslim ban,&quot; said Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC). &quot;If you take a look at the countries it's clearly a muslim ban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Trump signs order to begin Mexico border wall in immigration crackdown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to begin construction on his controversial wall on the US-Mexico border. The order also included a pledge to cut federal funding from so-called &quot;sanctuary cities&quot; a term which refers to cities where local law authorities do not cooperate with federal requests that could lead to deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York considers itself a sanctuary city, and local leaders, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, have repeatedly pledged to remain that way. New York City councilwoman Helen Rosenthal repeated that pledge on Wednesday: &quot;We are prepared to run this city without a single federal dollar,&quot; she said to loud cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in New York's Washington Square Park, people lit the park up with their cell phones and others held candles and speakers, standing under the famous arch chanting and cheering while helicopters swirled above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am here because I feel like I have a responsibility to give back to my community, give back to my Muslim brothers and sisters,&quot; high school senior Hebah Jamal said. &quot;To be able to be part of a movement against hate, against fear, and against discrimination.&quot;</SPAN></P>

More than a million of those are registered with the UN high commissioner for refugees in Lebanon, compared with a pre-war Lebanese population of four million, the per capita equivalent of the UK hosting 13 million refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in this tiny nation, with its 18 official religious sects, Syrians have endured many indignities - from onerous visa procedures to poor treatment and humiliation at the border and residency offices, to child labour, sexual exploitation, and life in fragile plastic tents that collapse in winter, and the xenophobia of local politicians pandering to fearful followers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, death brings a final indignity. Families of dead Syrians living in Lebanon are increasingly struggling to find a place to bury their loved ones, often leaving them for weeks or months in hospital morgues while they search for cemeteries that will take them. They struggle to scrape together enough money to pay off hospital fees, sometimes carrying them in cardboard boxes or in the backs of taxis and digging graves with their bare hands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs sometimes negotiate deals with municipalities to allow refugees to share cemeteries with the Lebanese, but they are growing overcrowded because of the large population of Syrians, often outnumbering locals by three or four times. Few landowners are willing to sell land to build graveyards, worried about plunging real estate prices and superstitions, and religious authorities are staying clear of the problem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Syrians, who are banned from work, cannot even afford the $200-$300 cost of burial, including performing Islamic rites of cleansing, or shrouds and gravestones, and donors are few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're not finally at ease when they are dead,&quot; said Haytham Taimey, a Lebanese sheikh who runs the Development and Renewal Association, an NGO that helps Syrians find and pay for burial spots. &quot;Even human emotions, when you've lost somebody close to you, their basic right of mourning and saying goodbye, Syrians don't have that any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no comprehensive data for mortality rates among Syrian refugees in Lebanon. UNHCR only finds out about deaths if a family opts to tell them, an unlikely step since it could mean a reduction in aid, or if a person who is receiving medical support dies in hospital. The organisation counted 2,087 deaths in 2015, though the number is likely much higher given the Syrian population and the limits on reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for UNHCR said they were aware of problems finding burial spots, and while the organisation cannot assist with burial procedures, it provides counselling to families and tries to put them in touch with NGOs that can help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UNHCR is aware of the general difficulties that Syrian refugees face in burying their loved ones in Lebanon,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;When UNHCR is alerted to specific issues, we ask our local partners to help refugees resolve this through dialogue. Local and religious authorities, local partners and municipalities are among the parties that could help refugees solve these issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, Arab cemeteries often included a section labeled &quot; madafen al-ghoraba &quot;, or the &quot;graveyards of the strangers&quot;, for visitors who passed away - a now defunct practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walid Luwais, an official at the Islamic endowments authority, acknowledged that the issue amounted to a crisis, but said that even when the government buys land for a cemetery plot neighbours often refuse to allow the burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't want graves near them, it's a popular superstition,&quot; said Taimey, the local sheikh. &quot;They love life and they don't want to open their windows and be reminded of the afterlife. They have to be hidden from view, though to be honest dead people are better neighbours, they never do anything to harm you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some municipalities have come up with solutions, allowing Syrians who live in refugee camps in their towns to bury their dead in a designated area of the cemetery, while turning away outsiders. One such town is Omariyah, which houses 15,000 Syrian refugees to 7,000 Lebanese, and where half of the local cemetery is occupied by dead Syrians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a real crisis,&quot; said Mohammad al-Ahmad, the town's mayor, who helped institute the rule. He said it was still painful to turn away desperate Syrians. &quot;Imagine someone coming to you who can't find a place to bury his dead loved one. When he asks you: 'So where do I go with my dead relative? In Syria I'm homeless, and here I can't even bury my relative.' You don't know what to do. Of course he should have a burial place,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Syrians in Lebanon, that heartbreak is a daily occurrence, and the calls to Taimey and local youth organisations are too frequent. One man, who declined to give his name, had to carry his father in the back of a pickup truck for hours until he managed to find a burial spot in a cemetery late at night, burying him without a coffin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting back tears, he walked away saying: &quot;They want us to just throw our dead in the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no shortage of stories of the desperate plight of Syrians. One volunteer with a youth group in Saadnayel, a town that hosts about 26,000 Syrians, described how they had to bury a 50-year-old man who had been in a morgue for 40 days. Hospitals will often keep custody of corpses if the victim has no paperwork or if his family owes money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a man who arrived in a taxi, and he had his son with him in a cardboard box,&quot; said Shuqayyif, the cemetery caretaker. &quot;A cardboard box. Not even a wooden casket. A cardboard box that probably had had potatoes or shoes in it. I saw that myself. And the father is there, digging with his hands to bury his child. It's heartbreaking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dramatic photos capture the moment that eight asylum seekers, including four children, barely made it across the Canadian  border on Friday as a US border patrol officer tried to stop them.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a US Customs and Border Patrol officer seized their passports and questioned a man in the front passenger seat of a taxi that had pulled up to the border in Champlain,  New York, four adults and four young children fled the cab and ran to Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one they scrambled across the snowy gully separating the two countries.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members dragged luggage and pushed their toddler in a stroller through the snow before Canadian officers detained them, per standard procedure for refugee claimants.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RCMP officers watching from the other side helped them up, lifting the younger children and asking a woman, who leaned on her fellow passenger as she walked, if she needed medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children looked back from where they had come as the US officer held the first man, saying his papers needed to be verified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man turned to a pile of belongings and heaved pieces of luggage two at a time into the gully - enormous wheeled suitcases, plastic shopping bags, a black backpack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Nobody cares about us,' he said. He said they were all from Sudan and had been living and working in Delaware for two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A photo showed that at least one of their passports was Sudanese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some media reports list the family as being from Somalia. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man then appeared to grab their passports from the US officer before making a run for the border.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer yelled and gave chase but stopped at the border marker. Canadian police took hold of the man's arm as he crossed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The border patrol officer told his counterpart that the man was in the United States illegally and that he would have detained him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers on both sides momentarily eyed the luggage strewn in the snow before the US officer took it, and a walker left on the road, to the border line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RCMP carried the articles to their vehicles, and the people piled in to be driven to a nearby border office to be interviewed by police and to make a refugee claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People seeking refugee status have been pouring over the Canada-US border as the United States looks to tighten its policies on refugees and undocumented immigrants.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The RCMP aren't there to treat them like bandits. They're here to apply the law',&nbsp;retired S&ucirc;ret&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec police officer and Hemmingford resident Fran&ccedil;ois Dor&eacute; told&nbsp; CBCNews.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The small town of Hemmingford has seen a surge of asylum seekers since President Donald Trump took office and instated a ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Sudan and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though key parts of the ban have been blocked by a federal judge, there is still confusion.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum seekers from around the world have shown up here cold and hungry from difficult border crossings in the dead of winter.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Sometimes when you're left with no options and you're looking for a better life for yourself, people do take risks', Mohamud Noor, executive director of the Confederation of Somali Community in Minnesota told Global News.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It will increase rather than decrease ... This is not going to reduce'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian government does not have statistics on the number of people seeking refugee status who enter the country illegally.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sergeant Harold Pfleiderer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told The New York Times that 'there has been an increase in illegal migration in Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia, with the largest increase being seen in Quebec'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason they are crossing into Canada is because the country is part of an agreement that bars refugees that have already arrived in another 'safe' country from trying to trade up to another country.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum-seekers sneak across because even if they are caught, they can make a claim in Canada; if they make a claim at a border crossing, they are turned away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has admitted that he is 'very concerned' with the amount of asylum seekers crossing into rural areas.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Trudeau did not say whether he would seek to suspend Canada's agreement with the US and allow these people to apply for refugee status at official borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of these crossings have been happening on the New York-Quebec border, which authorities attribute to its closeness to the major East Coast cities.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials were on Nauru doing 'extreme vetting' on detainees for a week before the heated phone call between Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff from the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department's Resettlement Support Centre arrived January 22 and began interviews the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second team to visit the small Pacific island since the agreement to send 1,250 refugees to the U.S. was announced in November, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told The Australian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before they arrived, 1,555 of the 2,077 asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island were ruled to be genuine refugees after&nbsp;ASIO, Immigration and health checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest were not deemed refugees and will presumably be denied entry to both Australia and the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detainees represented 21 countries and most of the refugees are from Iran plus some from Iraq, both countries listed on President Trump's immigration ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His executive order included a last-minute clause exempting pre-existing agreements after lobbying by Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, which ended a bloody 26-year ethnic civil war in 2009, were the next two most common nationalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Dutton said though vetting was progressing, getting refugees out of the camps was a 'difficult juggling act' and it would take time to relocate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are keen to get people off there as quickly as possible... we've got unfinished business. There's a long way to go before we can get people off,'&nbsp;he told 2GB radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was convinced Mr Trump would honour the deal, despite calling it 'dumb' and the 'worst deal ever' in public and private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I take the president at his word. He has given a commitment to our prime minister,' he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump and Prime Minister Turnbull clashed over the deal in their first telephone call on Sunday, described as the president's worst call of the day 'by far'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He complained he was 'going to get killed' politically and said Australia was trying to ship the U.S the 'next Boston bombers'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump later abruptly ended the call, which was supposed to last an hour, after just 25 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours before the explosive report of the conversation broke on Thursday, he again vented his frustration with the deal on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!' he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also reportedly fumed about the agreement to advisers soon after signing the executive order, saying 'I don't want these people'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian and U.S. leaders have spent the days since the call was made public trying to solidify the deal and patch up frayed relations between the staunch allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Turnbull said he wanted to keep the conversation private and described the call as 'frank' and 'forthright' but claimed it 'ended courteously'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump admitted the call was 'tough' and he repeatedly grilled his opposite number on why the deal was struck and the U.S. had to take Australian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I love Australia as a country, but we had a problem,' Trump said, explaining how President Obama agreed to resettle '1,000 illegal immigrants who were in prisons.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said he was 'unbelievably disappointed' and 'extremely, extremely upset' by the deal, but slammed reports of the heated phone call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Thank you to the Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about,' Trump wrote in an early-morning tweet. 'Very nice.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of U.S. and Australian politicians and experts have since weighed in to say while the report was embarrassing, the exchange wouldn't harm relations long term.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Scottish university vet told of her heartbreak at being one of the first people banned from entering the US under Donald Trump's shameful immigration crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamaseh Tayari, who works at Glasgow University, said she could not stop crying over her ordeal as the ban on refugees entering America TURN TO PAGE 2 &brvbar; From Page One sparked worldwide chaos. Airlines have been forced to turn away passengers from seven Muslim countries affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamaseh, who has an Iranian passport, was due to fly home to Glasgow after a week-long holiday in Costa Rica with her boyfriend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she was refused permission to board her flight because it went via New York and she would need a transit visa, which was revoked under Trump's executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;This has shocked me. We just discovered [what Trump did] at the airport when we went to check in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want people to know this isn't just happening to refugees. I am a graduate and have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and pays tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamaseh, who grew up in Italy, joined Glasgow University as a resident in veterinary anaesthesia in November 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and her boyfriend were trying to find another route home yesterday. A flight to Madrid tomorrow will cost them &pound;2000 and they still have to find a way from there to Glasgow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;It will cost me a month's salary just to get home. I am destroyed. I did not know I could cry for so long. It feels like the beginning of the end. I'm really afraid about what's going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posters on Facebook were last night suggesting a crowdfunding scheme to get Hamaseh back to Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order bans all refugees for four months. It also bans anyone from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen entering the US for 90 days and indefinitely halts anyone from Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump says the ban is needed to keep out &quot;radical Islamic terrorists&quot;. His order suspended a programme that last year resettled about 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In retaliation, Iran has said it will stop US citizens entering the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Iraqi refugees were detained in New York. Their flight was en route to JFK Airport when the ban was introduced. Haneed Khalid Darweesh, who had trade president worked as a US Army interpreter, was released yesterday afternoon. The other man, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, remains in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oscar nominee and Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi will not be able to attend the Academy Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internet giant Google are recalling staff working overseas to the US and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has also condemned Trump's order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Civil Liberties Union have filed a suit challenging the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Theresa May refused three times yesterday to criticise Trump's immigration ban. The PM, on a visit to Turkey, was left severely embarrassed in front of the country's prime minister Binali Yildirim, who condemned it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being questioned on the issue at a joint press conference in Ankara, May said: &quot;The US is responsible for US policy on refugees. The UK is responsible for UK policy on refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey, a Muslim country, is host to almost three million Syrian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yildirim said: &quot;This refugee issue is a global issue. We cannot turn a blind eye and you cannot solve this by building walls.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated in the best foreign&nbsp;film category for his movie The Salesman but there are fears he may now not be able to attend next month's Academy Awards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His native Iran, which is where The Salesman was filmed, is one of seven countries listed in Trump's executive order that has placed a 90-day pause on visas and immigration to the U.S.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout from Trump's immigration crackdown grew on Saturday as a number of non-American citizens realized they were now barred from the country where they were studying or had lived, perhaps for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as seven refugees bound for the U.S. were stopped from boarding a plane in Cairo on Saturday and 12 migrants were detained in New York overnight because they arrived just after the executive order was signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, tweeted on Saturday morning that&nbsp;Farhadi would be banned from attending the Oscars in what has become yet another fallout from Trump's immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Iran's Asghar Farhadi won't be let into the US to attend Oscar's. He's nominated for best foreign language film... #MuslimBan,' he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panic broke out after Department of Homeland Security issued a directive at 4.30pm on Friday enforcing Trump's executive order to close down the borders to refugees and visa holders from a list of banned Muslim-majority countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Iran, the other countries on Trump's blacklist are Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian-born actress who stars in Farhadi's The Salesman vowed to boycott the Oscars over Trump's immigration bans.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taraneh Alidoosti, the 33-year-old known as the Natalie Portman of Iran,&nbsp;took to Twitter&nbsp;with a message for fans on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest,' she tweeted.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visa ban sparked fear for some refugees who were already on their way to the U.S. when the order came into effect and were detained on arrival.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqi refugees who was detained for 14 hours at New York, was released on Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 53-year-old had arrived in America on a flight from Istanbul on Friday night, just hours after Trump implemented the immigration ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He&nbsp;had worked for the U.S. government in Iraq for 10 years as a translator, engineer and contractor and had a valid special immigration visa to relocate to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darweesh pumped his fist in the air outside the airport following his release, as a crowd of supporters cheered him on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'First of all I want to thank the people that take care of me and support me. This is the humility, this is the soul of America,' he told a crowd gathered outside the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is what pushed me to move - leave my country and come here. America is the land of freedom... America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what he thought of Trump he said: 'I don't know. He's a president, I'm a normal person.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was travelling with his wife and three children at the time but they were not detained. They were heading to Charlotte, North Carolina to start their new life in America.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Darweesh and another Iraqi Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who is still detained at JFK, filed a lawsuit on Saturday morning in a bid to have them released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men were on separate flights when immigration officials stopped them on Friday night and took their passports when they landed in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alshawi - who was approved for a visa on January 11 - was flying to America to join his wife and son in Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHO EXACTLY IS BANNED FROM THE U.S?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That covers legal permanent residents - green card holders - and visa-holders from those seven countries who were out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban.&nbsp;They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customs and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas have been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S. Airlines are being told to keep them off those flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Source: Associated Press&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven other refugees are still being held at JFK airport. Protesters gathered outside the airport on Saturday in anger over those being held in detention.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cairo airport officials said seven U.S.-bound migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's JFK airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane on Saturday after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action at Cairo airport was the first there since Trump imposed the three-month ban on refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutch airline KLM says it had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world - that these people are no longer welcome,' Manel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the seven, who were from the seven blacklisted countries, were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear how many refugees or visa holders are already being detained across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee said there was chaos at airports and in the air following Trump's ban with the organization already receiving calls for help from green card and other visa holders after being refused admission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Visas being denied immediately. Chaos at airports and in the air. #MuslimBan will apply to green card holders attempting to return tonight,' the ADC's Abed Ayoub tweeted on Friday night.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's ban puts a 90-day pause on visas and immigration from seven countries including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also puts a 120-day ban on all refugee entries into the country and declares that refugees from Syria are not welcome until further notice.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ANTI-IMMIGRATION ORDER DO?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban refugee entries from all countries for 120 days. Refugees can be accepted on case-by-case basis, including&nbsp;if they are a religious minority facing religious persecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Block refugee entries from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap refugee intake at 50,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban visa and immigration entries for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries on banned list, including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspend visa issuance to countries of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that period of time, refugees will be accepted only from countries that the State and Homeland Security Departments decide are safe to work with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as Iran's foreign ministry suggested the country would limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for Trump's suspension of immigration and visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official IRNA news agency carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry on Saturday that said Iran will resort to 'counteraction' to Trump's executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals,' the statement read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google urged its staff travelling overseas on Friday to immediately return to the U.S. if they would be affected by the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEO Sundar Pichai issued a memo slamming Trump's order saying 100 employees were affected, Bloomberg  reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech company feared its employees, even though they have valid visas, would be stopped from returning to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg hit out at Trump condemning his anti-immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that,' Zuckerberg said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows reports that Muslim-majority countries with ties to Trump's business empire have been excluded from the order,&nbsp; Bloomberg  reports.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics show Trump doesn't have any business relations with the seven black-listed countries, but does with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order&nbsp;declares that U.S. policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also&nbsp;gives Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year, according to the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order declares that the U.S. will 'prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution.'&nbsp;But that only applies when 'the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY BARBARA DAVIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To those who crossed his path in the Calais Jungle, he cut a sympathetic figure as a young Syrian refugee hoping to cross the Channel to start a new life free from fear and persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his easy charm and near-perfect English, Mohamed Bajjar bridged the yawning gap between the refugees and the British volunteers trying to help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before long, the 27-year-old had become a leading light within one charity, Care4Calais, and a near-constant presence at the side of its married fIounder, Clare Moseley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their relationship, it was reported this week, became romantic and he and 46-year-old former accountant Mrs Moseley embarked on a year-long affair while he worked as her translator and bodyguard.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liaison, which is said to have ended acrimoniously this month with Mrs Moseley accusing Bajjar known as Kimo' of trying to con her out of thousands of pounds, has embroiled the charity in a highly damaging scandal, not least because of its strict no sex with refugees' policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even that egregious episode appears to be merely the tip of the iceberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Mail can reveal that not only is Bajjar not a Syrian refugee, but he was married to another British woman at the time of his affair with Mrs Moseley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually a Tunisian market-stall trader, Bajjar embarked on an epic journey from his homeland to France's northern coast taking in detours to Italy, where he visited his sister, Germany, where he claimed asylum-seeker's allowance, and Poland, where he worked in a factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His odyssey sheds a disturbing light on the ease with which economic migrants wanting to reach the UK can pose as refugees to cross borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bajjar's long-suffering British wife Carol Hutchings, who bears a startling resemblance to Clare Moseley, told me this week that she warned both Care4Calais and Mrs Moseley more than a year ago that her cheating husband was tricking them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was ignored,' she says. I messaged Clare Moseley online and I could see she'd read my message but I got no reply. Volunteers I contacted on Facebook blocked me. No one wanted to know.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Calais, where volunteers are still working to help those left behind since the Jungle was bulldozed last October, Mrs Moseley has provoked outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sex between a refugee and a volunteer is not OK no matter how old they are,' says one woman who used to work with Mrs Moseley. The refugees have been to hell and back and are reliant on volunteers for food and warmth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To sleep with someone 19 years her junior in that situation utterly disgusts me.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But of course, Bajjar was no real refugee. His middle-class family owns a souk in Sousse, the Tunisian resort near where a terrorist gunman shot dead 30 British tourists in 2015. His parents are currently building a large multi-storey property in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his wife Carol, a 54-year-old mother of two from Manchester: He's very ambitious and is happy to use women to get what he wants. Foolishly, I only realised that after I married him.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol first met Bajjar in a nightclub in Sousse while she was on holiday in 2009. I wasn't looking for a relationship,' she says, but he was charming. I thought he was in love with me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lied about his age and said he was ten years older than he was. Looking back, it was all a con but I was taken in.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol and Bajjar stayed in touch via Skype and phone calls and he proposed to her six months later. She visited him twice a year, met his mother and twin sister, and they married in March 2014 in a ceremony in French, English and Arabic at his family home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol, who returned to Manchester soon afterwards, considered moving to Tunisia but after the wedding, she says, Bajjar became more demanding and frequently asked her for money. He said it was for a visa to come over,' she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the beginning I'd have moved heaven and earth to get him here, but I told him he needed to sort it out himself. I wasn't sure any more that I even wanted him to come to England.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bajjar left Tunisia in September 2014. According to Carol, his parents gave him 3,000 euros (about &pound;2,600) to travel in a fishing boat from Tunis to Palermo in Sicily, where he stayed with his sister for four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He phoned me out of the blue and said: &quot;I got out of Tunisia and I did it without you.&quot; '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he next called in January 2015, he was in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed asylum there by saying he was Syrian,' she says, But he had a job at a Coca-Cola factory in Poland and he flitted&nbsp;back to Germany each month so he could get his asylum-seeker's allowance.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol says Bajjar left Hamburg in Germany in July 2015, bound for Calais, after the German authorities found out he was Tunisian (everyone over 16 in Tunisia is fingerprinted, and they were able to match his prints).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He arrived in Calais just days after David Cameron was condemned for describing migrants as a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean, seeking a better life, wanting to come to Britain'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bajjar even spoke to a Channel 5 news team about his determination to get to the UK. I'm not giving up,' he said. Every day I'm trying and keep trying, keep trying, until I get through.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Bajjar was hanging out with refugees trying to make their way through the Channel Tunnel, back in the UK, Clare Moseley was taking an increasing interest in the plight of Calais refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daughter of Merseyside folk singer Bob Buckle, she is a former accountant who once worked for large firms including Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte while regularly carrying out charity work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was a long-serving Prince's Trust volunteer, providing free advice to start-up businesses on book-keeping and tax issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend claimed this week that Mrs Moseley's left-wing instincts' were at odds with the corporate environment in which she worked, and that she longed to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Mrs Moseley's own account, the moment she decided to swap her cosy life in the Merseyside suburb of Heswall for the Calais camp came when she was sitting in bed in the palatial &pound;700,000 five-bedroom home she shares with her husband Ben, 38, a corporate tax specialist, reading an article about the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men, women and children were risking their lives to get to Western Europe and many were dying in the process,' she later recalled, adding: My husband came upstairs to find me crying. I felt helpless and angry.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within days she had filled her car with clothing and set off for the Calais camp where Bajjar had recently installed himself. She volunteered with the French charity L'Auberge des Migrants but within weeks declared that she wanted to run her own charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launch of Care4Calais in November 2015 was not popular with everyone. Some volunteers in Calais accused Mrs Moseley of wanting her own ego vehicle', rather than working alongside existing charities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was criticised for doubling the cost of aid reaching refugees by creating a need for two warehouses. And community representatives in the camp released a letter criticising the leaders of Care4Calais' for not trusting the refugees to distribute aid among themselves, as other charities did, but expecting them to queue to receive donated items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one stage they even asked the charity to withdraw from the Jungle unless they are prepared to comply with the wishes of the community and code of conduct which has been worked out over many months between the volunteer organisations and the refugees'. Since the Jungle was demolished, the charity's work has become more targeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while Mrs Moseley became a dynamic media figure named as one of six women who made 2015' by the Guardian controversy was never far away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 2016, after a series of attacks by migrants on lorry drivers, she sparked outrage by stating that it was not the end of the world' if the drivers were forced to find other jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Care4Calais later apologised for the comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was again forced to make an apology last October for likening the treatment of asylum-seekers by French authorities to the plight of Jews under the Nazis. She said her emotions were running wild', adding: I did not mean in any way to trivialise what happened with the Jews.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Moseley was also vocal last September when it emerged that several women volunteers had embarked on relationships within the camp and a row broke out over whether those involved were sexually exploiting' the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, called for charities in Calais to impose zero tolerance' policies on any exploitation to maintain their work's integrity'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, indeed, Care4Calais had already introduced its own zero tolerance' policy regarding relationships with refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Moseley said such activity will not be condoned on the basis of recognising the fundamental vulnerability of residents in refugee camps and the possibility of exploitative behaviour'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, given her relationship with Bajjar, she now faces accusations of hypocrisy. As one contributor to an online discussion put it: This woman is an egotist who has brought bad press to the migrant crisis many times.' It is not known when she began her relationship with Bajjar, who gave himself the more Syrian-sounding name Kimo'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photograph given to the Mail this week, of them sitting side by side in the camp (above left), was posted by Mrs Moseley in November 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Hutchings says she became aware that her husband was seeing someone else soon after he arrived in Calais. She saw photographs of him on Facebook, socialising with Care4Calais volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It became harder to reach him on the phone, she says, and he grew increasingly evasive. Once, when &nbsp;she called his phone, a woman she believes was Mrs Moseley answered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was obvious he wasn't bothered about coming to England any more,' she says. Why would he, when he had such a good thing going in Calais? He always seemed to have &nbsp;money until last week, when he contacted me asking for help.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to former volunteers, the affair was common knowledge around the camp, with some refugees believing that Bajjar and Mrs Moseley were husband and wife. They were said to have moved into a shared Calais flat, while Mrs Moseley's trips home to her husband became more sporadic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One volunteer said: It is deeply hypocritical that the woman who runs the charity had this relationship. Towards the end of it, everyone in the camp knew.' Writing online, another of Mrs Moseley's former co-workers wrote: Clare is an egotist with a clear lack of professional boundaries. She makes all migrants and all volunteers look like sex-crazed lunatics.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Moseley's ill-fated relationship with Bajjar is now believed to be over. She is said to have become concerned when he asked her for money to send to his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was arrested on January 6 on suspicion of stealing her mobile phone but released without charge, and is now living above a clothes shop in Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite everything, Mrs Moseley appears determined to carry on at the helm of Care4Calais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has refused to answer the Mail's questions about her affair or reveal if Bajjar was paid by Care4Calais. A statement by the charity said: Our priority remains to support and protect refugees.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While three months have passed since the Jungle was razed, migrants still arrive in the area every day, setting up smaller camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Care4Calais is now advertising for a &pound;40,000-a-year operations manager to work with Mrs Moseley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With temperatures falling below zero in recent weeks, Mrs Moseley has appealed for blankets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us stitch ourselves together, young and old, black and white, rich and poor, like a blanket created by the love of strangers who offer shelter to those who need it,' she wrote on the Care4Calais website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some might argue of course that the chill in the Calais air is in danger of being forgotten amid the storm of controversy raging around her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Vanessa Redgrave Q&amp;A: 'I won't direct again'</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">797  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legendary actress tells us about her directorial debut, refugee documentary Sea Sorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vanessa Redgrave, 80, first came to Cannes in 1966 when she won Best Actress for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Morgan - A Suitable Case for Treatment</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. 51 years later she returns with her directorial debut, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Sea Sorrow</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a very personal documentary about the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her son Carlo Nero (whose credits include </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Fever</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Eyes of St John</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) produces. Key contributors to the film include interviewee Lord Alf Dubs, as well as Ralph Fiennes and Emma Thompson.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film screens Thursday (May 18) as a Special Screening in Official Selection and is sold by Autlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Had you thought about directing a film for a while?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No I hadn't at all, absolutely not. It's the subject matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Why is the story of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">refugees</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> so important to you, did that start when you were young?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Very definitely it started in my childhood [during World War 2]. Like many children, I was an evacuee as we were called in those days. There wasn't any human rights legislation regarding refugees. I think it's unforgettable when you get separated from your parents. We went to live with a relative so we were lucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were thousands of London children who were evacuated and didn't stay with relatives. One story I will never forget - I had learned to read very, very early, and when I was about four our nanny had a newspaper, and there was a terrifying story of two evacuated children that had been starved and beaten by a farmer. One of them died, they had been stealing turnips from his field because they were so hungry. I shiver thinking about it now. That cruelty goes on today with refugees. That's what happening</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">What was it like for you to visit the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">refugee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> camps?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's horrifying to see. That shouldn't have happened to refugees, but it did. I've been in Kosovo, I've been where Palestinians have been refugees, I've been in the freezing cold where people are surviving in UN programmes It makes you all the more determined to get them the help that you know could and should be getting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">How did you decide to tell such a massive global story in a personal way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't remember the exact moment. It's very much thanks to Carlo [Nero, her son and producer] that it's told that way, it's instinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Why was Lord Dubs such a compelling figure to follow, is he someone you already knew?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hadn't known him. It was a wonderful blessing to meet him. Alf Dubs is proof of what can happen. To him it would be impossible not to do what he's doing, to spend morning, noon and night to think of how he can help refugees. It makes a huge, huge difference. The more we heard about Alf and his story, I knew we had to have him in the film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">What do you want your audience to take away from the film?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, I like the film to enter inside them. Because it's their own history that they don't know, most people don't know the history, or have forgotten it. We all need reminding continually I think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time I hope that the film will make people feel that they could do something, The feeling of, &quot;I can't carry on with my life and not do something.&quot; That's what I hope will happen. For that to happen things have to sink in gently and deeply to really grip people. The news channels are full of quick impressions, people are bombarded with every kind of problem. &nbsp;So it's hard to think what they can do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Did you learn anything new in researching the film or this was all history you knew?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know this history so well, it's an obsession for me and has been for a long, long time. I was always reading up, finding books that were out of print.&nbsp; I've studied pretty well every account that's every been written of the concentrations camps and the individual experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">You have a long history with Cannes, why are you excited to premiere your film here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My very first award was in Cannes, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Morgan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the first film I made. So it's a special connection for me. Last year I was there with Howards End in Cannes Classics. With respect to many other film festivals like Toronto or London, Cannes is a very special place. I'm awfully glad that Carlo and Alf Dubs and our little film company will be there with our film </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Sea Sorrow</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Do you think you will direct again?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't for a minute! I'm 80 and had a heart attack two years ago, I don't think I've got much time left. I will spend the time I have helping this film be seen. We will work on how we can show it in schools as well, I think young people need to see it. There's not been a proper education on the Holocaust. &nbsp;Part of the horror of the Holocaust was that no European country opened its doors wide to the Holocaust refugees. We need to be steady and choose love and be very firm and stand up to the wrong and not let fascists win. That's all that's required really.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1098 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent snowy Saturday, Jim Estill went knocking on his neighbours' doors, offering to shovel snow from walkways and driveways for cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind him stood a handful of Syrian refugees, newly arrived to the Canadian city of Guelph, in south-western Ontario. Estill, the CEO of multimillion-dollar appliance company Danby, was acting as the group's salesman, and helped the refugees land 50 snow-clearing jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a glimpse into the deep relationship that has been forged since the mild-mannered executive decided just over a year ago to spend C$1.5m (&pound;904,000) to bring 200 Syrian refugees to Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the summer of 2015, moved by the headlines emerging from what he called one of the &quot;the greatest humanitarian crises of our lifetime&quot;, Estill began working out how many families he could help under Canada's private sponsorship programme, which was launched 35 years ago after the Vietnam war and has brought more than 275,000 refugees to Canada. It allows private citizens to welcome and settle refugees as long as they commit to covering the expenses for the first year or so and helping the newcomers ease into their new lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 59-year-old estimated that it would cost C$30,000 to support a family of five in Guelph, a small city some 60 miles (96km) west of Toronto, and that he could support about 50 families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't think that was a big deal,&quot; Estill said in an interview with the Guardian. &quot;Guelph is 120,000 in population, and 50 families is maybe 250 or 300 people. That's a blip, that's nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called a meeting with several of the city's religious and aid organisations in September, all of whom signed up to his ambitious plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the easy bit. What followed, Estill said, was the worst part: how to choose who would come to Canada, amid the millions who have been displaced. &quot;Basically you're playing God,&quot; he said. &quot;You're choosing who lives and who dies and who comes and who doesn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estill decided that his scheme's success could be measured by refugees eventually working, paying taxes and having some degree of integration into Canadian society. With that goal in mind, he favoured those who had relatives in the area, as well as families. &quot;The part that was bad is that we wouldn't take a single mother with eight kids, because we thought, 'Your life is not going to be that good and how are you going to settle successfully?' So that's the way we chose,&quot; he said. &quot;It's terrible, but what can you do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He selected 58 families, but wants to continue to bring in refugees in waves of 50 families at a time, ensuring each wave is settled before launching into the paperwork to bring in the next group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far 47 families have arrived in Guelph, with another 11 expected in the coming months. Helping the newcomers - who will eventually number about 225 in total - adjust to their new lives has become a city-wide effort, with more than 800 residents volunteering to help navigate challenges that range from finding rental housing in a city where the vacancy rate hovers around 0.6%, to introducing the newcomers to the frigid, snowy Canadian winters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is a full-scale operation - staffed by volunteers and bolstered by a deluge of donations - that offers the refugees everything from job training to English-language classes. Each family is paired with Arabic- and English-speaking mentors, who aid them in tasks that range from riding the city bus to setting up a bank account. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been quite amazing,&quot; said Sara Sayyed, who along with her husband, Muhammed Sayyed, of the Muslim Society of Guelph, have helped Estill oversee the settlement of the families. &quot;Everybody has gotten involved, from the municipal government to all the different organisations that are out there. We've got people from all walks of life, volunteering everything from their time to their services to donating things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estill, however, has been the backbone of the effort. He and his wife have billeted a steady stream of newly arrived families in their home, and he often spends evenings visiting the homes of newcomers. New rental housing has been financed and an office building converted into residences as he works to increase the city's supply of rental homes. At Danby, he established a programme that offers the refugees three months of work experience to get them on their feet, allowing them a flexible schedule to accommodate job interviews and the twice-weekly in-house English-language classes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one downtown shopping centre, renovations are under way for a two-storey establishment that will host a dollar store, backed by Estill and run by a 31-year-old former car salesman from Damascus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I still don't believe it,&quot; said the refugee, who asked to be identified as Youssef in order to protect his family in Syria. After he expressed an interest in running the store, Estill opened a line of credit for him and told him he could own the small business. &quot;He brought me here to this country and he didn't just stop there.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youssef fled Syria when the war began, ending up in Cairo. He had been trying to work up the courage to smuggle himself into Europe, but fear always held him back. After hearing about Estill's project from a cousin in Canada, he filled out the applications, knowing it was a longshot but wondering whether Canada might hold the destiny that he had failed to reach in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was shocked to find out he had been chosen. &quot;I immediately Googled his name. I mean, who is this person who is going to pay $1.5m to sponsor strangers that he has never met?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he arrived in Canada in July, he made a point of seeking out Estill. &quot;I thanked him for his generosity - I told him that no one has been as generous to me as Jim Estill, besides my parents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deep gratitude colours Youssef's description of Estill. &quot;He drives a small car, he is extremely humble,&quot; said Youssef, pointing to Estill's Toyota Prius. &quot;If I were a millionaire like Jim, I would never, ever drive his car. All of this money he has, he only cares about humanitarian efforts.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Estill, the payback on his investment has been in watching the families settle into life in Canada. &quot;There's nothing more satisfying than seeing that,&quot; he said. More than half of the families who have arrived so far have found jobs and are paying their own rent, taking delight in purchases such as their first television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is quick to brush aside any praise for what he has done. &quot;I still don't see what the big deal is. And I'm surprised more people don't step up and do it,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't want to grow old and say I stood by and did nothing. So I decided to do my small part.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three detainees and some Australian officers have been injured by rocks thrown at Manus Island detention centre when about 100 gunshots were fired on Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight between locals and the&nbsp;Papua New Guinea Navy and detainees is understood to have begun on the soccer field - before locals and asylum seekers began throwing rocks at each other over the fence of the compound.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition Centre claims military officers stationed at the Lombrum Naval Base, next to the detention centre, began shooting into the complex between 6.30pm and 7pm.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Images show bullet holes through walls and poles of the detention centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Sudanese man is reported to have sustained a head injury and a Pakistani man detained on Manus has a stomach injury, causing him to urinate blood, says Behrouz Boochani - a journalist detained on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reports another Sudanese man has a chest injury, and some Australian officers have been injured and did not attend the centre for work on Saturday. Mr Boochani claims none of these injuries were caused by guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'All of these injuries were caused by stones thrown by local people and not because of gun shots,' he wrote to followers of his Facebook page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been reported from advocates and men on Manus Island that detainees hid in their rooms, some under their beds, for most of the shooting. But Mr Behrouz said the fear had also hit Australian staff at the compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'On the other side of the fences, in staff accommodation, the Australian non-security staff like case managers, interpreters, and immigration were scared too,' he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I talked with some of them and they were in an unsafe place like the refugees. Some of those staff did not come to work today.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Last night proved that Australia cannot ensure safety not only for refugees but for its citizens too.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security workers and some Australian staff are understood to have fled the compound, and boarded a ship when the fight began to get out of control on Friday evening.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night's events have lead to calls to have asylum seekers and refugees evacuated from the compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian Churches Refugee Taskforce, representing several Christian church leaders, issued a statement on Saturday calling on the government to 'act with compassion' and evacuate the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For the latest outbreak of violence to occur on Good Friday, an important part of the Christian calendar, there can be no ignoring the synergy of suffering,' Very Reverend Peter Catt said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The darkness of betrayal and abandonment that we are familiar with in the Jesus story is being felt keenly by those on Manus Island this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'By bringing people to Australia, the US (refugee) deal may continue. More importantly, the healing of those who have been damaged by our nation's policy can begin.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar calls have also been issued by Amnesty Australia and The Human Rights Law Centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unconfirmed reports suggest a fight broke out between asylum seekers and military officers on the soccer field. When the refugees returned to the compound, their opponents followed to continue the argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Papua New Guinea Defence Force claimed to the ABC  one of its officers was 'assaulted by asylum seekers playing soccer' on the night - though a man living on Manus Island claims the local men and Navy personnel were drunk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is reported the soccer field has been a constant source of tension since the detention centre was declared closed, and the compound became part of the naval base. &nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rintoul says the attackers were originally armed with rocks and knives, but were not able to gain entry to the compound and used guns instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is believed the shooting has stopped for now, Mr Rintoul says those living in the compound are frightened escalating tensions could lead to another incident similar to that which resulted in the death of asylum seeker Reza Berati in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'People are extremely frightened, because this raises the spectre of the kind of attack in 2014 that resulted in the death of Reza Berrati,' Ian Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition told Daily Mail Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It reveals how vulnerable people on Manus are and how tenuous the situation is - even after three and a half years it's an extremely volatile situation.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who has been on Manus Island since 2013 told Daily Mail Australia the fight originated when some drunk Navy officers tried to kick the detainees off the soccer field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it soon turned into a fight with more locals getting involved, and a Sudanese asylum seeker was beaten up. As other detainees realised the man was being hit, they ran in to help him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When locals began throwing stones, the asylum seekers escaped back to the camp. Locals began throwing stones over the fence, and the asylum seekers threw them back, the man said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Navy car driving past stopped so its passengers could talk with people throwing stones, he claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They sped off and soon came back with more people, who were armed with 'guns, machetes and sticks', he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detainee, who wished not to be named, said Wilson Security guards were also under attack during the incident, but when they escaped the Navy officers blocked the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'[PNG Navy personnel] tried to break the lock of Oscar camp on the main gate,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It was so scary. Some people were so scared and shocked, and some were crying as the locals started shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But before this happened, they had evacuated all of the staff in the camp, so it was only us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That's much scarier - when you see they are all escaping and leaving you behind and at the same time you know you're being attacked.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man said officers were shooting for more than 20 minutes, and at times were aiming directly at the fence of the compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If they saw anyone outside, they would aim at them,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was present during the 2014 riot which saw 23-year-old Iranian asylum seeker Reza Berati killed, and had flashbacks of being beaten as he hid from the gunshots under a bed on Friday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Those memories were coming to me again and reviving,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This time I knew they didn't care if you had done anything wrong or not, they would just beat you, because last time they wouldn't care for anyone, they would beat everybody.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said guards have not been able to guarantee the shooting is over for the night, and have advised detainees to stay away from the fences.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There is nothing we can do,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are locked in a camp with nowhere to go and nothing to do. Some of the people in here have tried to make weapons for themselves in case of an attack, some of my friends are sleeping with their shoes on and many others can't sleep.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An advocate in close contact with some of the men on Manus says she had been told tension between the locals and asylum seekers had been escalating 'for weeks'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Tension has been building in the camp a lot over the last few weeks,' she told Daily Mail Australia. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I was told on more than one occasion by the men that they felt 'something was going to happen'.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photographs shared by the Refugee Action Coalition show bullet holes in fencing around the rooms, as well as in walls and poles in the compound.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video also shared by the RAC showed a car pull away from the compound as multiple shots are fired. An Australian man is heard shouting in the background, though it is not clear what he is saying. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rintoul claims almost 999 refugees and asylum seekers remain on the island in 'dangerous' conditions, and says this will not be fixed by a deal struck by the Australian Government for the United States to take some of the men.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Even if the US deal goes ahead, hundreds of people are going to be left behind on Manus and Nauru,' he said in a statement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Malcolm Turnbull cannot pretend the US deal offers any solution for those people illegally held on Manus Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Sooner or later, the people taken to Manus will have to be taken back to Australia. PNG has no ability of intention to resettle any refugees or asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Good Friday incident is one more reason why Malcolm Turnbull should act immediately to close Manus and Nauru and bring bring all the refugees to Australia.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manus Island MP Ron Knight claims the incident began when a defence officer was 'assaulted by refugees'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says soldiers retaliated, but were outnumbered, causing a 'riot'. He further claimed the gunshots were 'warning shots' to say police were attending.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Yes people warning shots. If they were shooting at them they would be dead,' he said on Twitter.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Boochani claimed PNG defence personnel broke into some of the rooms on Friday, and described the situation as critical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tweeted about the situation, saying there have been no injuries, and reported Australian security officers still in the compound were also 'extremely scared'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 10.30pm, Mr Behrouz reported through his Twitter account that the Australian staff had recently also evacuated the centre at the direction of their bosses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote: 'The officers closed the gates and left the centre. We are alone, nobody here to protect refugees'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The refugees are scared of another attack on the centre. The Australian officers did not tell us, why did they leave the centre?'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kon Karapanagiotidis of the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre said the incident showed why asylum seekers on Manus Island should be brought to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The latest crisis on Manus shows how dangerous, unstable and untenable leaving refugees on Manus is,' he told Daily Mail Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Turnbull Government continues to be tone deaf to the fact that the majority of Australians want these men evacuated immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have a duty of care to protect them, they are refugees and our responsibility. There is an immediate solution available which is to evacuate these men to safety immediately and bring them here.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Immigration and Border Protection confirmed there was an incident at Manus Regional Processing Centre involving residents and PNG military personnel.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the Department says PNG authorities are investigating the matter and residents are now safely inside the centre.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There are reports one resident was injured from a rock thrown during the incident and he is receiving treatment,' they said, noting the Department was continuing to monitor the situation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department also confirmed PNG military personnel discharged a weapon into the air during the incident but says nobody was injured.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack on a teenage asylum seeker last Friday in Croydon comes as reports of abuse directed at refugee children are becoming more frequent, charities and experts have warned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Reker Ahmed, the 17-year-old Kurdish Iranian who was attacked, recovered in hospital on Monday, those involved in supporting asylum-seeking children expressed dismay at the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Toxic political agenda is dehumanising entire groups, Amnesty warns</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy Elvin, CEO of the fostering organisation Tact, which has looked after hundreds of asylum-seeking children across the country, said he was aware of a number of children in his organisation's care who had been verbally abused in the streets, and he believed this was a growing problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is verbal abuse - about their status, what they are doing in this country, why they don't go back,&quot; he said. The organisation runs support groups, advising newly-arrived asylum seeking children on how to respond to negative experiences. It was particularly an issue which young people encountered on public transport, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have made several reports to the police of hate crimes. We think it is rising. It is entirely linked to the environment that has been created by the public discourse about people coming to this country from overseas... Asylum seekers are all seen as bogus - not as children, not traumatised, not in need, just freeloaders coming here to take advantage of the system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usually the abuse came as a complete surprise to the young people, Elvin added. &quot;They didn't expect to be targeted in this way. The perception of the UK abroad is still that it is a fair equitable country, where people are treated decently.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Croydon currently has just over 400 unaccompanied child asylum seekers, a higher number than most local authorities, because it is the location of Lunar House, the government office where people must go to claim asylum.But a council spokesperson said: &quot;This type of incident is extremely rare and our experience has been that the vast majority of young asylum seekers have been welcomed into the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the younger child refugees in Croydon and elsewhere are accommodated by the council in foster families, and will go to school in the borough. The older ones, aged 16 or 17, are more likely to be found beds in supported accommodation, and may attend English classes, but will not be in school. Some councils provide acclimatisation sessions for newly-arrived refugee children, educating them about British laws, the risks posed by drugs, and personal safety, but often the older arrivals are left largely unsupported to fend for themselves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liz Clegg, who worked with child asylum-seekers in Calais and is now helping child refugees to settle in the UK, said most were entirely unprepared for hostility. &quot;They think: 'Oh, now we're in the UK, we're completely safe.' They have fled conflict zones and think they have arrived in the promised land; they have a very positive outlook. We have to educate them that there are still serious dangers, that they need to be careful for their personal safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gulwali Passarlay, author of The Lightless Sky, an account of coming to the UK as a lone child asylum seeker from Afghanistan, said that attitudes towards refugees had hardened in recent months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He highlighted the negative effect of the reporting of the arrival of child refugees  from Calais last October (where the ages of the asylum-seekers were questioned in some parts of the media), stoking cynicism about child refugees' asylum claims, and dramatically souring a popular mood of support for child refugees which had followed the drowning of the three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The environment has changed. People with rightwing views think it is ok to insult asylum seekers. There are a lot of good people in the UK but the mood is changing. Asylum seekers need to be cautious; it's not always safe to walk around UK cities,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josie Naughton, co-founder of Help Refugees, said the attack demonstrated &quot;the level of fear and prejudice which is taking hold of parts of British society&quot;.Rabbi Janet Darley, who works with Citizens UK's Safe Passage project, which supports unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, said: &quot;This is a sobering reminder of the importance of the need to create a welcoming society, where refugees feel welcomed and accepted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donations to a crowd-funding site for the victim had reached over &pound;10,000 by Monday afternoon. Bridie Watson, who launched the fundraising drive, had no personal contact with the victim, but was liaising with the police and social services to make sure the victim received the money. &quot;It was so horrific. We wanted to help people put their shock and love into something positive. We want to show that this is not what the UK is about,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just one vulnerable child was brought to Northern Ireland under a scheme to let unaccompanied migrant children into the UK, it has been claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week it emerged that a key route to the UK for children caught up in Europe's migrant crisis would close after 350 arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the UK would stop receiving children via the so-called Dubs amendment at the end of March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, designed by peer and former refugee Lord Dubs, a former NIO official, aimed to help some of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied migrant children across Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International said just one unaccompanied child refugee was brought here under the Dubs scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Corrigan, the Northern Ireland programme director of Amnesty International, said: &quot;We can reveal that only one unaccompanied child refugee has been brought to Northern Ireland under this scheme. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With wars in Syria and elsewhere showing no signs of ending, there are thousands of desperate, unaccompanied children in need of refuge. Against that background, the fact that only one such vulnerable child has been settled in all of Northern Ireland under the scheme should shame the government for its lack of compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The announcement that the scheme is now to be ended with only 350 children helped, is a dismal reassertion of the government's refusal to share responsibility with European neighbours for what is a global crisis in urgent need of a collective response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By depriving refugee children of a safe route out of dangerous situations elsewhere, the Government only increases the risk that these children fall victim to traffickers and other abusers. The Home Secretary must think again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the government announced its intention to end its use of the Dubs scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement, named after its architect, Labour peer Lord Alf Dubs, requires the Government to relocate unaccompanied refugee children from other countries in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Dubs was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office from May 1997 to December 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the daughter of Sir Nicholas Winton - hailed as &quot;Britain's Schindler&quot; after saving hundreds of children from Nazi tyranny - called on Theresa May to reverse the closure of scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbara Winton's late father helped 669 mostly Jewish children flee Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia just before the outbreak of the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the Prime Minister, she wrote: &quot;Donald Trump's refugee ban echoes the terrible failures of the human spirit that, on the eve of the Second World War, saw country after country close its borders to Jewish refugees in urgent need of protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My father ... knew that each and every one of us share in a responsibility to our fellow men and women, a responsibility to offer sanctuary to those fleeing persecution. 'If it's not impossible', he used to say, 'then surely something could and something must be done'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversy erupted over the Dubs scheme after it emerged that it would come to an end after 150 unaccompanied children are brought to Britain, on top of 200 who have already arrived through the programme. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May insisted the Government's approach to assisting refugees is &quot;absolutely right&quot;, while the Home Secretary defended the approach to the Dubs scheme - saying British and French authorities feared it was acting as a &quot;pull factor&quot; for children to head to the UK and provided opportunities for people-traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office has insisted it is not giving up on vulnerable children and youngsters will continue to arrive from around the world through other resettlement schemes and the asylum system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Front National leader arrived at the Grande-Synthe camp in Dunkirk on Tuesday afternoon, along with several media outlets, but was refused authorisation to enter by organisations running the camp and regional authorities because she had turned up unannounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Ms Le Pen claimed it was a political move and that she was refused only because she &quot;doesn't agree with&quot; the organisers of the camp. She told BFMTV at the scene: &quot;It's a political move. They only let people in who agree with them,&quot; and later tweeted: &quot;Today we were prevented from entering the Grande-Synthe camp. That's French democracy for you!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) January 24, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Grande-Synthe authorities have said the reason she wasn't granted entry was because she failed to inform the organisations running the camp or the regional authorities that she was coming prior to her arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matilde Regne, a spokesperson for the mayor of Grand-Synthe, told</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;She didn't bother to let the organisations that run the camp know that she was coming. Neither the mayor, nor the organisation that manages the camp. No one was informed of her visit. She turned up completely unannounced,&quot; said Ms Regne.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She told the press that she likes that she was coming. We've had many high-profile figures visit the camp before, and all of them informed us beforehand, even journalists. It's important so that security can be organised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because she came without pre-warning, she wasn't given authorisation. You can't enter a humanitarian camp for refugees just like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tweet posted while she was standing outside the camp, Ms Le Pen denounced the &quot;crazy immigration policies&quot; by the French government. &quot;In front of the Grande-Synthe migrant camp, I denounced the crazy immigration policies carried out by successive governments,&quot; she wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must deport illegals back where they came from and control our national borders, if not the camps with reconstruct themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) January 24, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added in another tweet: &quot;Migrants are coming back to Calais and will ontinue to come as long as we don't control our borders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to France3, Damien Caerme, mayor of Grande-Synthe, said: &quot;It is not a zoo. It is out of the question for [Ms Le Pen] to make a buzz by coming to Grande-Synthe. What is she trying to achieve? She constantly incites hate and divisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Careme later tweeted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I refused Marine Le Pen access to the humanitarian camp who dared to present herself. Humanity is a value that she ignores.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J'ai refus&eacute; l'acc&egrave;s au camp humanitaire de la Lini&egrave;re &agrave; Marine Le Pen qui a os&eacute; s'y pr&eacute;senter ! L'humanit&eacute; est une valeur qu'elle ignore !</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Damien CAREME (@DamienCAREME) January 24, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are around 800 refugees residing in the Grande-Synthe camp, a number that has been growing since the demolition of the Calais 'Jungle', as refugees - particularly unaccompanied minors - flee from the accommodation centres across France they were taken to following the eviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Le Pen meanwhile boasts an openly anti-refugee policy, and controlling France's borders is one of the principle objectives in her election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, the Front National leader, whose father was convicted over racial hatred, xenophobia and anti-Semitism, denounced the EU as &quot;a force of sterilisation&quot; and attacked German Chancellor Angela Merkel for her refugee policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British lifeguard has revealed the harrowing realities from working on &quot;the front line&quot; of Europe's migration crisis .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Heard has rescued dozens of migrants and refugees from the Aegean Sea, where he lifted month-old babies to safety and reassured panicked mothers their little ones were still alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 32-year-old from Devon, helped terrified refugees left stranded on slippery rocks after smugglers threw them into freezing water near the shore in a bid to escape authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard said most of the boats were &quot;incredibly unsafe&quot; and were full of terrified crying children in fake life jackets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brave Brit spoke out after completing three missions to the Greek island of Lesbos to save lives on what he calls &quot;the front line&quot; of Europe's migration crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was having to carry babies that were months old back into the water and out to the boat, numerous times,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just 34,000 out of 1.2 million refugees have managed to get a job since arriving in Germany</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes in the dark, sometimes in daylight, freezing cold, and, as you can imagine, these people have just been through a massive ordeal, dropped on a strange coastline in the dark, their luggage, their phone - everything they own is either gone or soaked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're stranded and we are the first faces they see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mothers are asking me if their babies are alive, if their babies are okay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Half of them think I am the authority and am going to send them back to Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a huge ordeal reassuring them, calming them down, getting them to trust you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many of the refugees the crew encountered were wearing life jackets, Mr Heard said these were fake, stuffed with foam packaging that soaks up sea water and loses its buoyancy within minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the migrants would buy them on market stalls in coastal towns after parting with thousands of pounds for a ticket to take them to Europe - &quot;another part of the atrocity that people are taking advantage of and cashing in on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalled: &quot;Every single boat or smuggler drop that we assisted there would be a good percentage of vulnerable people on them, whether they're elderly, disabled or injured, and every single boat would have infants or kids, families with children or tiny babies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These dinghies are incredibly unsafe, incredibly unfit for the sea, and they are one of the main causes for the horrendous scenes we've seen - the drowning kids - these dinghies capsize, they become overwhelmed, deflate, their engines come off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life in the shadow of ISIS: Inside the terror-ruined towns where families face bombs, poverty and deadly smoke</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a nutshell, the thing that gets me now is screaming, crying babies and women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I hear that on television, if I think about it, it's not very nice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretty much every boat that we met had screaming kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lifeguard, from Hartland, dedicated around 14 weeks last year, initially going out at the beginning of 2016, returning in May to the south of the island and completing a two-month stint further north in Skala Sikamineas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As team leader on an old RNLI lifeboat, he has spent the time on call 24/7 responding to distress alerts and saving between 50-60 people at a time from 10m inflatable dinghies he describes as &quot;incredibly unsafe, incredibly unfit for the sea&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more recently, the Refugee Rescue team have been conducting &quot;rock rescues&quot; - which involves patrolling secluded coves on the Lesbos coastline for small groups smuggled across in speedboats that stealthily zig-zag the usually-short route under the cover of darkness to avoid the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then they drop the refugees - if they're lucky - on to a nice sandy beach, but more often than not they just throw them in the water near the rocks and let the refugees swim the last few metres to Europe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands could have to swear an oath to &quot;British values&quot; under Tory plans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As soon as we find refugees we would then go through the tasks of having to get them, half the time back off the land because they're stuck in secluded coves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They throw them in really nasty places and the reason is these places are quiet, the authority's boats can't come in close to catch them, so it's very, very dangerous for the refugees, especially at this time of year when it's getting very cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 7.5-metre metre boat called Mo Chara (&quot;my friend&quot; in Gaelic), has helped nearly 3,500 people to safety, working alongside another NGO Proactiva, the Hellenic coastguard, the EU border agency Frontex and Nato warships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rescues came as hundreds of people have been attempting to cross the border from Turkey to Greece every week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A record 5,000 migrants are now believed to have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea this year following two shipwrecks on Thursday in which some 100 are feared dead, aid agencies said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two overcrowded dinghies capsized in the Strait of Sicily between Italy and Libya , the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those two incidents together appear to be the numbers that would bring this year's total to 5,000 (deaths), which is a new high in this crisis,&quot; IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a Geneva briefing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the worst annual death toll ever seen,&quot; said UNHCR spokesman William Spindler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 3,777 migrants perished at sea during all of 2015, the IOM said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR appealed to states to open up more legal pathways for admitting refugees .</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OFFICIALS in the Swedish government have been accused of &quot;covering up&quot; migrant rape and refugee violence for the sake of appearing politically correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalist Ami Horowitz&nbsp;told Fox News&nbsp;people high up in the Swedish government are deliberately covering up and protecting perpetrators of rapes to protect &quot;vulnerable&quot; migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an explosive interview on Friday, Mr Horowitz claimed the refugee violence crisis was out of control but that &quot;European virtues&quot; had put a stop to any discussion on the statistics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His claims caused Donald Trump to tell a rally in Florida that migration in Europe was out of control and wrongly claim there had been a security incident in Sweden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later said his comments were actually in reference to the Fox report rather than one specific incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweden accepted 160,000 asylum-seekers last year, with Fox reporting only 500 have managed to gain employment - 0.3 per cent of those who arrived to claim refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOX; GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucker Carlson, an anchor at the US news station, called Sweden's response &quot;grotesque&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horowitz said: &quot;Sweden consider themselves a humanitarian superpower, perhaps the only superpower they could possibly qualify for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So they want to open up their borders up to everyone and anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the onset of the refugee crisis, there was a surge in gun violence and rape - the statistics were clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But locals were just said 'it was men, not refugees' so the majority in Sweden still want to have an open door policy. It's confounding, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued: &quot;The Swedish government try to cover up refugee rapes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were a spate of violent attacks and sexual assaults at a music festival but officials tried to cover up who the perpetrators&nbsp;were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has gone out of its way to cover up these figures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOX</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swedish government are 'purposely covering up' the prepretrators of rape crimes to protect migrants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucker Carlson, an anchor at Fox, called Sweden's response &quot;grotesque&quot; before saying that &quot;Western masochism knows no bounds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Stefan L&ouml;fven implemented border controls in October 2016 and a study by think tank Demos this week found there had been an increasing use of the term &quot;Swedish values&quot; by all parties, since the beginning of 2015, as they began to recognise public concerns.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many fear that the high levels of unemployment among migrants in Sweden means greater social unrest will be inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the interview, Horowitz warned if Sweden did not change its policy soon, then they will have to prepare for &quot;social unrest and terrorism just like in France and Belgium&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump alluded to a security incident which took place in Sweden over the weekend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOX</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Horowitz warned if Sweden did not change its policy soon, they will face terrorism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Horowitz said that the refugee violence crisis was out-of-control</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition politicians have attacked the country's leaders for siding too often &quot;with the murderers rather than the victims&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interview on Fox was framed in a debate on 'What the US could learn from Sweden's refugee policy'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comes as Donald Trump revealed plans to roll out a new executive order on immigrant restrictions next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a press conference on Thursday, the US President told the media: &quot;We had a very smooth roll out of the travel ban - but we had a very bad court decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we're going to fix that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERESA May today defended the Government's decision to limit on the number of lone child refugees coming to Britain in the face of stinging criticism from the Archbishop of Canterbury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PA/EPA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May has defended her stance on refugee children despite Justin Welby's criticism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Most Rev Justin Welby was &quot;saddened and shocked&quot; by ministers capping the scheme at a maximum of 350 unaccompanied youngsters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Prime Minister insisted the limit was &quot;absolutely right&quot; for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The angry row erupted yesterday when Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed the decision to set a maximum on the number of unaccompanied children allowed into the UK under the scheme. She feared the scheme to help youngsters fleeing war-torn Syria - introduced in response to pressure from Labour peer Lord Dubs - could be abused by people trafficking gangs intent on smuggling illegal migrants into Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Brexiteer RAGES against Archbishop of Canterbury for Remain vote  Theresa May pledges extra &pound;30MILLION to protect refugees&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May later defended the Government's approach, saying: &quot;We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right, on top of course of the significant financial support and humanitarian aid we are giving to refugees in the region of Syria - a commitment of &pound;2.3 billion, the second biggest bilateral donor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May spoke out in defence of the Government approach after the Archbishop released a statement criticising the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Welby said: &quot;I was saddened and shocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our country has a great history of welcoming those in need, particularly the most vulnerable, such as unaccompanied children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugees, like all people, are treasured human beings made in the image of God who deserve safety, freedom and the opportunity to flourish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Welby also cited a quote from Jesus in the Bible saying: &quot;Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had expected around 3,000 unaccompanied children to be allowed into Britain as a result of the so-called 'Dubs Amendment' to immigration legislation, which set up the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Rev Welby said he was shocked and saddened by the decision </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archbishop added: &quot;To end the scheme now, when such a small proportion have actually entered the country, is regrettable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local authorities, who are bearing the costs of the resettlement, must be given the resources and time needed to meet our original commitment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded: &quot;We must resist and turn back the worrying trends we are seeing around the world, towards seeing the movement of desperate people as more of a threat to identity and security than an opportunity to do our duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot withdraw from our long and proud history of helping the most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I very much hope that the Government will reconsider this decision, and work with church groups and others to find a sustainable and compassionate solution that allows those most in need to find sanctuary in our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirming the limit in the Commons earlier, Ms Rudd claimed the Dubs Amendment was encouraging youngsters to head to Europe from the Middle East and leaving them vulnerable to people traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It acts as a pull. It encourages the people traffickers,&quot; the Home Secretary said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government have always been clear that we do not want to incentivise perilous journeys to Europe, particularly by the most vulnerable children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amber Rudd said maximum will be set on the number of unaccompanied children allowed into the UK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have done what we were obliged to do, and we have correctly put a number on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Rudd insisted that the child refugee scheme was not &quot;closed&quot; permanently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that the decision to put a limit on the numbers followed talks with local authorities providing accommodation for refugees about their capacity for looking after unaccompanied minors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are grateful for the way in which local authorities have stepped up to provide places for those arriving, and we will continue to work closely to address capacity needs,&quot; the Home Secretary said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour MP Yvette Cooper said the decision to impose the limit was &quot;shameful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Rev Welby had expected around 3,000 unaccompanied children to be allowed into Britain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And she compared the refugee scheme to the &quot;Kindertransport&quot; evacuation of Jewish child refugees from the Nazis during the 1930s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;This was an important way for Britain to do its bit in a global refugee crisis just as we did through the Kindertransport generations ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is shameful that the Government has stopped it so soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory backbencher Peter Bone said Ms Cooper's demand for the limit to be scrapped was &quot;absolutely wrong&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;If we continue to take unaccompanied children into this country, more and more will be taken from Syria and across the dreadful sea routes, with many dying, and we will be feeding and encouraging human trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I urge the Home Secretary to continue to take people from Syria, but to abandon taking them from Europe, which encourages human trafficking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a Tory MP with Jewish ancestry described Ms Cooper's reference to the Kindertransport as &quot;distasteful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Farbricant said: &quot;Like Lord Dubs, I share Jewish extraction ancestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;May I just say how distasteful I find it when I hear some commentators compare the situation today with that in the 1930s and the Kindertransport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In those days there was no opportunity to go into Germany or the axis countries and assist those children who faced death in concentration camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this situation it is very different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I simply ask, will she condemn those commentators - thankfully no one, so far, in this House - who do compare the situation in the 30s with today?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Rudd agreed, saying: &quot;He makes a very good point. It's not the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps the one comparison one might make is the conditions sometimes of the camps out in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There, where there are some terrible situations - there is a terrible situation in some of the camps - is where we should put all our effort, to make sure that we take the children that we can from that most vulnerable area.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Di Hammill and Lee Wood travelled to the Dunkirk Refugee camp in Grande-Synthe to supply it with donations from their customers, after failimng to find people in need in Calais after the notorious jungle was cleared last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Di, who with Lee runs the Wild Harvest School of Self-Reliance, in East Cottingwith, near York, has revealed some of the darker sides of the five-day experience last month in a blog sent to Express.co.uk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told of the dangers of the Dunkirk camp, where a women's centre for refugees was burnt down by migrants just weeks after it opened, as revealed by Express.co.uk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrote: &quot;We were warned about the dangers of theft and of sexual violence </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything it seems is a commodity to be taken and used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The camp had institutionalised desperate and passive refugees, or had they brought it here as a negative cultural phenomenon - I can say this as I'm a left wing softie full of compassion for displaced people but what I saw here made me wonder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were told that the camps had a mafia who organised the acquisition and distribution of black market commodity items.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;We walked up to the medical centre to see if we could find the lady who showed us in, it was a run down house with builders' fences around it and a sign on the door saying &quot;no guns' in image form.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair brought donations of toothpaste, toothbrushes, wipes, nappies, toiletries and energy bars, and wanted to distribute them to people at the camp, but were warned it could lead to rioting from anyone who was left out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrote that they were told &quot;they can't allow this type of random donating that we had intended as riots can break out when one family or person sees another get something they haven't got.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrote: &quot;Community organisation and self-responsibility could be fostered more than it is at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally don't think there is anything wrong with expectations of self responsibility and couldn't understand why volunteers had flown from the US to pick up the litter that was filling the ditches.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Initially tempted to help, I thought actually no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[The refugees] are sat drinking coffee all day in the tent, they could keep warm with a weekly litter picking session. In the Second World War when the British were being bombed and lacked resources, we rallied round, build community, grew veg and picked up our own litter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attempts had been made presumably by the initial Utopia 56 volunteers to create raised beds and communal areas but none of these had been maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was clear the refugees were passive in their role there, waiting and waiting but not claiming the space as their own in the meantime. We felt so much more could be done in the way of creating community through participation and participation through community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did wonder why [the men in the camp] didn't offer to help rebuild the women's centre or pick up litter, but that is me wondering about the void of apathy that must come from living like that having travelled far and with an uncertain future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, although the trip left the pair disappointed, as much by the lack of organisation among some volunteer groups as the apathy of the migrants themselves, they have vowed to try to help again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She finished her blog saying: &quot;We are thinking about how this community building could be done while trying to respect cultural norms to some extent, but insisting basic camp survival has to come first, and after more experience of the camp, next time may dare to suggest some ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lee had an idea for empowering the male members of the site, if culturally, status and authority were important to them, could the known 'mafia' members be put into a council and given an actual sense of responsibility for the whole site... work with the underlying emotions that are met by being &quot;boss&quot; of a community rather than trying to quash it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union has been warned against stranding thousands of refugees in &quot;concentration camp-like&quot; prisons by making a controversial deal with Libya to stem the flow of migrants over the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country is the main launching point for hundreds of thousands of migrants who have crossed to Europe fleeing war, persecution and the dire conditions in Libya itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities and militias stand accused of killing, shooting, torturing, detaining and exploiting asylum seekers amid the bloody chaos of the continuing civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national coastguard, being trained by Britain and other European nations, has also attacked rescue vessels run by humanitarian groups, causing 25 people to drown in one incident.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the EU is expected to hand Libyan authorities more responsibility for refugee operations, potentially allowing the forced return of boats, following a summit in Malta today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef said that after the deadliest ever winter for refugees, seeing at least 190 children drown in the past three months, the lives of thousands were at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justin Forsyth, the agency's deputy executive director, said: &quot;The decisions taken at Friday's summit could literally mean the difference between life and death for thousands of children transiting or stranded in Libya.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The EU is yet again outsourcing its responsibility to protect the rights of migrants and refugees with no guarantees about what will happen to the many men, women and children after they have been returned to Libya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The route from Libya into the Central Mediterranean has become the main passage to Europe after a controversial agreement struck with Turkey last year, which dramatically reduced the number of boats crossing the Aegean Sea by seeing everyone arriving on Greek islands detained under threat of deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A repeat of the EU-Turkey deal has been mooted but is considered impossible in light of the continuing conflict in Libya, where the new Government of National Accord is struggling to stop battles between a plethora of warring militias including Islamists and Isis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrants are a profitable business for gangs who detain them in makeshift prisons, either holding them for ransom or forcing them into labour or prostitution amid widespread lawlessness following the British-backed ousting of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leaked report by German diplomats described the horrific conditions &quot;like concentration camps&quot;, where survivors described daily executions &quot;to make room for new arrivals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The asylum seekers who manage to escape are more likely to die attempting the treacherous journey across the Mediterranean than ever before, with more than 5,000 drowning, suffocating or freezing to death in overloaded smugglers' boats last year alone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump has banned nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries from entering the US - a rule which could affect many Brits with dual passports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Foreign Office is still unable to advise worried Brits affected by Trump's new 'Muslim ban'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US President announced on Friday that all refugees would be banned from entering America.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trumpalso banned nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries from entering the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it emerged last night that Brits holding dual passports to one of those countries could also be barred from entering America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them could be Olympic hero Sir Mo Farah who has dual Somali-British citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees detained and 'turned away' at US airports after Donald Trump signs executive order</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office is now under increasing pressure to offer advice to worried Brits planning to travel to the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mirror Onlinespoke to the Foreign Office, which confirmed it did not have any guidance yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said it was talking to the State Department in the US to clarify travel advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office website shows its section on travel advice to the US was last updated last Monday - days before Trump announced his strict new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the Liberal Democrats Tim Farron last night urgedTheresa Mayto order the Foreign Office to issue urgent advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Today Theresa May said that Donald Trump's ban on people from Muslim countries was purely a matter for America. We now learn that the State Department apparently advises that the visa ban also applies to people with dual nationality, which will include Britons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even allowing for her cosying up to Donald Trump, it would be a gross abdication of her responsibilities to all British citizens if she doesn't take this up with her new best friend now, making clear that anyone with a British passport and a visa should be allowed safe passage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She must also order the Foreign Office to deliver urgently advice to British citizens travelling to the United States on whether they should continue to travel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement that the State Department is reportedly due to release, seen by The Wall Street Journal, the ban also applies to people originally from one of the seven banned countries but who are traveling on a passport issued by any other nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore Iraqis or Syrians wanted to enter the U.S. on a British passport will be barred, according to a U.S. official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British citizens don't normally require a visa to enter the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister said she &quot;does not agree&quot; with Trump's ban on migrants and refugees from Muslim countries, her spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister came under pressure to condemn the President's move to bar refugees from entering the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May repeatedly dodged the questions when asked for her view on the policy during a press conference in Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the hours that followed, her position became increasingly isolated as Europeans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued in the early hours of Sunday, a spokesman for No 10 said: &quot;Immigration policy in the United States is a matter for the government of the United States, just the same as immigration policy for this country should be set by our government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are studying this new executive order to see what it means and what the legal effects are, and in particular what the consequences are for UK nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police defend 999 response time to attempted kidnap of student after judge calls for answers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is any impact on UK nationals then clearly we will make representations to the US government about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May finds herself in an uncomfortable position - having spoken glowingly of the UK's 'special relationship' with America and was pictured holding hands with Trump during her recent visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But later, when pressed by reporters at the event in Ankara, Turkey, she insisted it was up to America to devise its own policy on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her Turkish counterpart Binali Yildirim, however, hit out at the ban, warning the US that building a wall would not solve the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the joint conference, Mrs May told reporters: &quot;The United States is responsible for the United States policy on refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom's policy on refugees and our policy on refugees is to have a number of voluntary schemes to bring Syrian refugees into the country, particularly those who are most vulnerable, but also to provide significant financial contributions to support refugees in countries surrounding Syria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PM was immediately condemned by British politicians, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former leader Ed Miliband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump, who was inaugurated as the 45th US President on January 20, has barred all refugees from entering the country for four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he has blocked those from war-ravaged Syria indefinitely as part of a plan to stop &quot;radical Islamic terrorists&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His order, signed on Friday afternoon, also imposes a 90-day ban on entry to the US from seven Muslim-majority nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about the changes made by the president, Mrs May focused on the action taken by the UK to help refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed a second time, the PM - who held talks with Mr Trump and was even pictured holding his hand in Washington on Friday - failed to answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She finally addressed the question when reporters shouted out &quot;what about the US?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Donald Trump has put his &quot;Muslim ban&quot; in place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The so called &quot;Muslim ban&quot; came into affect after the new US president signed an executive order to prevent people from mainly Islamic countries from entering America - just days into his presidency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump has closed US borders to all refugees for the next four months and has put a temporary ban in place for people travelling from half a dozen countries - even if they've been issued visas in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He first proposed the ban whie he was a contender to become the Republican party's nominee for US president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time he faced international condemnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as he signed the order at the Pentagon on Friday he made good on his promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US border control must now turn travellers away from Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia over the next 90 days.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslim travellers have reportedly been stopped from boarding flights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only exceptions will be diplomats and dual citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Al Rawi took to Facebook to say her father, a Muslim, had already been subject to the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;My 71 year old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and and he's being sent back to Iraq. Some US official told him that Trump canceled all visas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian refugees have been banned from the country indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will face particularly stringent restrictions and were singled out as &quot;detrimental to the interests of the United states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US president has also instigated a 120-day suspension on the US refugee resettlement programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Trump has closed US borders to all refugees for the next four months</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme had allowed 85,000 people from war-torn countries to start a new life in the United States last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees will now be admitted on a case-by-case basis. Those claiming religious persecution will be processed and admitted if their religion is a minority religion in their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Ryan, the republican speaker of the House, appeared to support the move saying: &quot;It is time to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Trump's move came under fierce criticism from civil rights campaigners, Democrat senators and business leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader said: &quot;Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it planned to file a federal lawsuit against the ban next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lena Masri, the group's director of National Litigation said: &quot;There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google urged its staff that was affected by the ban to come back to the US immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook wrote in a post that he was concerned about the impact of the executive orders and planned to work with a charity called Fwd.US to create protections for child immigrants brought to the US by their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Al Rawi took to Facebook to say her father had been subject to the ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Refugee Agency and International Organisation for Migration, both based in Geneva, called on Mr Trump to continue to take refugees fleeing war or persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the U.S. resettlement programme is one of the most important in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees often bring with them creative energies, innovations and ideas, and host communities are enriched by their plurality of political, social and cultural mosaic and civic life. It is imperative for governments to come to grips with the colossal magnitude of the refugee crisis and share responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No country -irrespective of its wealth -can accommodate millions of people in need of shelter, water, security, employment, education, medicine and healthcare. But it is unfair for the US (one of the wealthiest countries on earth) to ban refugees from specific Muslim countries or give special preferences for Christian minorities. We cannot shirk our responsibilities to offer succour to the wretched and vulnerable and to address the root causes that force refugees to flee their homes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are we still trying to force a nonexistent 'special relationship'?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's election has been a profound and alarming shock to the world, so why does the UK wish to develop a &quot;special relationship&quot; with such a man? Trump will use any trade deal with the UK to his benefit and to our detriment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as we have lost the protection of the European Customs Union, Trump and his henchmen will take Mrs May and Boris Johnson to the cleaners. For the UK to embrace this man is a disgrace - we should all be ashamed of our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For him to be invited on a state visit to be entertained by our Queen must make us all wonder what we have come to. Mrs May's return from Washington can be likened to Chamberlain's return from Munich, only this time we are putting our trust in an evil man who will do even longer-lasting damage than the man Chamberlain shook hands with.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US's misogynistic stance on abortion cannot be likened to Britain's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I fear that Siobhan Fenton is absolutely right about the misogyny that remains deeply endemic in society on both sides of the Atlantic. However there is, I believe, a fundamental and qualitative difference between our two cultures on the issue of abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far as I am aware there are no siren voices in mainland Britain seriously arguing for abortion to be outlawed. As I understand it the recent challenges by Maria Miller and Jeremy Hunt were about revising the time limit for abortion in the context of foetus viability, not the acceptance of the principle of abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As science progresses there will always be legitimate debate about the rights, if any, of the unborn child, their primacy over the mother's, and balancing the two. However this should not be confused with our long-accepted principle that abortion is not a crime per se.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May without realising it may find herself set on a course of action that could destroy the lives of tens of thousands of British expats and families. Her current mantra is &quot;no deal is better than a bad deal&quot;, but the question is, better for whom? Certainly not British expats in Europe with EU National families, or EU expats in Britain with British families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My fear is that as a result of May's recent talks with Trump and the distant possibility of a deal on trade, she could be emboldened to actually believe that &quot;hard Brexit&quot; is an acceptable option and leave the EU without having reached an agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such an approach could separate families living abroad or effectively stop British citizens from coming back to the UK if they wished to stay with their families. If it all goes wrong May could find herself the first British Prime Minister in history who sacrificed thousands of her own people and their families on the altar of the anti-immigration sentiment that is Brexit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing and reading all the information concerning the infamous Mexican wall, I think the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is being a little too quick off the mark and a bit naive. He should agree with the building of the wall and the one major benefit that comes with it: it would help keep the &quot;Trumpster&quot; out of Mexico. A price well worth paying. Every cloud, as they say...</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pair of young farmhands wait for a ride at an idle junction under a coconut palm on a blistering day in south Belize. A short drive east is a fishing village of Garifunas - mixed-race descendants of African slaves and indigenous Arawaks - while along the highway to the west are clusters of Mayan thatched huts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's too hot to walk the few miles to Bella Vista, a dusty Spanish-speaking migrant community whose inhabitants mostly work in the surrounding banana plantations and shrimp farms - part of the steady flow of seasonal labourers from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, drawn here by higher wages and plentiful work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belize has long counted on its neighbours to prop up its sugar cane and fruit farms, but in recent years, violence in the three countries has generated a surge in new arrivals searching not for work, but for survival.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Central America's rampant violence fuels an invisible refugee crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corrupt security forces, international drug cartels and warring street gangs have helped turn the region - known as the Northern Triangle - into the world's most deadly outside an official conflict zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The bloodshed has generated a refugee crisis across the region, and last year prompted the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to reopen an office in Belize after an absence of almost 20 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latest uptick in Spanish-speaking refugees is stoking populist anti-Hispanic sentiments and has prompted the government to adopt a hardline approach which contrasts with Belize's past generosity - and flies in the face of the country's international obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly how many new refugees have come to Belize is unknown, but more than 4,000 people have either applied for asylum or been identified as people of concern by the UNHRC. The actual number is likely much higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enrique Cruz, 30, arrived in Bella Vista last year after he was shot on the way home from a friend's funeral in northern Honduras. He was forced to abandon his barber's shop and went into hiding, until he made his way to Belize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Cruz ekes out a leaving by giving haircuts in the doorway of his tiny wooden shack. He can't afford the work visa that would allow him to get a farm job; he hasn't applied for asylum for fear of being deported if he is turned down. Cruz feels safe for now, but his situation is precarious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time this tiny country has harboured victims of neighbouring conflicts. In the 1980s and 1990s, Belize was an oasis of peace amid Central America's interlocking civil wars between US-supported despots and leftwing guerrillas. It was widely praised for welcoming about 30,000 Spanish-speaking refugees - a 10% increase in the population, which changed the country's ethnic mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But its reputation as a safe haven is under threat amid government claims that the new wave of asylum seekers threaten Belize's security, economic stability and cultural heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former British colony, with a population of 360,000, is the most sparsely populated country in the region, and the only one whose official language is English. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sizeable Mennonite, Amish, Lebanese, Chinese, and Indian communities live alongside indigenous Mayans and Garifunas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the 1990s, the country's main ethnic group consisted of black English-speaking Creoles - the descendants of African slaves - who identify as Caribbean, not Central American. Creoles still dominate politics and the media, but after waves of migration to the US, they now account for a quarter of the population. Over half of Belizeans now identify as Mestizo or Latin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those demographic shifts - as well as unresolved territorial claims by Guatemala and unsubstantiated rumours that Central American street gangs are targeting Belize - have helped fuel anti-Latino sentiment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such sentiments have in turn prompted a hardline policy on refugees: since the country's asylum scheme reopened a year ago, not a single applicant has been accepted. Many other refugees are unaware the asylum process even exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in an interview with the Guardian, the country's migration minister suggested that it would be unlikely for any to be accepted any time soon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why should I approve any cases if I don't have the confidence that we are prepared to deal with the problems?&quot; said Beverly Williams. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an interview in Ladyville, her predominantly Creole constituency, Williams drew a parallel with the Trump administration's targeting of El Salvador's MS13 gang. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America doesn't want the MS13 gang, so why would Belize? The majority of asylum seekers are from El Salvador ... We don't have the structures in place to ensure they are not gang members,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Belize is the only English-speaking country and the most peaceful in Central America. We're going to be careful in what we introduce because politically we will be impacted,&quot; she added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's stance means that some would-be asylum seekers are too scared to seek protection - and may even be forced to return home to dangerous situations, said Kelleen Corrigan, a UNHCR protection officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hidden people are vulnerable people, so it's a priority to understand the magnitude of the issue and help the government fulfil its international obligations to identify refugees more quickly by setting up a fair and efficient system,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there's little incentive for them to come forward, as many would be rejected under current government policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes strict retrospective application of a 14-day rule which gives people two weeks to apply for asylum - even though many are traumatised, don't speak English or don't understand the system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams accuses UNHCR of unfairly pressuring Belize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is aware of its obligations but there can be no microwave solution just because there are international mandates and agendas to meet,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current stalemate comes amid growing fears that Trump's anti-immigrant policies will prompt more Central American refugees to seek safety closer to home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico is expecting more than 20,000 asylum applications this year - almost quadruple the number in 2015 - and it seems inevitable that more refugees will head to Belize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Benque Viejo, the busiest land crossing with Guatemala, 8,355 Salvadorans crossed legally in 2016 - a 23% rise on 2014. There was a 12% increase in Hondurans over the same period, though they mostly arrived by boat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unknown how many cross the porous border unlawfully, said Nikolai Zelaya, deputy port commander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, Zelaya arrested a Honduran man scrambling along the Mopan river bank. He was detained pending an investigationand could face a six month jail term or US$500 fine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highway heading north is flanked by citrus groves and fields of sugar cane, framed by lush rolling hills on the horizon. On the roadside, an Amish farmer loads his horse-driven wagon next to Mayans hawking tropical fruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten miles from the capital, Belmopan, is the rapidly expanding Spanish-speaking village Armenia, which was established for refugees in the early 1980s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reina Morales, 66, from Guatemala, was one of the first settlers. &quot;We found peace here and never left. The new people are looking for the same thing,&quot; said Morales, relishing the cooler twilight air on her veranda after a stifling day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All around, neighbours are building tiny wooden huts to house newcomers such as Ruben Chong, 23, from Honduras, who lives with Morales' granddaughter Tanya and their infant daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chong first came here in 2012 after his brother was abducted and found decapitated. Six months later, another brother, a taxi driver, was also murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chong obtained temporary work visas and found employment on a citrus farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in 2015, a cash-for-visas scandal triggered widespread outcry and the subsequent government crackdown threw the work programme into disarray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jobless without a visa, Chong returned to Honduras, but was threatened by the same gang who killed his taxi driver brother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He escaped back to Belize in early 2016, and this time registered for asylum with local NGO Help for Progress, which was authorized to receive applicants while the government revived its dormant refugee scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past year the refugee eligibility committee has recommended 75 cases be granted asylum. But none have been approved by minister Williams, so they remain in limbo, unable to work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melanie Smith, sociologist and migration expert at the University of Belize, said the government was dragging its feet because Central Americans have been cast as social pariahs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a priority for the government; they won't act unless there is international condemnation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chong, a victim of gang violence, is frantic. &quot;I'm stuck between yes and no. I can't provide for my family, but I can't go home,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divisions between Donald Trump and other members of the G7 at the summit in Sicily have become so broad and deep that they may be forced to issue a brief leaders' statement rather than a full communique, dashing Italian hopes of engineering a big step forward on migration and famine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the US president apparently reluctant to compromise with European leaders over climate change, trade and migration, the European council president, Donald Tusk, was forced to admit on Friday that this would be the most challenging G7 summit in years and there was a risk of events spiralling out of control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Donald Trump offers shoves and strange handshakes on the world stage | Ross Barkan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A draft statement shown to the Guardian reveals Trump wants world leaders to make only a short reference to migration and to throw out a plan by the Italian hosts for a comprehensive five-page statement that acknowledges migrants' rights, the factors driving refugees and their positive contribution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian plans - one on human movement and another on food security - were set to be the centrepiece of its summit diplomacy. Italy had chosen Taormina in Sicily as the venue to symbolise the world's concern over the plight of refugees coming from the Middle East and Africa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had hoped the summit would end on Saturday with a bold statement that the world, and not just individual nations, had a responsibility for the refugee crisis. Italy is expected to take in 200,000 refugees in 2017; more than 1,300 have drowned so far this year while trying to make the perilous crossing from north Africa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's negotiators brought a new brief text of the final communique to a pre-meeting of the G7 on 26 April and said they were vetoing the Italian &quot;human mobility&quot; plan, which had been the subject of careful negotiation for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new text, offered by the US on a take it or leave it basis, acknowledges the human rights of migrants, but affirms &quot;the sovereign rights of states to control their own borders and set clear limits on net migration levels as key elements of their national security&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also asserts the need for refugees to be supported as close to their home countries as possible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic sources said intense talks were under way to rescue some of the Italian agenda on migration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian officials, faced with little option, insisted the brief wording on migration in the draft represented a good compromise and said there was no problem with the Americans. The communique did reference the idea of &quot;upstream&quot; action on the issue - but also supporting legal pathways to return individuals to their country of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign of the immediacy of the refugee crisis, the Libyan coastguard said as many as 20 boats had been spotted off the Libyan coast on Friday carrying thousands of migrants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large rescue and interception operations were under way with the help of the Libyan coastguard, fishing and commercial boats and in coordination with the Italian authorities, the navy spokesman Gen Ayoub Qassem said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the day of a massive exodus of illegal migrants toward Europe,&quot; he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disagreements between Trump and other world leaders have spread to climate change, trade and food security, revealing the philosophical gulf about how to handle globalisation and security. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source said that with four leaders attending their first summit - Trump, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the UK and Italian prime ministers, Theresa May and Paolo Gentiloni - the emphasis was being placed on the politicians building a personal bond of trust rather than delivering lengthy communiques. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the end of the first day's formal session, Gentiloni said agreement had been reached on terrorism and Syria, but Trump was holding out on climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is one open question, which is the US position on the Paris climate accords ... All others have confirmed their total agreement on the accord,&quot; he said. &quot;We are sure that after an internal reflection, the United States will also want to commit to it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump has come under pressure from other world leaders to stick with the UN climate change treaty signed by Barack Obama's administration in Paris. He has deferred a decision on whether the US will pull out of the 2015 deal. The Trump administration is internally divided and might simply reduce the level and timescale of US commitments made at Paris on emission cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said &quot;we put forward very many arguments&quot; for the US sticking with the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May also raised the issue of climate change admitting that &quot;the US is considering its position in relation to these matters&quot; but claiming all seven countries agreed on the importance of the Paris agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late on Friday, a senior White House official said Trump's views on climate change were &quot;evolving&quot; following the talks. &quot;He feels much more knowledgeable on the topic today,&quot; said Gary Cohn, Trump's top White House economic adviser. &quot;He came here to learn; he came here to get smarter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Trump 'complained to Belgian PM of difficulty setting up golf resorts in EU'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign of the tensions over trade, a senior Trump adviser confirmed that the president had criticised Germany as &quot;very bad&quot; on trade at a meeting with EU officials in Brussels on Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said they're very bad on trade, but he doesn't have a problem with Germany,&quot; White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday night, Gentiloni said the leaders had made progress on the issue of foreign trade, but that the wording of the final communique still needed to be worked out. Trump has previously promoted a protectionist agenda that alarmed his G7 allies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gentiloni said: &quot;On the major theme of global trade, we are still working on the shape of the final communique, but it seems to me the direct discussions today have produced common positions that we can work on.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany and Japan are trying to pin Trump down to define his version of fair trade by making him accept there has to be a rules-based system in which the World Trade Organisation has a leading role. Trump has vowed that he will cut the US deficit and has pointed the finger of blame at countries such as Germany and China. He has accused China of using exchange rate manipulation to sell goods in the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German trade surplus, which reached a record $283bn in 2016, has also been a source of contention within Europe, with Berlin's partners encouraging it to do more to promote domestic demand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man chose to remain anonymous because his wife and child are still living in war-wracked Aleppo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order marked the first ruling against the revised directive, which temporarily closes US borders to all refugees and citizens from six mainly-Muslim countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It denies US entry to all refugees for 120 days and halts for 90 days the granting of visas to nationals from Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new order, unveiled Monday, is due to go into effect March 16.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lifting an indefinite Syrian refugee travel ban and reducing the number of blacklisted countries by removing Iraq, it replaces a previous iteration issued in January that was blocked in federal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The court appreciates that there may be important differences between the original executive order and the revised executive order issued on March 6, 2017,' Conley wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'As the order applies to the plaintiff here, however, the court finds his claims have at least some chance of prevailing for the reasons articulated by other courts.' He set a hearing for March 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another legal challenge, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint on behalf of several refugee assistance groups over the controversial executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Putting a new coat of paint on the Muslim ban doesn't solve its fundamental problem, which is that the Constitution and our laws prohibit religious discrimination,' said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's immigrant rights project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The further President Trump goes down this path, the clearer it is that he is violating that basic rule.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLU, the preeminent US civil liberties group, and the National Immigration Law Center brought the suit on behalf of the International Refugee Assistance Project and the refugee resettlement group HIAS, as well as several individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit alleges that the new executive order violates the constitutional protection of freedom of religion in that it is 'intended and designed to target and discriminate against Muslims, and it does just that in operation'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Rarely in American history has governmental intent to discriminate against a particular faith and its adherents been so plain,' the complaint says, alleging the new order will cause 'irreparable harm' and asking for an injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal judge in Maryland, Theodore Chuang, has scheduled a hearing in the case for March 15 -- the day before the measure is due to take effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, a federal judge in Seattle who issued a nationwide halt to Trump's original travel restrictions denied a motion to have the same ruling apply to the modified measures, saying at least one of the parties must first file additional court papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of Maryland said it would join Monday the suit filed by the attorney general from Washington state, which also has the support of Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Oregon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'President Trump's second executive order is still a Muslim ban,' Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The administration persists in an effort to implement a policy that is inhumane and unconstitutional, but also makes us less safe, not more safe.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of Hawaii has filed a separate complaint, and a hearing in that case on whether to impose a national restraining order is set for March 15 as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House cites national security in justifying the ban, arguing that it needs time to implement 'extreme vetting' procedures to keep Islamic militants from entering the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show American public opinion is deeply divided on the issue. Most indicate a slight majority of voters opposed, with strong support among Trump's political base.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groundswell of anger created around the world by the actions of the US president is &quot;unprecedented&quot;, Greens leader Richard Di Natale told a few hundred protesters at an anti-Trump rally in Melbourne on Friday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many gathered outside the State Library in the city as a range of speakers including Di Natale addressed the crowd. They chanted &quot;Down Trump down!&quot; and &quot;No hate, no fear, Muslims are welcome here&quot;. Similar protests will follow in Canberra, Sydney, Newcastle and Hobart on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Melbourne protesters condemned both Donald Trump and the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for their respective countries' treatment of asylum seekers and refugees. They called on Turnbull to &quot;Bring them here&quot; before commencing a march through the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest was sparked by indications this week that Trump might not honour an agreement with the Obama administration to send 1,250 refugees from Australian-run detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru to the US for resettlement. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House gave reassurances earlier in the week that the deal would go ahead. However - after the Washington Post revealed a transcript of an explosive conversation between the US president and Malcolm Turnbull regarding the deal - Trump tweeted on Thursday that it was a &quot;dumb deal&quot;  and labelled those affected as &quot;illegal immigrants&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing uncertainty brought calls for the federal government to let them resettle in Australia to end the political back-and-forth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to Guardian Australia after addressing the crowd, Di Natale said: &quot;I think, like many Australians right now, people are feeling shocked and angry and they are realising the political establishment has let them down.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now's the time to make it very clear to all those people who are the target of Donald Trump's vile attack that we stand with them, because I think many of those people feel abandoned right now. They feel ignored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melbourne city was brought to a standstill at peak hour as people walked over tram lines and down main roads towards Flinders Street station. People finishing work in the city joined the crowd, which swelled as it passed through the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiffany Harkins, who moved to Melbourne a few months ago from New York, said she had come to the protest in a show of solidarity with refugees and asylum seekers, and also with her friends and family at home. &quot;With everything that's going on in the states we need to stand up and to show we love everyone and that you shouldn't promote fear-mongering or hatred to people of a certain religion, colour or class, just because certain things happened,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't normally protest, but I felt compelled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another protester, Headvig S&ouml;derhielm, attended with friends holding placards, one of which read: &quot;For those who've come across the seas we've boundless plains to share&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;When we are old, we don't want to say to ourselves that when all of this was going on, we stayed at home and did nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, despite US press secretary Sean Spicer's latest reassurances, more than 70 organisations called for the camps on Nauru and Manus Island to immediately close, with all refugees and asylum seekers brought to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charities, aid groups, unions and thinktanks urged immediate action to address what they called a &quot;humanitarian crisis&quot; as refugees spoke of the torment created by the uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint letter from the 70 organisations said: &quot;Beyond the reports of physical and sexual abuse, including of children; inadequate medical attention; suicides and attempted suicides; even a murder; the extinguishment of hope has pushed people to the edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of these people have been recognised as refugees. We owe them protection and safety now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the US resettlement deal in serious doubt, the most obvious and humane solution is to clear the camps and bring these people to Australia until a safe long-term, appropriate outcome for them can be guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil Glendenning, the president of the Refugee Council of Australia, used a Sydney media conference to note the country's history of leadership in accepting refugees. &quot;Forty years ago when Australia faced a serious crisis with regards to refugees, we had a prime minister named Malcolm - Malcolm Fraser - and a leader of the opposition named Bill - Bill Hayden. Together they formed a bipartisan partnership to bring refugees to this country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glendenning told Guardian Australia he worried that even if the US agreed to honour the deal, the policy of extreme vetting might mean it was worthless anyway. &quot;If extreme vetting means more cruelty, more waiting , more limbo, more uncertainty, then that's not tolerable,&quot; Glendenning said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing that worries me about President Trump is he's using extreme vetting as a way of doing what he really wants to do, and that's scupper the deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Ronalds, CEO of Save the Children, said in a statement: &quot;We know from our time providing services on Nauru that uncertainty and a lack of hope has a devastating impact on the health and wellbeing of refugees and asylum seekers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Australian government's focus on finding viable third-country options for resettlement have been welcome, but those attempts have not resulted in an outcome that ends the uncertainty and provides a safe and secure home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull maintained his composure on Friday as the fallout from his phone call with the president continued. Asked on 2SM Radio in Sydney if Trump was a brash character, Turnbull replied: &quot;I'll leave others to comment on him but  he's clearly a very big personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnbull again denied that Trump had hung up on him during the pair's 25-minute weekend phone call, saying it was a &quot;frank discussion&quot; that had ended &quot;courteously&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to smooth tensions are underway, with Joe Hockey, the Australian ambassador in Washington, called to the White House to meet Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and chief of staff, Reince Preibus, for what was described as a &quot;productive meeting&quot;. A White House spokesman said: &quot;They conveyed the president's deep admiration for the Australian people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Refugees on Nauru and Manus Island spoke of the torture of the ongoing uncertainty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man, who is on Nauru with his wife and young daughter, told Guardian Australia at the time the US refugee deal was revealed in November that it was the &quot;best news&quot; they had received after four years in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their time in Nauru included alleged assaults and an incident of alleged sexual assault against their daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family has already met US officials and were scheduled for a second meeting this month. That meeting has now been downgraded to a standing unscheduled request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, he told Guardian Australia, &quot;when they don't like us we don't like to go&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were happy - but not now,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody knows what is [Trump's] plan. We just want freedom from here and Trump has a plan after four months. Maybe after one or two years he'll tell us if he wants us or no. We all have stress about this and we are tired and sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian journalist detained on Manus Island, said the ongoing questions around the deal had been &quot;torturing people&quot;, and Trump's tweet left them sure that &quot;nothing will happen&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This policy has been defeated and it's time to solve the problem by taking people to Australia or to accept New Zealand's offer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRIENDS of 31-year-old Mohammed Abdurezek, who was found stabbed to death in South Gloucestershire, say he was close to getting refugee status when he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second appeal for information has been made by police after the body of the 31-year-old was found in undergrowth in the village of Siston by a dog walker on Christmas Eve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DCI James Riccio, who is leading the investigation for Avon and Somerset Police, said that they believed Mr Abdurezek was not killed where he was found and that a team of officers were &quot;working tirelessly&quot; on the murder investigation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was living in Swansea until three to four weeks ago when he returned to Bristol to search for his daughter from a previous relationships, investigating officers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean O'Donoghue, of Hay, Brecon and Talgarth Refugee Support Group, said that &quot;Mo&quot; came to Bristol from Ethiopia as a child stowaway around 2002, and became a man &quot;taken to heart&quot; by many in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mr Abdurezek's solicitor had just revealed that he could have embarked on his full application for refugee status after vital papers had arrived from the Home Office</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A talented athlete, he had completed the Cardiff Half Marathon in a time of 1.37, crossing the line with his arms crossed above his head in homage to the symbol of the Oromo people's quest for justice in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr O'Donoghue said the 31-year-old had fled from the east African country after he witnessed his father being beaten up by security forces, and had been living as an asylum seeker for the past 14 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;When I offered my condolences a few months back on the slaughter of up to a 100 of his people at a festival, he shrugged his shoulders and said that this kind of thing happens regularly but doesn't get reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wanted to go back home and help in the fight for justice and independence for his people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that being devastated &quot;understates&quot; the feeling he got when news reached him on Boxing Day that his friend had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talgarth county councillor William Powell said that during a respite day organised by Hay, Brecon and Talgarth City of Sanctuary back in July, Mr Abdurezek ended up playing for the opposing team during a football match because he was so keen to get on the pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mo was highly competitive in sport, and on that occasion, ran onto the pitch, so eager was he to join the action,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talgarth Town were happy to incorporate his talent into their side for the remainder of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mo's evident sporting talent, turbulent early life and proud identity with the struggle of his own people meant that he was taken to heart by some people in my community who got to know him during the respite visits that he took part in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The news of his violent death has caused genuine shock amongst those who knew him. I very much hope that Avon and Somerset Police will be successful in bringing to justice those responsible for his murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following new information, police have begun their searches at a property St George's House in Church Drive, St George, where it is believed that Mr Abdurezek had been living recently, with the searches expected to last for a few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DCI Riccio said: &quot;We're working with residents living in the premises and nearby to ensure any concerns they may have are addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the investigation is progressing, we still need more information from the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their appeal to the public, police have asked for anyone to come forward who might have heard a disturbance or witnessed an assault within the vicinity of St George's House between Tuesday, December 6 and Sunday, December 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have also asked for anyone who has seen any suspicious or unusual activity in that area, or if they know anything about where Mohammed was working during his time in Bristol to get in touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who could help with police inquiries are asked to call the Major Crime Investigation Team on 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5216284767 or use the inquiry name Operation Neptune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information can also be given anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or visit&nbsp;www.crimestoppers-uk.org</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohanned Jasim, 22, was born in Iraq and his family fled, first to Syria in 2005 when he was 11, then claimed asylum in Britain three years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was stopped at Dover with a Somali refugee, Mohamed Abdulkadir Osman Mayow, 23, a former Asda worker, also from Hayes, West London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayow, a Dutch national whose parents were Somali refugees, had moved to Britain to live with his family in 2014, but had already been radicalised in the Netherlands, the Old Bailey heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been fired from the supermarket after refusing to handle meat and alcohol, taking an hour and a half for prayers and demanding a six-week holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men were active on Twitter and on August 27 2014, Mayow had re-Tweeted a message from a user called @KifirsNightmare, saying: 'I can't wait for the day we fight the AmeriC***S on the ground and kill their mens, slave their womens, orphan their kids.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasim was jailed for two years for encouraging support for terrorism and Mayow was jailed for five years and two months for six counts of disseminating terrorist publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasim's father was attacked twice by militants in Iraq - once in a gun attack, and once by a car bomb - and two cousins were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They fled to Damascus, where they lived until he was aged 14, and were granted 'indefinite leave to remain' in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 2011 Jasim's father applied to the Home Office for a travel document for his son and was given one that allowed Jasim to travel to all countries except Iraq, for ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasim then applied for naturalisation as a British citizen on May 6 2015 but after waiting nearly four months, he asked the Home Office to return his papers, saying he wanted to return to Iraq on a one-way ticket to be with his sick step-mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead he was granted British citizenship on October 21 2015 and invited for an interview for a British passport which was issued on November 4, ten days before he set off for Holland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair were stopped at Dover on November 14 2015 on a Eurolines coach from Victoria to the Hague in the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge, Rebecca Poulet QC, said they were 'probably heading further East thereafter.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was carrying &pound;1,616.30 and a SIM belonging to Mayow which contained 12,000 images showing armed men in combat clothing firing weapons, people about to be maimed or beheaded and dead bodies, many of them relating to ISIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayow had sent out around 3,000 Tweets to 947 followers, at least 424 of which specifically referred to ISIS, between April 2104 and his arrest in November 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Examination of Mayow's electronic devices revealed he had told one contact on a website called AskFM that if he were Mayor of London, he would 'establish shariah [Islamic law] of course, like shariah police etc, let the kuffar [non-believers] pay jizyah [tax].'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 5 2015, he sent out a link to a message from a Canadian ISIS fighter called Abu Anwar al-Canadi who said: 'You either purchase your airline ticket or sharpen your knife, you either come to the Islamic State and live under the laws of Allah or you follow the example of Ahmad Rouleau and do not fear the blame of the blamers.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rouleau had driven his car into two Canadian soldiers, killing one, telling police he did it in the name of Allah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 18 2015, Jasim messaged Mayow on Whatsapp, telling him: 'When i go out, i see these kuffar [non-believers] and i hate it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He asked Mayow if he was planning to leave 'dar alkuffar' [land of disbelief] and said the oath required to take citizenship was a 'clear kufr' [sin].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 7 2015, Jasim told Mayow on an application called Viber that he was 'thinking of how to go without my parents' awareness.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was thinking about next Friday and Mayow said he would 'do my best.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his arrest, Jasim was asked why had had applied for a British passport, and told police it was 'easier to travel to places, for example like Saudi Arabia.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he had any strong feelings about living in Britain, he said he would prefer to live closer to the Holy City of Mecca, adding 'any Muslim would.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayow said he was proud to be Dutch and that it was 'nicer there.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, after pleading guilty, Jasim wrote to the judge recognising his 'debt to Great Britain' who accepted him as a citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge told Mayow he was seeking to recruit for ISIS and added: 'You used social media as a conduit to reach others and did so for over a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The fact is, you chose to Tweet extensively, both video and other material, the most precious publicity for ISIS.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had since written a letter to her, describing ISIS as a 'horrible and vicious group' and agreeing to go on a de-radicalisation course.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadia was six weeks pregnant and homeless when she made contact with a refugee charity in Glasgow. &quot;I was so depressed when I found out I was pregnant,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn't know what I was going to eat today or tomorrow. I didn't know where I was going to live. I didn't have any money and didn't want my child to have to live like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadia's claim for refugee protection had been refused and, living in the &quot; hostile environment &quot; Theresa May has created for illegal immigrants, she was excluded from any UK asylum support, including emergency housing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Scottish Refugee Council we see people like Nadia every day - men and women living in absolute poverty as a direct result of UK government policy. The number of people in this position is increasing[pdf] and that includes individuals with physical and mental health difficulties, and women, like Nadia, who are pregnant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  How we launched a refugee centre from scratch in 96 hours</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Destitution can occur at several points in the asylum process but forced, state-sanctioned absolute poverty most frequently occurs when people's claims for refugee protection have been refused. The Home Office believes, against the evidence[pdf], that people will return to war zones and countries where they have been tortured and persecuted if they are denied food and shelter in the UK. It is an attempt to starve people out of the country. But it doesn't work. People will try to survive in any way they can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know that this policy forces people into dangerous and exploitative situations, including domestic servitude, prostitution and abusive relationships, just to find shelter for the night. We know too the detrimental impact that destitution has on people's mental and physical health, and the ways in which it impedes their ability to make decisions about the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This policy forces people into dangerous situations, such as prostitution, just to find shelter for the night</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When people don't have their basic needs met their thoughts and behaviour become chaotic,&quot; says Lindsay Reid, a caseworker at Scottish Refugee Council. &quot;This leads to feelings of shame and worthlessness which multiply and become entrenched over time. One man I know survived torture in Pakistan but through his experience of destitution in the UK has developed severe psychological problems and has lost the ability to cope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When people in need have no recourse to public funds it is left to the voluntary sector to plug the gaps. But this revolving door of emergency response cannot stop the cycle of suffering and degradation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need a new approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Scotland, where health, housing and social care are devolved, we need to see a coordinated, national approach to mitigate the harm caused by the Home Office's policy of forced destitution. Crucially, this must ensure that people's needs are assessed using a rights-based approach that protects their human rights to shelter and dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voluntary sector can't do this alone. The state has a responsibility to protect people from absolute poverty. Working together would go a long way to preventing the continued suffering of people at risk of being made destitute, not to mention costly interventions when those rendered destitute hit crisis points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Migrant crisis: charities have filled the gaps left by politicians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denying people their right to shelter and dignity is designed to make people feel worthless. We need to design a response that restores dignity and humanity - to our society as well as the individuals affected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hannah Ellis-Petersen</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD NEWS; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">678 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Game of Thrones actor Lena Headey, who is starring in one of the first British films to grapple with the refugee crisis, has spoken out against the &quot;horrendous and dehumanising&quot; way that people seeking safety in the UK are treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Flood sees Headey play British immigration officer Wendy, who is presiding over the fate of Eritrean refugee Haile, whose journey escaping from the war-torn African country to the Calais camp and eventually to England is traced in the film.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headey, best known as Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones, said having been put in the shoes of an immigration officer and exposed to a script based on real-life accounts from people working for the Home Office had affirmed her belief that a shift in attitude was needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand there are safety issues, and screenings for security, but it could be so much more human and compassionate,&quot; said Heady. &quot;It's horrendous that after the journeys that these refugees go through, they are then treated immediately with suspicion and fear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I get it, this is a crisis with so many levels, but we have also lost sight of the fact it's not a 'problem', it's people, it's other human beings. And we're dehumanising them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there have been several critically acclaimed documentaries that have followed the plights of the hundreds of thousands fleeing the Middle East and Africa, barely any feature films on the issue have made it into production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headey said she noted how in the wake of events such as Brexit, conversations about the refugee crisis had begun to dwindle, and said that had been a motivating factor in her getting involved in the film. Written by Helen Kingston, the film was initially inspired by an incident in which 35 immigrants from Afghanistan were discovered in a shipping container at Tilbury Docks in Essex in 2014, with some dying during the ordeal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The power of film to change people's minds is a real thing,&quot; she said. &quot; I, Daniel Blake was a really good example of this, it woke people up - it woke me up - to the injustice of something that is happening now, right under our noses. This film is about the horrors of what is happening every day to the refugees coming to Europe, and how appalling and frightening it is to sit by while it goes on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;I hope it will provoke similar kinds of conversations. It's amazing how quickly it seems to have died down even though it's as a bad as it ever was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headey said she fully understood people's fatigue having been bombarded with images of violence and human suffering every day, but said she believed the most important task was to make people less fearful of the refugees and their motives for coming to the UK. Having visited Greece last year to meet some of those who had made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, Headey said she had been struck by how the main message the women wanted to convey was that &quot;we are not terrorists&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet she also noted what she described as a &quot;massive discontentment&quot; among the men living in the makeshift camp on the island of Lesbos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we don't have a shift where we recognise these people for who they were before they were forced to leave their countries - people who are educated with family values, who had careers and homes - then we are going to be in trouble, we really are. We are going to grow an absolute fury, you could feel it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the next season of Game of Thrones premiering in July keeping Headey firmly in the limelight, she said she had come to accept that publicly speaking out about the refugee crisis would prompt a backlash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People look at actors who speak out and say 'oh well, it's so easy for them',&quot; she said. &quot;There are a lot of people who are saying 'it's all right for you, you champagne socialist' but that's fucking bollocks, I'm just a human being with a conscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My kids need to know that I gave a shit - that's what drives me most,&quot; Headey added. &quot;I'm a jobbing actor, this is what I do to make cash, but sometimes I do projects where I make no cash because it's about making something that will hopefully get people talking.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O ne of the topics I get lots of letters about is Britain's commitment to spending on international aid.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many correspondents see our commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on aid as wrong when there are so many needs at home. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless I believe that it is right.   Recent crises show why aid is so important for us in the UK, as well as desperately needed by some of the poorest people in the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it is helping to prevent deadly diseases like Ebola from coming to the UK from West Africa, or helping to support the millions of Syrian refugees who have taken shelter in Jordan and Lebanon, our aid money tackles the root causes of global problems that affect all of us. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last five years, UK aid has been life-saving and life-changing for millions of desperately poor people around the world. Our aid has supported 11 million children through school and helped more than 60 million people get access to clean water, better sanitation and improved hygiene conditions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When David Cameron took over we stopped giving aid to countries who frankly did not need financial support from Britain, such as China, and in 2015 we ended our traditional aid programme in India. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only are we spending more on aid than we did in the past, we are also targeting that money better, helping it improve the lives of even greater numbers of people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We committed to spending 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on aid back when I was an opposition international development spokesman, and introduced it as a policy when we took power in the coalition government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were the first G7 country to meet this international spending target and the first to enshrine it in law, in 2015. Just 7p out of every &pound;10 of taxpayers' money is excellent value for the sort of results our aid spending produces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was in Lebanon last year and found out about what our Department for International Development and its local aid partners are doing for Syrian refugees there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This work is critical - not just because it is right in itself to help desperate, destitute people but also because, having well-supported refugee camps in the Middle East saves refugees from having to make the dangerous journey to Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also will make it easier for them to one day return to their homes and rebuild their lives. Through aid we can save literally dozens of lives for the cost of bringing one refugee into Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One regret I do have about the bill we passed back in 2015 is that it used a 40-year-old definition of international aid, which excludes support for important endeavours such as security. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lebanon, I saw the border posts we have paid to erect to help keep out Syrian Daesh terrorists. If the war in Iraq and Syria were to spill over into Lebanon, this would add a new, destabilising, dimension to the humanitarian crisis there, jeopardising all the excellent work our aid teams have done. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite that one regret, I am proud of what we are achieving - even though we do have more to do at home. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen-year-old Dhakhil had been so badly injured at an Iraqi refugee camp that physicians thought his leg would need to be amputated. But thanks to a team of surgeons in Boston, the Yazidi teenager will be able to walk again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation to repair Dhakhil's badly shattered leg nearly didn't happen because of Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He arrived 48 hours before the ban,&quot; Carrie Schuchardt, Dhakhil's caretaker in the US, told the Guardian. &quot;And we know if he had come to [Boston's] Logan airport on the Friday instead of the Wednesday, there is a good chance he would have been turned away. He would have lost his leg, possibly his life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 27 January, Trump banned refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US. People who were banned from entering the US included dozens of patients who had been screened and were set to receive urgent medical care at the country's top hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House didn't show the federal agencies that oversee immigration the order before it was signed into law, causing chaos at airports around the world. The order was temporarily stayed the next night, but confusion lingered until an appellate court blocked enforcement of the order last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That court's decision may have saved lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the travel ban was halted, the Cleveland Clinic said it had nine patients scheduled to travel from the affected countries to the US for medical care, while Johns Hopkins had at least 11 patients scheduled to receive treatment who were affected by the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are very, very ill patients,&quot; Pamela Paulk, president of Johns Hopkins Medicine International, told STAT, a US health news website. &quot;In most cases, these are not cases to be postponed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the Mayo Clinic medical facility said: &quot;We have several patients who would have needed to cancel or delay their appointments at Mayo Clinic if the order had not been challenged by the courts.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayo Clinic said that it also knew of 80 staff, physicians and scholars affiliated with the medical system who were affected by the order. &quot;We have brought expertise from legal, government relations and human resources to help with individual cases as needed,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospitals would not disclose the status of the patients on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is, in part, because of the uncertainty about the White House's next move on immigration. The administration supports strict immigration policies and has said it will challenge the court order blocking its travel ban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Thousands of refugees could be barred from US despite ruling on travel ban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said the administration was &quot;reviewing all of our options in the court system&quot; to win the legal battle and Trump said he was considering a &quot;brand-new&quot; executive order on immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's sweeping travel ban included members of the Yazidi religious minority in Iraq, who were subjected to what the United Nations classified as genocide when Isis militants overran their homes in northern Iraq in the summer of 2014, killing and enslaving thousands of women and girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Yazidis, like Dhakhil, still live in refugee camps, where there is rarely electricity, limiting access to surgical care. The limited resources in the camps can make it difficult to adequately treat everything from broken bones to chronic conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American hospitals have helped these refugees and countless others abroad who have limited access to high-quality medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schuchardt, who with her husband, John, has housed hundreds of refugees in Massachusetts at the House of Peace, is alarmed by the prospect of a new immigration executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past ten years, most of the refugees housed at House of Peace have been children from war zones in the Middle East who are scheduled to receive medical treatment in Boston hospitals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House of Peace has welcomed children who lost limbs in car bombings, incurred serious burns in other explosions and suffered depleted uranium poisoning in Fallujah. The children often have to return to the US multiple times for follow-up burn treatment or to get new prosthetics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schuchardt said the children return to refugee camps or towns in war zones with a message: &quot;In America, there is healing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because of the uncertainty about the administration's immigration policy plans, staff at House of Peace are worried about two young girls from Iraq and Syria who travelled to Massachusetts for burn treatment last year and will need to return for further care. &quot;We're deeply concerned that they won't be allowed back in,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schuchardt hopes the messages resonated at a meeting with congressional staffers on  Tuesday afternoon in Washington DC . She spoke at the briefing, which was sponsored by Senator Richard Blumenthal and hosted by Amnesty International, Church World Service and Human Rights First to show the impact of the travel ban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schuchardt was encouraged by travel ban protests and thought it was possible that citizens' concern about other people's suffering could &quot;overcome what is coming out of Washington at this point&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really feel a surge of conscience in this country that we haven't experienced in a very long time,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Travel ban shuts out Yazidis despite their suffering at the hands of Isis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week, House of Peace will welcome a Yazidi boy, Dilbreen. He has been in the US without his family for months after receiving treatment for burns he suffered after a heater exploded in the Iraqi refugee camp where he was staying.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father traveled to the US for his son's first round of treatment - when Schuchardt met the family - but had to return to Iraq for the birth of Dilbreen's brother, who was named Trump in honor of his election night birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dilbreen stayed with a Yazidi community in Michigan while waiting for his next treatment at Shriner's Hospital in Boston, but his parents were prevented from entering the country and doctors had to postpone a critical eye surgery because they could not enter. &quot;They were suffering enormous grief that they would not see Dilbreen again,&quot; Schuchardt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last week, after sustained protest and the courts' intervention, the family was called to the American consulate, where they all received visas, even the new baby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are set to travel to Boston next week. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is shameful that Theresa May has decided to renege the Government's promise to bring the most vulnerable refugee children to safety in the UK. That the announcement was sneaked out by the Tories just before recess, is an absolute disgrace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK has taken just 350 lone child refugees which is nowhere near the 3000 originally proposed by Lord Dubs and is fewer than one per local authority in the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any claim by the Prime Minister to be a compassionate Conservative is utterly undermined by the dereliction of duty to some of the most vulnerable people in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government should have been doing far more to support local authorities in helping provide the support and safety child refugees need so desperately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only this week, a report by the counter extremism organisation Quilliam revealed how thousands of vulnerable child refugees, abandoned by countries like the UK, are being left vulnerable to sexual and financial exploitation by human traffickers and radicalisation by groups like Isis who are seeking to capitalise on Europe's wavering response to the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens UK is a charity that witnesses first-hand the horrifying daily risks these children faced in Calais and just how desperate for safety they were. This is a national scandal, which disgraces us all. The Government should hang its head in shame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain has a proud tradition of welcoming those most in need. We stepped up to rescue 10,000 Jewish children from Nazi persecution. One of those children was Lord Dubs, who arrived in the UK as a child refugee on the kindertransport. Which is why I am joining Citizens UK and calling for the Prime Minister to stand by the country's values, reverse her decision and keep Lord Dubs' scheme alive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goingagainst the tide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In your otherwise excellent editorial today (Green energy is evolving, so why aren't the attitudes of ministers?), you, sadly, failed to mention tidal power as a source of renewable energy. This is of great interest here in Swansea, where the local imaginative project seems about to become reality after a good deal of delay at government level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a genuinely long term project which, with other strategic examples, will produce up to 8 per cent of our needs on a fully predictable basis. Yes, it will need maintenance and eventual replacement of working parts, but this can be done in a piecemeal fashion from land based foundations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the time for division</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 4 February, over 40,000 people marched in central London against Donald Trump's 'Muslim Ban'. This was the first of such demonstrations that was led and called by British Muslim organisations and institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As British Muslims, we are outraged at Donald Trump's attempt to ban people from seven predominately Muslim countries entering the USA. Although the international protest movement won a victory on Saturday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">morning when the US appeal court refused to reinstate the ban, this is not the end to the Trump administration's Islamophobic rhetoric and policies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration was organised by the Muslim Council of Britain, Muslim Association of Britain, Muslim Engagement and Development (MEND) in partnership with the Stop the War Coalition, Stand up to Racism, the People's Assembly Against Austerity; and supported by Friends of Al-Aqsa and CND.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are disappointed that Owen Jones announced on social media that he would not attend our demonstration because of Stand Up To Racism's perceived connection to the Socialist Workers Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe this was divisive. Stand Up To Racism involves many in its leading bodies including Diane Abbott MP, Kate Osamor MP, CWU General Secretary Dave Ward, NUT General Secretary Kevin Courtney, Rabbi Lee Wax, Talha Ahmad from the Muslim Council of Britain, amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Muslims need support at this important time from organisations opposed to Islamophobia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a British citizen now living in the USA, I have been following the Brexit issue with great interest and some alarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is interesting to note, that while there was a majority amongst those that actually voted, it was in fact a narrow majority, yet it would appear from the behaviour of MPs and the Government that it was in fact won with a huge majority. Closely held principles and the voting decisions of their constituencies didn't seem to matter at all when the time came for MPs to cast their own vote in Parliament, they simply capitulated to the instructions of their whips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also interesting to me that while there is a certain amount of smug disdain and criticism in the UK about the results of the election over here, the drivers for Brexit seem to be almost the same. These include; a fear of immigrants and people not like us, a desire to make Great Britain great again, and a move away from knowledge and facts to emotion and &quot;alternative facts&quot; as a means of making decisions about the future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What exactly does he expect us to do when he and Theresa May are hell bent on ignoring anyone who disagrees with the extreme course of action they have embarked upon with a mandate of only 37 per cent of voters? Shame on the House for not even providing some certainty for the millions of EU citizens living on this country. This is not the will of the people.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers decided cap the number of orphaned Syrian children coming to the UK at 350 to stop fuelling people trafficking routes.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the so-called Dubs amendment that opened Britain's doors to unaccompanied Syrian children was acting as a pull factor for an increasing number of children trying to reach Europe, which exposed them to traffickers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's decision to close the scheme caused uproar, and today the Archbishop of Canterbury said he was 'saddened and shocked' at the decision.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the growing chorus of protest, Theresa May stood by the decision, insisting the Dubs route was only one of a number of routes by which Britain was resettling vulnerable children, adding that the Government's approach towards refugees is 'absolutely right'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was expected the Dubs scheme would resettle up to 3,000 people in the UK but the Government announced that just over 10 per cent of that figure will be taken in.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hundred children have been brought in under the scheme but it will close after another 150 are settled in the UK, it was announced.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cash-strapped councils had told the Government they lacked the resources to take in more child refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Rudd suggested local authority funding had to be considered in deciding how many child refugees could be settled&nbsp;under the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending the decision after an urgent question was called in the House of Commons today, Ms Rudd insisted:&nbsp;'I am clear that when working with my French counterparts, they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs Amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw. It acts as a pull.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It encourages the people-traffickers.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking at&nbsp;a press conference in Downing Street following talks with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Mrs May said the Dubs scheme was only one of a number of routes by which vulnerable children from war-torn Syria can find sanctuary in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister said: 'We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right, on top of course of the significant financial support and humanitarian aid we are giving to refugees in the region of Syria - a commitment of &pound;2.3 billion, the second biggest bilateral donor.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Archbishop Justin Welby reacted furiously to the decision to end the Dubs amendment scheme.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a lengthy statement today, h said he had believed ministers were 'committed to welcoming up to 3,000 children under this scheme' and it is 'regrettable' such a small proportion have been given sanctuary in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His intervention piles further pressure on the Government, which has been heavily criticised by Lords and MPs in Parliament after it quietly announced the cap of lone child refugees being brought to Britain.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Welby said: 'I was saddened and shocked to read in the ministerial statement released yesterday that only 350 children will be received under the regulations in the Dubs amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Our country has a great history of welcoming those in need, particularly the most vulnerable, such as unaccompanied children. '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said refugees 'are treasured human beings' who 'deserve safety, freedom and the opportunity to flourish', and he hopes the Government will reconsider the decision.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were angry scenes in the Lords when Home Office minister Baroness Williams of Trafford denied the scheme had been closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour's Lord Dubs, who spearheaded the amendment, said he was puzzled by the claim and accused ministers of breaching their own commitments by 'arbitrarily closing down' the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory Lord Cormack said concern over the Government's stance was not confined to the Labour and Liberal Democrat benches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal Democrat Baroness Sheehan said it was 'palpably faulty' to suggest local authorities had reached the 'end of the road' with the scheme and accused the Government of being 'disinterested in taking any more'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lady Williams said this was 'absolutely wrong' and urged local authorities or community groups willing to help to contact the Home Office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">580 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland has won a justifiable reputation for generosity towards asylum seekers. It was the first to offer housing for refugees fleeing Syria and has taken in 3,000 already, with offers to take many more. That offer is now on hold, but not necessarily because of any reluctance on the part of those councils across the country that have expressed a willingness to help. Most of them have indicated that they are ready in principle to accept those fleeing from war, persecution and the destruction of their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office has identified 28 of the 32 Scottish local authorities as being potentially suitable. It is one thing for councils to be identified as potential sanctuaries; quite another for them to find the resources to fund the housing and maintenance of those who come. Glasgow, which has been in the vanguard of providing accommodation in the past, is all too aware that simply making premises available is only part of the solution. Putting families in high-rise flats, out of sight and out of mind, is no way to treat refugees who have escaped extreme privation and suffering and who deserve the opportunity of integrating into a new society. They need back-up from social services, access to heath provision and education, legal advice and above all a community that is ready to welcome them. All that takes time and money.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Scottish councils have learnt - notably North Ayrshire, which is the first outside Glasgow to offer help - is that the Home Office request for assistance does not come with any offer of funding attached. No indication has been given from Whitehall that resources will be made available - on the contrary it seems that none will be forthcoming. Not surprisingly, North Ayrshire has pointed out that given the pressure on its budget it does not feel able yet to participate in the scheme. This does not sound like parsimony - it is realistic. The worst possible outcome would be for refugees to find themselves in some bleak housing block, short of funds, in conditions that offer not much improvement on the place from which they fled. As the Scottish Refugee Council puts it: &quot;These are people who have fled unimaginable horrors and are entitled to quality support in the crucial early days and weeks after their arrival.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Home Office does want to see a more even spread of refugees around the country, and it is right to do so, then it needs to consider the cost of what it is asking. It must know that the councils it is relying on are grappling with cuts amounting to many millions of pounds. To ask that on top of this they should be housing refugees who would inevitably siphon funds from existing projects would be to exacerbate local resentment - the worst possible atmosphere for new arrivals looking to begin a new life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosla, which has been negotiating with the Home Office on behalf of the councils, will not be expecting to receive 100 per cent of the costs, but it is right to ask for assistance both in resources and in advice. The Scottish government too should be offering support, and the councils themselves, hard-pressed as they are, should accept the reality that compared with the streets of Aleppo or the refugee camps of Jordan they are well provided for. The quality of mercy is not strained, but it does need genuine sacrifice if it is to be delivered, and that sacrifice should come from governments on both sides of the border as well as the local councils that will be in the front line of support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE than half of failed asylum seekers are being allowed to stay in Europe indefinitely because of the continent's shambolic border controls, it emerged today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri admitted most failed asylum seekers are not deported</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just 42 per cent of economic migrants are being kicked out of EU member states even though authorities have determined they have no legal right to be there.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eurocrats tried to heap blame on the Greek border guards for the mess, saying they are being too slow to return failed asylum seekers to Turkey.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  'Situation could WORSEN in 2017' says refugee-hit Hungary  Migrant gang turns Malmo into 'war zone' during NYE celebrations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics are likely to point to the figures as an example of how the whole EU migration system is broken, while failing to tackle economic migration also erodes public confidence to the detriment of genuine refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shock statistics, revealed by the head of the Brussels border force, will also make uncomfortable reading for Angela Merkel, who today came under pressure to introduce a migration cap in Germany.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greece has been blamed for overseeing a slow rate of returns to Turkey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics say the failure to tackle economic migration undermines public confidence in real refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri said he expected Greek officials to oversee a rate of return of 500 economic migrants a day to neighbouring Turkey, but that they were falling way short of that number.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, a paltry 748 migrants have been returned across the Aegean sea since the deal came into force last March, while the EU has taken in 2,761 Syrian refugees from Turkey during the same period.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a landmark agreement between Brussels and Ankara, sealed last summer, all migrants who make the sea crossing to Greece are sent back, with Europe taking in one genuine refugee from a camp in Turkey for every failed asylum seeker returned.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pact, which has come under pressure from the increasingly combative Turkish president Recep Erdogan, has been hailed by Mrs Merkel for reducing the once steady flow of asylum seekers using the Balkan route north to a trickle.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separate figures released by the European Commission last month show the EU's internal quota system is also in chaos, with just five per cent of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece who are earmarked for relocation having been moved.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of eastern European states including Hungary are furiously resisting the imposition of an EU-wide quota system for migrants, claiming that it impacts unreasonably on their sovereignty.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelations come after Mrs Merkel faced enormous pressure to introduce a migrant cap for Germany as her controversial open door asylum policy continues to fall apart amid widespread political opposition,&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another hammer blow to her reputation the leader of the Christian Social Union , which is sister party to the Chancellor's ruling Christian Democratic Union , said the number of refugees taken in by Germany should be capped at 200,000 a year.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments by Horst Seehofer come after Germany has been rocked by a series of terror and sex attacks committed by recently arrived refugees, placing Mrs Merkel's border policies firmly under the spotlight.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany has taken in more than a million new arrivals in the latest 18 months, with the number made up both of genuine refugees fleeing war and persecution and economic migrants looking for a better life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Britain's upcoming exit from the EU, the so-called Brexit, the so far futile search for a common European response to the refugee crisis, as well as the continual, unsuccessful violations of the European Stability and Growth Pact, are probably the biggest challenges the EU is facing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edmund Stoiber ruled Bavaria until 2007</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no firm statistics on the number of Syrians there, he said, but he believes the figure is close to 1000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is not just Ghana. Fleeing Syrians have found refuge in pockets across sub-Saharan Africa, even as far as South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 300 are in Somalia's relatively peaceful breakaway northern territory of Somaliland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to the millions living in camps in Syria's overwhelmed neighbours, the Syrians find themselves relatively free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what makes Ghana different is the fact that we have a very generous asylum policy,&quot; said Tetteh Padi, programme co-ordinator for the Ghana Refugee Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are free to move about. They can go out, look for work. I know for a fact that is not the case in other countries. In some countries, refugees are not even allowed to leave the refugee camps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 130 Syrians so far have been granted refugee status, Padi said, and other requests for asylum are being considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's government has not provided food or lodging assistance so far but provides help where it can, Padi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state is providing them with security, the state is protecting them. We're issuing them with documentation, which is very critical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This country now feels like a second home for Bandenjki, and he calls Ghana beautiful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he wishes more could be done to help others fleeing Syria's devastation. Many refugees are far worse off financially than he is, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of support and work opportunities in Ghana, plus the high cost of living, drives many Syrians to pursue a move to developed countries in North America or Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ghana is not really ready to host refugees,&quot; Bandenjki said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his 17-year-old son, Mohammed, has adapted quickly to life there and is studying hard at school. He managed to learn English in about five months, the teenager said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of his family's fate, Bandenjki said simply: &quot;We are patient until God finds us a solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will never be near one but it's easy for them to stand on a stage and talk about [the issue],&quot; she added. &quot;That's incredibly frustrating to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California is home to several sanctuary cities that grant certain rights to undocumented migrants and which are at risk of losing federal funding after Mr Trump's election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Blaze</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that it should be &quot;America first&quot;, a phrase used by President Trump at his Inauguration ceremony, and he added that a conversation about military veterans should not include a discussion about refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Lahren's Facebook video, which has been seen more than 700,000 times, follows a series of executive orders signed by the President, which ban immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries and aimto crack down on illegal immigrants, drug cartels and violent crime - despite data showing that violent crime is on the decline over the last few decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They [transnational criminal organisations] have been known to commit brutal murders, rapes, and other barbaric acts,&quot;one of the orders read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President has also signed an order to publish a weekly list of &quot;criminal actions committed by aliens&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Jeff Sessions also accused &quot;lawlessness&quot; for brining in immigrants who &quot;affect the safety of Americans and pull down wages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump promises action 'very rapidly' after travel ban halted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar language is often applied to immigrants and refugees by right-wing commentators to stoke fear. Incidents such as the death of Kathryn Steinle, who authorities say was killedby a Mexican immigrant who had been deported five times, were usedby Mr Trump on the campaign trail as a way to demonise millions of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is scarcedata to suggest that immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, commit a higher proportion of crime than native-born US citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2010 census and an American Communities Survey led the non-profit American Immigration Council to discover that immigrants to the US were significantly less likely than native-born citizens to be imprisoned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look at Europe, look at the example they have provided for us,&quot; said Ms Lahren in the video. &quot;Look what happens, when you welcome Tom, Dick, Harry and Mohammed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May didn't condemn Donald Trump's refugee ban at first because she'd been &quot;in meetings all day&quot;, her office has claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embarrassing excuse suggests Theresa May hadn't even read the full ban on Muslim nations and refugees when she was heckled at a crunch press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of protesters will descend on Downing Street tonight as anger mounts at the President's order to stop all refugees entering the US for 120 days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order also bans Syrian refugees indefinitely and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries - Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a million people have signed a petition calling on the Prime Minister to cancel Trump's state visit to Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition to stop Donald Trump's British state visit hits 1MILLION signatures - yet No10 signals it'll go ahead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet despite Trump's order being signed on Friday, Mrs May ignored it repeatedly at a Saturday press conference with the Turkish PM - even though he condemned Trump for &quot;putting up walls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After she was heckled by journalists she said: &quot;The United States is responsible for the United States policy on refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downing Street finally criticised the policy later on Saturday night, saying: &quot;We do not agree with this kind of approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why the PM had not commented, a Downing Street spokesman told journalists today: &quot;The Prime Minister had been in meetings all day Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She wanted to see obviously what the details were around what had been announced and what the implications of that were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Prime Minister, as we've pointed out before, takes her time to work through the briefing material to understand an issue before she would comment on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a bit like one of my favourite bugbears, sitting in this room, is when you lot sit on your phones and say 'oh look, this is on Twitter now'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You need to see things in full context before you fully comment on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to confirm the PM &quot;hadn't been properly briefed&quot;, the spokesman said: &quot;I didn't say that at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The No10 spokesman said today of Trump's travel ban: &quot;We disagree with these restrictions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But under repeated questioning he refused to go further and stressed: &quot;The UK and the US have a very strong and close relationship and it's right that we continue to work together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The No10 spokesman declined to say if the Prime Minister was looking forward to the state visit by Donald Trump - or if she regretted setting it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also declined to answer whether Theresa May was concerned the travel ban would encourage other nations to shut their doors, if she cared 1million people had signed a petition to ban Trump from Britain, or if she had sympathy with protesters' concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why Britain opposed the US travel ban he said: &quot;We don't have this policy, it's not the way we would do it. US immigration policy is a matter for the US in the same way UK immigration is a matter for the UK government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioned on the Foreign Office insistence that UK dual nationals would be able to enter the US he said: &quot;We are confident those criteria will be applied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But confronted with a newly-issued page on the US Embassy website that implied dual nationals WILL be barred, he said: &quot;I haven't seen that so it's impossible we would comment on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We sought clarification yesterday and got that clarification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would have to go away and look at that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Government source said that after seeing the US Embassy guidance, Mr Johnson &quot;sought clarity from the White House and was informed that the FCO statement was correct&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by independent German news magazine Der Spiegel website on 31 December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Interview with Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, by Markus Dettmer and Christoph Schult; place and date not given: &quot;The Open Door Policy Was Wrong&quot; -- first paragraph is Der Spiegel introduction.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz (30) criticizes German Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policy and says he is ready to relax the sanctions against Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] Mr. Kurz, following the terrorist attack in Berlin, CSU [Christian Social Union] leader Horst Seehofer called for &quot;the reassessment and readjustment of immigration and security policy as a whole.&quot; Do you share this opinion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] First of all, we must commemorate the victims and provide their relatives provided with the best possible support. Then, we must address the question of how to guarantee maximum security in future. I choose to say &quot;maximum&quot; because absolute security will never exist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] So is Seehofer right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] I will not interfere in a domestic German debate. However, I can tell you my position: We must fight this new form of threat. Moreover, it would be wrong to talk only about terrorism. Political Islamism is its underlying basis. It is important to avoid talking down the problem, but call a spade a spade. The fight against radicalization will be one of my main priorities as OSCE chair because no one is spared. For example, we need to fight the financing of Islamists as well as the organizers behind Salafist Koran distribution drives. This is an attempt to construct a counter society that rejects and fights the way we live in Europe, ultimately via terrorism too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] Would it help to have an upper limit on the number of refugee arrivals like the one you have already introduced in Austria?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] The first and foremost objective is to secure the European Union's external borders. Without any control over who enters the EU and who lives here, there is a security risk. It would be fatal to equate refugees with terrorism. Yet on the other hand, it would be a huge mistake to believe that just because someone arrives here as a refugee, we can rest assured that he will never become a criminal or a terrorist. A year and a half ago, I already warned that the refugee routes could be used by terrorists as well. Unfortunately, that has proved to be the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] It was your government that together with German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the Austrian and German borders to tens of thousands of refugees from Hungary in the first weekend of September 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] My position has always been clear. I thought that this open door policy was wrong. Moreover, I was one of the few government members who did not go to the Vienna's Westbahnhof [railway station] to welcome the refugees. This earned me sharp criticism, but I was convinced that waving the refugees through would mean the problems grew rather than diminished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] Did you even put your doubts on record during talks with the German government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] I was always of this opinion. I was also one of the first to call for border controls and quicker processing back in August 2015. It is true that I was unable to command majority support with my position at the time, even within my own party -- the OeVP [Austrian People's Party]. Back then, the policy was very much driven by the media and non-governmental organizations, but also by many people's wish to do the right thing. The closure of the Western Balkan route, which we organized here from Vienna, was still much maligned a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] You mean by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said that the closure of the Balkan route did not solve the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] I was criticized by government colleagues at the time; I do not want to even think about Germany and Brussels. Now, I am hearing almost only agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] Did Mrs. Merkel ever thank you for closing the Balkan route?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] Gratitude is not important. The key is to take the right path now because there is still much to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] How do you want to secure the EU's external borders in future?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] We often talk just about border protection, but another question must be addressed: do we want to receive [refugees] in Europe at all? Indeed, our problem is that we attract people. Not only are we neglecting border protection, we are not doing anything against the pull effect that we exert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] Does that not create an illusion of security? For as long as the difference is so great -- economically as well as socially -- there will be attempts to come to Europe via people smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] We should distinguish between those who manage to arrive in Central Europe via smugglers and the 15,000 people who were arriving here each day at peak times in 2015. It is a question of whether we support a system where an ever-increasing number of people are setting out to reach us and ultimately, we even pay for the trains and the ferries to bring people to us quicker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] What do you suggest?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] We need a completely new asylum system in Europe. On the one hand, we can no longer accept as many people as we have in the past two years. On the other, in future we should choose who could come to Europe by legal means directly in the war zones. Conversely, it must be ensured that those who arrive in Europe illegally will be stopped at the external borders, processed, and taken back [to their home country] just like Australia and Spain do with success. Furthermore, if this were impossible, then they would be taken to another safe place outside Europe. There they would benefit from protection, but not from the better life that [they] had hoped for in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] Do you want to abolish the right to asylum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] No, but in the past two years, there were comparatively few people among the refugees who suffering from political persecution. The problem we are currently facing is that people from war-torn areas are not seeking protection in neighbouring countries, but deciding to come to Germany, Austria, or Sweden. In 2015, our neighbour Slovenia received fewer than 1,000 asylum applications compared to 90,000 here. Therefore, we cannot keep a system where one can choose in which European country one wants to claim asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] How should we deal with countries, particularly those in North Africa -- that refuse to accept their citizens [whose right to asylum is] rejected by Europe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] We must be more proactive. Many countries have no interest in us sending back their citizens. They are an economic factor. The money they send back home is an important revenue source. Therefore, the EU must be prepared to act according to the &quot;less for less principle.&quot; That is to say: countries that are not prepared to take back their citizens must accept a reduction to development cooperation aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] Are you not thus creating a vicious circle? If you cut development aid, you are making conditions in those countries worse and this in turn would mean more refugees leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] I see things differently. The mere threat [of reducing aid] would lead to a massive rethink. What is to say that these countries would unwilling to take action? We have not even tried it yet! Unless we defend our interests, we should not be surprised that our negotiating partners refuse to take back their own citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] Protection of external borders, aid closer to home -- these exact same demands are part of the refugee agreement with Turkey. Why did you criticize Merkel's deal with Ankara nevertheless?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] Above all, I warned against putting ourselves in a position of dependency vis-a-vis Turkey. There are politicians who were even opposed to protecting our external borders because they believe that the refugees should not be handled with violence. At the same time, they were prepared to pay Turkey to do precisely that. This was hypocritical. It is not morally better if Turkish rather than Greek police stop a refugee. To that extent, I do not oppose cooperation with Turkey or other countries. I believe that if we can do something ourselves, we should do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] The other EU member states want to strengthen cooperation with Turkey further. In any case, you are isolated in your demand to end the accession talks with Ankara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] I feel that the attitude of many EU politicians is dishonest. Most will say to me privately &quot;Turkey will never join the EU, nor do we want it to.&quot; At the same time, we are to deal with Turkey as if we would rather aim for accession sooner rather than later. I do not see Turkey as it stands in the EU. In recent years, Ankara has increasingly grown apart from Europe. This trend has increased dramatically in the last few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] You are not so harsh towards another country that is increasingly departing from democracy: Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] With Russia, the issue is not EU accession, but relations with an important neighbour. And just to clarify: There are actually sanctions against Russia and there are no EU accession talks. Nor should we forget that Russia annexed Crimea. However, dealing only with the question of responsibility fails to suffice. Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, there has been a return to the block mentality that we really thought had been overcome at the end of the Cold War. This is why at the beginning of the year, my first trip as OSCE chair will take me to Eastern Ukraine, Moscow, and Kyiv. We need to reverse this trend in our relations with Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] Does this also include easing EU sanctions against Moscow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] I agree with [German Foreign Minister] Frank-Walter Steinmeier's proposal of taking a more flexible position on the sanctions. We need a step-by-step approach. For every positive development in Ukraine, we should gradually ease the sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] This demand would earn you applause at the SPD [Social Democratic Party], but not at the Chancellery in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] It is not important who applauds or criticizes me. Unfortunately, the truth is that the peace process is not making any progress. Therefore, we must rebuild trust in Europe and use the sanctions to move away from a system of punishment to one of encouragement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Der Spiegel] Right-wing populist parties boast of their proximity to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. Do you want to try to constantly outdo the FPOe [Freedom Party of Austria], AfD [Alternative for Germany] or the Front National [in France]?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Kurz] No. My aim is not to jostle for proximity of any sort, but to find a positive solution to this crisis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">652 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A British lifeguard who volunteered to help rescue migrants and refugees in the Aegean sea has spoken of the harrowing moment he lifted month-old babies to safety and reassured their mothers they were alive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Heard, 32, from Hartland, Devon, has completed three missions to the Greek island of Lesbos to save lives on what he calls &quot;the front line&quot; of Europe's migration crisis, with hundreds attempting the crossing from Turkey to Greece every week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lifeguard dedicated around 14 weeks last year, initially going out at the beginning of 2016, returning in May to the south of the island and completing a two-month stint further north in Skala Sikamineas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As team leader on an old RNLI lifeboat, he has spent the time on call 24/7 responding to distress alerts and saving between 50-60 people at a time from 10m inflatable dinghies he describes as &quot;incredibly unsafe, incredibly unfit for the sea&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But more recently, the Refugee Rescue team have been conducting &quot;rock rescues&quot; - which involves patrolling secluded coves on the Lesbos coastline for small groups smuggled across in speedboats that stealthily zig-zag the usually-short route under the cover of darkness to avoid the authorities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Then they drop the refugees - if they're lucky - on to a nice sandy beach, but more often than not they just throw them in the water near the rocks and let the refugees swim the last few metres to Europe,&quot; he told the Press Association. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As soon as we find refugees we would then go through the tasks of having to get them, half the time back off the land because they're stuck in secluded coves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They throw them in really nasty places and the reason is these places are quiet, the authority's boats cant come in close to catch them, so its very, very dangerous for the refugees, especially at this time of year when it's getting very cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I was having to carry babies that were months old back into the water and out to the boat, numerous times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes in the dark, sometimes in daylight, freezing cold, and, as you can imagine, these people have just been through a massive ordeal, dropped on a strange coastline in the dark, their luggage, their phone - everything they own is either gone or soaked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're stranded and we are the first faces we see. The mothers are asking me if their babies are alive, if their babies are OK. Half of them think I am the authority and am going to send them back to Turkey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's a huge ordeal reassuring them, calming them down, getting them to trust you.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 7.5-metre metre boat called Mo Chara (&quot;my friend&quot; in Gaelic), has helped nearly 3,500 people to safety, working alongside another NGO Proactiva, the Hellenic coastguard, the EU border agency Frontex and Nato warships. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While many of the refugees the crew encountered were wearing life jackets, Mr Heard said these were fake, stuffed with foam packaging that soaks up sea water and loses its buoyancy within minutes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the migrants would buy them on market stalls in coastal towns after parting with thousands of pounds for a ticket to take them to Europe - &quot;another part of the atrocity that people are taking advantage of and cashing in on&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Every single boat or smuggler drop that we assisted there would be a good percentage of vulnerable people on them, whether they're elderly, disabled or injured, and every single boat would have infants or kids, families with children or tiny babies,&quot; he recalled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These dinghies are incredibly unsafe, incredibly unfit for the sea, and they are one of the main causes for the horrendous scenes we've seen - the drowning kids - these dinghies capsize, they become overwhelmed, deflate, their engines come off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a nutshell, the thing that gets me now is screaming, crying babies and women and children. If I hear that on television, if I think about it, it's not very nice. Pretty much every boat that we met had screaming kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of refugees in Greece are at risk of losing vital support as charities prepare to withdraw services from camps on the country's &quot;hotspot&quot; islands, as changes to EU funding are set to leave them out of contract by the end of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greek government will take over funding and managing support services to the camps on 31 July, but aid organisations fear the prospect of a &quot;humanitarian gap&quot; resulting from a poorly planned transition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the islands have received millions of euros from ECHO, the European Commission's humanitarian division, to provide services from laundry and clothing distribution to maritime rescue and child protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But officials confirmed this week that the way in which ECHO supports the response to the crisis is changing. As a result, the allocation of funding, as well as the selection of projects to be funded, will soon become the sole responsibility of the Greek authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reception facilities in the islands will be supported via the national programme,&quot; said a European Commission spokesperson. &quot;Funding channelled through the national programme is not managed directly by the Commission, but via the national authority responsible in Greece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said the situation is part of the process of &quot;moving from emergency response to a sustainable system&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Greek government will assume greater responsibilities and take over services which are presently provided by UNHCR and the broader humanitarian community,&quot; he said. &quot;UNHCR supports the government throughout this transition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the manner in which the proposed handover has been communicated has raised alarm, with some NGOs and local authorities relying on hearsay and rumours while others have received official instruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People just don't know what's going to happen,&quot; said Nicholas Millet of Be Aware and Share (BAAS), a Swiss NGO which oversees a school project on the island of Chios. &quot;There are no clear plans for handovers or transitions, the Government hasn't said what they're going to take over or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greek Migration Minister Yiannis Mouzalas recently described the current situation on the island as reaching breaking point, after a spate of problems including suicide attempts amongst the refugee population and violent attacks by far-right groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who's going to do child protection services on the island?&quot; said Millet. &quot;Who's going to do education? Who's going to do the food?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) currently runs two restaurants serving eight hundred meals three times a day to refugees on Chios. Director of NRC's Greek programme Gianmaria Pinto confirmed that the NGO would cease its operations there on the cut-off date, but that it would be prepared to resume services quickly if asked to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinto said the decision was communicated to NRC in mid March. &quot;The services we provide will keep running until July and then after that it's the government - through Greek NGOs, municipalities, whatever they decide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinto encouraged the national and local government to work with NGOs to ensure a safe transition. &quot;The municipality has to be informed and they have to start working. If they decide to hire a Greek NGO, fine. If they ask NRC to stay, we are ready to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for Save the Children confirmed that the organisation was also in the dark. &quot;We're still waiting for information about funding and operations on the islands,&quot; she said. &quot;It's unclear yet how camps and services for refugees and migrants will be managed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Chios island, two members of the municipal government confirmed this week that they had received no official communication from Athens regarding the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinto also said he feared for the future of the NRC's recently opened community centre. &quot;The day we opened we knew we would have to leave,&quot; he said. &quot;But it's becoming a humanitarian hub, lots of agencies use the space.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&eacute;decins du Monde (MDM) provide medical services on the island of Lesvos, which is home to over 4,000 refugees, according to UNHCR. Their operations in Moria, the island's state-run refugee camp, will stop at the end of May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the president of MDM in Greece, Nikitas Kanakis, the organisation was originally told by the Greek government in March that they would have to leave Moria by the end of April, after which they began reducing staff numbers on the island. Around a week later, Kanakis said, &quot;it was clear that they couldn't start. They couldn't find the people they needed and they needed more time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MDM were subsequently asked to remain on the island for another month. &quot;We want to help, but it's not easy, because we have announced to staff that their contract has finished. Now we have to ask them to return.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanakis said a team from the organisation would remain on the island to report on conditions and potential human rights violations within the camp, and expressed concern that vulnerable adults and children within the camp may fall through the cracks during the handover process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not an established team that will move from another place to there,&quot; he said. &quot;I have a lot of reasons to believe they won't find all the staff that they need. But hopefully they will do it. We are waiting to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a bad idea that the state will take over the camps,&quot; Kanakis added. &quot;The question is just how they will do it, and in a lot of cases they don't have the experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinto agreed that in terms of &quot;ownership and long-term sustainability&quot;, it was important to eventually return management of the islands to the national authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In theory this is a good step forward for the government,&quot; he said. &quot;In practice, though, what NRC doesn't want to see in August is humanitarian gaps. It's now the moment to boil down this political decision into an action plan. We still have time, the end of July is not tomorrow. But it's not very far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millet said the move had been a long time coming, but needed to be handled well. &quot;If the government is going to take over services they need to think about how they effectively transition over from the NGOs. We are supportive of the government to take over the services but we need to know how, and we'll support it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A counter rally will be held against a far-right group's plans to gather in Wishaw over Syrian refugees being offered homes with &quot;front and back gardens&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Scottish Defence League have confirmed they will hold their protest in the town on Saturday, April 15, at 2pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Wishaw to Calais have organised an event - Refugees Welcome, No to SDL event - starting at Wishaw Railway Station at 1.30pm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will clash with the SDL who will congregate there at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wishaw to Calais post on Facebook says: &quot;The SDL are planning to march on the town of Wishaw. Please turn up to PEACEFULLY show that Wishaw is a welcoming town, a town that stands shoulder to shoulder with refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSP Clare Adamson this week raised concerns with police over the SDL demo in Wishaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Motherwell and Wishaw MSP said that the far-right group's bid to &quot;sow hatred and division&quot; was not welcome.And she was worried about the rally's potential to distrupt the community and local businesses on Saturday, April 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Adamson told the Wishaw Press: &quot;The racist, narrow-minded attitudes of this tiny fringe group are not welcome in Wishaw - and local residents will be appalled at their attempt to sow hatred and division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have contacted the police regarding my concerns about disruption to the community and impact on businesses. I will receive a full briefing from the police the week of the intended protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that most Wishaw residents will warmly welcome refugees to our community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motherwell and Wishaw MP Marion Fellows said: &quot;I was delighted and proud to see so many local people take to Wishaw Main Street in order to make clear that our new Syrian neighbours are more than welcome in our town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that we as a community continue to show that spirit of welcoming and friendliness going forward as the refugees settle into their new lives in Wishaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also important that we stand firm in rejecting any attempts by the vile SDL, and the other far-right groups, to create division in our society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week community activist Martine Nolan organised the rally to show SDL's message of hate would not be welcomed.She said: &quot;We will not let hatred divide us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that of the 12 families who have arrived in the town, only four had been given houses, the other eight had been given flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirming the date to march in the town, a SDL spokesman told the Wishaw Press &quot;That's the date 100 per cent confirmed for the Wishaw demo on April 15 at 2pm, muster at the train station at 1.30pm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he added: &quot;We now know that they (Syrian refugees) are getting three-bedroom houses with front and back gardens. We have pictures to prove it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Locals who live in flats in the same street and who have waited over 10 years to get similar houses sent us pictures of them sitting in their front garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Believe us we have lots of support for this demo. Locals are understandably angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the day we will be well behaved and it will be a peaceful protest, as all our events are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can assure you any trouble on the day will come from our left-wing fascist opposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the SDL march has been slammed by politicians, community groups and residents in Wishaw who don't welcome them in the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And bikers across Scotland have vowed to descend on the town to oppose the SDL march</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group called Stand Up To The Racist SDL in Wishaw by bikers against fascism will hold their rally on Saturday, April 15, from noon to 3pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Facebook post for the group said: &quot;The SDL are protesting in Wishaw this April 15 and we cannot let this go unopposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All bikers are welcome to protest this as many did in Alloa a few weeks ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unite Against Fascism (UAF) said the SDL intend to stir up racism in a town that has repeatedly shown their support to welcome refugees and have urged people to support a counter protest and show that Wishaw does not tolerate racism or attempts by fascists to take to its streets and sow division in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McFadden, UAF Scotland's spokesman said: &quot;Scotland's communities have always provided magnificent support to refugees, recognising that they are fleeing war, persecution and oppression. Wishaw stands tall in embracing this welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is appalling that the hate-filled, sieg-heil saluting fascists of the SDL are threatening to impose themselves on the people of Wishaw in a brazen attempt to intimidate refugees and whip up racial hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We encourage anti-fascists to demonstrate their support for refugees and our vibrant and diverse communities. The tiny minority of wandering fascists must be left in no doubt that their vile views shall never be tolerated or go unchallenged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A council spokesman said: &quot;There is no requirement for any organisation to seek permission from the council to hold a static rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We work closely with our partners at Police Scotland to ensure community safety at all times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Police Scotland spokesman said: &quot;We are aware of this event and it will be policed appropriately.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump has committed to honour the deal with Australia to take refugees from Manus and Nauru - even as his ban against refugees and migrants from some Muslim-majority countries is enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 25-minute phone call with Malcolm Turnbull, the two leaders committed to work together to improve global instability, defeat Islamic State (Isis sometimes referred to as Isil) and prevent irregular and illegal immigration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ongoing shared objective to defeat Isil was discussed and both leaders committed to continuing to work together to improve global instability, including in the Asia Pacific,&quot; a spokeswoman for the prime minister said. &quot;The leaders acknowledged a common interest in preventing irregular and illegal migration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president confirmed that his administration would continue to honour the 2016 refugee resettlement arrangement agreed between the governments of Australia and the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly afterwards, the White House tweeted a photo of the call and released a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both leaders emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally,&quot; the White House statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's executive order to close America's borders to travellers from some Muslim-majority countries left people from those countries held in detention at New York City's JFK airport on Saturday, causing chaos in American airports over the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Australia's refugee deal in jeopardy after Trump's 'extreme vetting' order</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Australia's trade minister, Steve Ciobo, said he would not support a Trump-style ban and nor would most Australians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he would like Australia to implement a similar policy, Ciobo said he would not personally support such a ban and &quot;it is not a position that most Australians will support&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ciobo said since the Coalition stopped asylum seeker boats, the government had been able to apply more rigour and focus on the people applying to come to Australia as refugees.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australians I believe, fundamentally want to know that as a country we are going to be safe,&quot; he told Sky News. &quot;They want to know that we are not going to allow terrorists into Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the prime minister and opposition leader will address the National Press Club to outline their parties' agendas for the year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, Tony Abbott has continued to push the leadership, calling for Turnbull to adopt a constitutional referendum to change the Senate processes to allow governments to pass legislation or risk resembling Italy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over time the Senate has ceased being a house of review and become a house of rejection,&quot; Abbott told the Australian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is preparing a major speech on the issue this week - one sure to blow a hole in a week set down by the Coalition to lay out its agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ciobo agreed the Senate had been frustrating from time to time but did not appear to back Abbott's idea. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact is under this prime minister and this government we have been able to secure passage of key legislation through the Australian parliament, we've worked constructively and engaged in a meaningful way with the crossbench,&quot; Ciobo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ciobo was also asked about Trump's executive ruling to stop funding to NGOs who provide abortion advice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former pacific minister described Australia's aid program as very effective and said the government needed to be respectful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People across China are lighting incense sticks and praying at temples to wish for an auspicious start to the Lunar New Year. Thousands of people have visited Beijing's major temples, as today is the first day of the Year of the Rooster.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Milan judge has ordered former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi to be tried on corruption charges. Judge Carlo Ottone De Marchi ordered the trial to begin on April 5 in Milan, said Italian news agency ANSA. Milan daily Corriere della Sera said the former three-time premier is accused of having shelled out some 10 million euros (&pound;7.97m), plus expensive gifts, to 20 young women who attended sexy parties at his Arcore villa near Milan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Berlusconi's lawyers deny any wrongdoing by their client, saying he is being tried for his &quot;generosity&quot; to the women.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Mongolians stood in frigid weather Saturday for the second time this winter to protest the government response to smog that routinely blankets their capital. An estimated 7,000 people, many of them wearing air masks and gas masks underneath thick winter hats, braved temperatures that fell below minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). Standing in the city's central Sukhbataar Square, they held black balloons and protest signs. One banner read: &quot;Wake up and smell the smog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ulaanbaatar is one of the world's coldest capitals, and more than half of the city's 1.3 million residents rely on burning raw coal, plastic, rubber tires and other materials to stay warm and cook meals in their homes. In impoverished neighborhoods that ring the city, known as ger districts, many herders and others live in traditional round tents without heating, leaving them to burn polluting fuels. Pollution readings in one ger district Friday were at times nearly 30 times above the levels considered safe by the World Health Organization. Icy winds that whipped through the square during Saturday's protest cleared some of the previous day's pollution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory ministers are quietly ending a scheme to move stranded child refugees to Britain after accepting just 350 of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number is barely a tenth of the 3,000 demanded by 84-year-old peer Lord Dubs, who fled the Nazis to Britain as a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Dubswon a victory last yearwhen he amended the Immigration Act, forcing Britain to accept unaccompanied child refugees who had already made the dangerous crossing to Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until then the government was taking refugee children with family in Britain, or from camps near warzones - leaving many stranded in the Calais Jungle camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron finally U-turns on bid to accept stranded child refugees who've reached Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a bid to help 3,000 children under the so-called Dubs amendment was downgraded to a &quot;specified number&quot; after government pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today ministers revealed that &quot;specified number&quot; is just 350 - and 200 of those children have arrived in Britain already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alf Dubs told the Mirror the Government had acted &quot;shoddily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am bitterly disappointed. The Government has decided to close down the scheme without any notification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The statement was put out just after Prime Minister's questions and when theBrexitvotes were carrying on. It is shoddy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was in a camp in Greece last week and the situation was absolutely dire. We shouldn't be closing the door on these kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commons Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: &quot;To close the programme that helps lone child refugees after helping only 350 children is completely wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a time when President Trump is trying to close down refugee programmes altogether, the British Government should not be closing the very programme designed to help the most vulnerable refugees of all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: &quot;The government has done the bare minimum, helping only a tiny number of youngsters and appearing to end the programme while thousands still suffer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is a betrayal of these vulnerable children and a betrayal of British values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said: &quot;This announcement, which the Tories have tried to sneak out just before recess, is an absolute disgrace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is nowhere near the 3,000 originally proposed by Lord Dubs and it equates to less than one per local authority in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef's Lily Caprani said the charity was &quot;disappointed&quot;, adding: &quot;Thousands of these children arrived alone and are highly vulnerable, living in a state of perpetual uncertainty and at risk of exploitation and abuse by traffickers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration minister Robert Goodwill's announcement was buried in a 1,300-word written statement with no opportunity to MPs to interrogate him in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Goodwill said councils had said they had capacity to accept 400 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children up to the end of March 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He insisted more than 4,400 other people, half of them children, had already been accepted under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme - with a target to take 20,000 by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 3,000 children and families from the Middle East and North Africa by 2020 will be taken under the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Downing Street spokesman said: &quot;We are working with councils, but we have to recognise that lots of these children who are transferred under this scheme have very pressing and difficult needs and there is a limit to the capacity for local authorities to provide that level of care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Britain accept more unaccompanied child refugees?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian refugee - erroneously sent as a child to the adult men's only Manus Island detention centre - has fled Papua New Guinea after more than three years to seek asylum in Fiji.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahwazi Arab Loghman Sawari, who was 17 when Australia mistakenly sent him to the men's detention centre, said he was left homeless and destitute by Australian and PNG authorities, was beaten by guards, left without medical treatment and abused during more than three years within Australia's offshore processing regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over months in PNG's capital, Port Moresby, Sawari was able to save money - and borrow some from several sources - for a plane ticket and used false papers to board a flight bound for Suva, landing late last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is currently staying with a family in Fiji and will seek asylum in that country. Fiji is a party to the refugees convention and Sawari has already been granted refugee status during his time in PNG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  A life in limbo: the refugees who fled torture only to end up trapped indefinitely on Manus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawari spoke to the Guardian from Suva, saying he had been welcomed and that a family member had given him accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told my story to them and they wanted to help me,&quot; he said. &quot;They said, 'What we can do, we will do for you.' The people here have made me feel safe. I was never, not for one day, safe in PNG.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawari said he would formally apply for protection from the Fijian government this week, saying he faced persecution in PNG and that he could not live safely there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawari had visited the Fiji high commission in Port Moresby after researching the country online but was told they could not help him from the diplomatic outpost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I have reached Fiji now and I will tell them my story,&quot; he said. &quot;I have nothing to hide, I have done nothing wrong. I have only wanted freedom. I need freedom, I need to be safe wherever I live. If Fiji say, 'Yes, you can be safe here,' I will be very happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sawari said that, despite reaching Fiji, he did not feel he had escaped offshore detention entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not feel safe from Australia or PNG,&quot; he said. &quot;I fear they will come get me and take me back. I cannot go back to those countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawari said his time under Australia's offshore detention policy had been marked by violence and deprivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawari fled Iran after his two brothers were imprisoned and tortured by the country's theocratic regime and a cousin was publicly hanged for his opposition to the government. Sawari carries a picture with him of his defiant relative kissing the hangman's rope as it is fastened around his neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawari was 17 years old when Australia forcibly removed him to Manus Island, where he was placed in the adult men's-only detention centre. He was sent to Manus despite carrying a photocopy of his national identity document that showed his birthdate and telling immigration officials he was under 18.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognised as a refugee and moved to Manus's secondary detention camp, the East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre, Sawari was allegedly assaulted by a guard when he asked for more washing powder. The guard punched him to the ground and Sawari required hospitalisation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     An attempt to resettle Sawari in Lae, one of PNG's most dangerous cities, collapsed after he was forced out of his accommodation and lost his job after a dispute with a housemate he says was motivated by his refugee status. Sawari ended up homeless and was forced to sleep on the steps of the police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawari tried to return to detention but was refused, and had spent the past few months living in Port Moresby, where he said he felt in constant danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That place is not safe for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I was in danger every day. And my situation is the same for everyone in detention on Manus and Nauru. My voice is speaking for all of them, we are not safe there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian first met Sawari on Manus Island in 2015. During that meeting, he repeated constantly, almost like a mantra, that he sought only freedom.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers, used to false alarms over local fishermen, started to relax, making cups of coffee and snacking on biscuits until they could get back to work. But then the gunfire started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Hargreaves, the </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bourbon Argos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s British deck manager, described how the chartered ship's crew ran downstairs from the bridge shouting: &quot;Shooting! Shooting!&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff fled to a fortified room below decks as the unidentified gunmen boarded the ship. Some sat down to write letters to their families, fearing the messages could be their last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't know who they were, why they were here and what they were going to do,&quot; Mr Hargreaves said, recounting the &quot;traumatic&quot; two hours before staff got the all-clear to venture out from their hiding place.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was largely empty, and no one was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The armed men left without removing anything from the ship, sparking fervent speculation over whether they may have been from one of the numerous armed groups fighting in the continuing Libyan civil war or even Isis, which controls part of the country's coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they were revealed to be from the Libyan coastguard - a supposed ally of Britain in the EU in the ongoing refugee crisis - which claimed staff mistook MSF for a gang of oil smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack on the </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bourbon Argos </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is among several serious incidents involving the force, which is accused of shooting, beating and torturing refugees trying to reach safety in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One charity had one of its rescue boats confiscated and the German volunteers on board detained, while another organisation is pursuing a legal case against the Libyan coastguard for allegedly causing the deaths of up to 25 migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruben Neugebauer, from Sea-Watch, said the German charity is attempting to launch legal action over the incident on 21 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Libyan coastguard interrupted an ongoing rescue operation, cutting off the charity's boat as it handed out life jackets to around 150 people on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of them boarded the refugee boat and he was hitting them with an object we can't define,&quot; Mr Neugebauer said. In the ensuing panic, up to 25 refugees are believed to have fallen into the sea and drowned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day rescuing refugees from the Mediterranean Sea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea-Watch was only able to pull four unconscious people from the water, with distraught staff salvaging four dead bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a feeling it was an attempt to push back this vessel because there was no other reason for them to interfere with our rescue,&quot; Mr Neugebauer said. &quot;I'm sure that no one would have died if we had been able to carry on handing out life jackets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Libyan Navy representative told local television the Sea-Watch boat was not &quot;attacked&quot; but admitted there was an incident, claiming the boat was in Libyan waters - an allegation denied by the charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Libyan coastguard is known to have forcibly returned thousands of migrants caught attempting to flee the country to land, with asylum seekers describing being beaten and tortured at detention camps where they are kept in horrific conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights found that migrants were being imprisoned, robbed, raped and subjected to force labour after &quot;dangerous, life-threatening interceptions&quot; by the Libyan coastguard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 17-year-old boy from Guinea told the UN the coastguard &quot;shot at migrants randomly&quot; when his boat was intercepted in March, killing at least three people dead and injuring several more.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the horrific account is not an isolated one. Abdurrahman, a 23-year-old Eritrean man, told Amnesty International he was among asylum seekers beaten with hoses and wooden sticks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's mission in Libya also says it has received reports indicating some members of the coastguard &quot;have worked with armed groups, smugglers and traffickers to exploit migrants for profit&quot;, as well as selling on the engines of seized migrant boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is urging Britain and other countries training the Libyan coastguard to ensure its &quot;human rights component is comprehensive&quot; and that migrants are protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International warned that the EU's expanding cooperation with Libya risks &quot;fuelling rampant ill-treatment&quot; and violations of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Europe shouldn't even think about migration cooperation arrangements with Libya if it results, directly or indirectly, in such shocking human rights violations,&quot; said Magdalena Mughrabi, the group's interim deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it was backing &quot;legitimate Libyan authorities&quot; to develop their capacity at sea but had no direct involvement in coastguard operations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The EU's programme of capacity delivery to the Libyan coastguard places particular emphasis on humanitarian and migration issues, as well as on women's rights issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked under what circumstances the support would stop, she said the EU was ensuring &quot;correct standards are maintained&quot;, without providing details.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guards shot in the air to warn them but because our boat is small and was swaying due to heavy waves there might have been a hit to their boat,&quot; he said. &quot;I confirm that it was not directly targeted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Defence is aware of the reported attacks but is understood not to be leading investigations into alleged abuses as it continues its training programme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alkhalaf said he can't return to Turkey after renouncing his temporary residency status there.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returning to Syria, where the Sunni Muslim family lived just outside the battle-scarred city of Aleppo, also isn't an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There is nothing left in Syria for us. Our home is destroyed; the government is out to get us,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I've got nowhere to go if the US doesn't want me.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father and son have been living among a rotating group of Muslim families since their arrival in June 2015 on a medical visa for Ahmad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alkhalaf works as a security guard at a mosque after receiving his work permit in July. He hopes to take his driver's license exam soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emotional strain of separation has taken its toll on the family, Alkhalaf said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His youngest son in Turkey has developed asthma-like problems, his wife is being treated for high blood pressure and Ahmad doesn't always sleep well, a problem that started with night terrors following the bomb blasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Emotionally, I'm drained,' Alkhalaf said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If we were all together, I think a lot of us would feel better. It's half the battle.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmad talks with his mother often and knows she's struggling to provide for his siblings.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family largely lives off the charity of the Muslim community in New England and what Alkhalaf can send from his wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmad said he tries to perk his mother up by telling her about the new things he's experiencing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I try to make her happy, but it's hard,' Ahmad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He enrolled in the fourth grade this past fall at a school in the Boston suburbs.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is awaiting a more advanced pair of prosthetic arms.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he hopes to join a soccer team this spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials at Heights Elementary say Ahmad's stresses haven't appeared to affect his schooling.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anything, they say, they're impressed with how quickly he has embraced his new environment, where he is receiving physical and occupational therapy, one-on-one reading and math help and other support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He really wants to talk to people and understand things on many levels,' said Holly Geiger, Ahmad's teacher.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He's not shy, and I think that's helped.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters have purposely jam-packed Ahmad's schedule, said Nabil Jalal, a Sharon resident who is among those helping Ahmad and his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Ahmad ran off to join an arts and craft session, Jalal worried what the new year might bring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You can't have one parent and not the other, no matter how good the life is here,' Jalal said. 'There's a big missing part.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the Forensic Oceanography department at Goldsmiths, University of London, rejected a &quot;toxic narrative&quot;seeking to blame NGOs for the worsening crisis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">report's author, Lorenzo Pezzani, said: &quot;The evidence simply does not support the idea that rescues by NGOs are to blame for an increase in migrants crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The argument against NGOs deliberately ignores the worsening economic and political crisis across several regions in Africa that has driven up the numbers of crossings in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The violence against migrants in Libya is so extreme that they attempt the sea crossing with or without search and rescue being available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desperate journeys: Rescued at sea, refugees detail abuse in Libya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has documented &quot;slave auctions&quot; where African migrants are openly bought and sold in the war-torn country, as well as endemic rates of rape, abuse, torture and forced labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the dire situation, the EU has been giving funding, training and equipment to the Libyan coastguard in efforts to turn back migrant boats and preventthe crossings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian groups, which have documented the coastguard abusing migrants and attacking their ships, say forcing refugees from international waters back into Libya is a violation of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasing co-operation with Libya's fragile Government of National Accordhas coincided with record crossings and deaths in the Central Mediterranean, where almost 1,800 refugees have lost their lives so far this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers found no evidence that the rocketing figures -181,500 migrants wererescued and taken to Italy in 2016 -were caused by humanitarian search-and-rescue missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Frontex recognised, the increase was consistent with previous year-on-year trends of increasing crossings by African migrants, which cannot be attributed to the presence of search-and-rescue NGOs... who stepped in after the EU and its member states pulled out in late 2014,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence, it pointed to increased migrant boats on routes that were not patrolled by rescue ships, including a 46 per cent spike in crossings from Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also examined accusations that rescue groups are &quot;helping criminals&quot;, finding no evidence of the allegations after reviewing official documents, statistics, qualitative interviews, photographs and maps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right-wing groups have seized on unsubstantiated claims made by a prosecutor in Sicily that NGOs were &quot;colluding&quot; with criminal gangs and allegedly making phone calls to Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian parliament has also launched a fact-finding mission into the issue, which is hearing evidence from law-enforcement agencies and aid workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusations having resulted in efforts by the French far-right group G&eacute;n&eacute;ration Identitaire to raise thousands of pounds for their own ship to intercept refugee rescues and stop a supposed &quot;invasion by enemies and criminals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trial run off the coast of Sicily last month disrupted a rescue ship until Italian authorities, who deploy rescue ships on their operations, intervened and drove the anti-immigrationactivists off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez set up a crowdfunding counter-campaign that has so far raised more than &pound;70,000 for M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res(MSF), which runs two rescue ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers also dismissed claims thatNGOs were causing smugglers to switch from wooden vessels to flimsy rubber dinghies that areincapable of reaching Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They found that tactics used by gangs profiting from the lucrative human trade have worsened steadily since the outbreak of Libya's civil war, when the UK was among the countries backing the removal of dictator Muammar Gaddafi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Barack Obama described the ensuing chaos as a &quot;sh*t show&quot;, seeing rival governments and countless armed groups including Isis rush into the power vacuum, where they are still battling for control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Goldsmiths report also placed partial blame on the EU's Operation Sophia mission, which had a &quot;major impact on smugglers' tactics&quot; by intercepting and destroying larger and safer wooden boats.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europol hails 'success' in combating people smuggling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Libyan coastguard's use of violence when intercepting vessels also affected smugglers' tactics and at times led to boats capsizing, endangering everyone on board,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It concluded that those blaming NGOs are choosing to ignore the role other actors, including EU agencies and national governments, have played in making migrant crossings more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that the toxic narrative falsely claiming that NGO search and rescue is to blame for the migrant crossing situation is part of a worrying tendency to criminalise solidarity initiatives towards migrants,&quot; Mr Pezzani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also a convenient distraction, as it diverts attention from the failures of the states involved to deal with the real issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One has to ask: why is there such a gap in search-and-rescue activities in the first place that makes NGO rescues so essential?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Heller, another researcher from Goldsmiths, said if mounting pressure and far-right campaigns stopped humanitarian operations in the Mediterranean Sea, &quot;many more&quot; refugees would die on the crossing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crew of Jugend Rettet's Iuventa rescue ship photographed what appears to be a Libyan coastguard officer pointing a weapon at refugees (far right) (Jugend Rettet)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is precisely what happened when attacks led to the ending of the Italian Mare Nostrum operation in 2014,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities have previously rejected claims of collusion with smugglers as &quot;baseless&quot;, while calling for the EU to provide safe and legal routes for refugees to reach safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stefano Argenziano, MSF's operations manager for migration, said: &quot;The real problem is that people are dying. There's a gap in assistance and we're starting to wonder whether this is part of a deliberate plan to step the migration flow... a deadly deterrent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Oxford University study also found rescues have &quot;little or no effect on the number of arrivals&quot;, while research by the Unravelling the Mediterranean Migration Crisisproject found European policy on the refuge crisis had been an &quot;absolute failure&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sophie Beau, the co-founder of rescue charity SOS Mediterranee, said NGOs were being forced to act by the &quot;failure of European states&quot;, who should be increasing capacity themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NGOs are being blamed for our presence, when authorities should be blamed for their absence,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a humanitarian tragedy unfolding in front of our eyes at the door of Europe and we cannot just remain blind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 61,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year and 7,600 in Greece, mostly from Nigeria, Bangladesh, Syria and sub-Saharan African nations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My family and I arrived in Britain in 1978, when I was just nine. Like the parents of Salman Abedi, the perpetrator of Monday's barbaric attack on Manchester Arena, who fled Gaddafi's Libya for the UK, we were refugees from a murderous dictatorship which was hell-bent on persecuting its opponents and consolidating its power by force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my case, we were escaping the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. My parents were told that Hussein's thugs were about to arrest them, their only crime being that they were Kurdish, so we packed our bags and fled Baghdad for Britain www.overnight.No doubt like Abedi's parents too, we were greeted by the UK with warmth and seemingly endless opportunities. I was provided with the chance to go to university, to found a business and ultimately to become a member of Parliament. I owe everything to the open-mindedness, generosity and fairness of Britain and its people, and I am profoundly grateful.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My experience is not unusual. Refugees come here for many reasons, but they all come to a country whose inherent values are about protecting the vulnerable, and giving everyone, no matter who they are or where they come from, the freedom and the opportunity to prosper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why I am a proud British citizen, why all refugees should feel lucky to be allowed to start a new life in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also another reason why Abedi's appalling crimes are so outrageous, the betrayal of his country so sickening. As the child of refugees, his family had been welcomed. And yet, instead of embracing everything that Britain had to offer, he saw the normality of British life, the innocent excitement and happiness of young children and their parents attending a concert by their favourite singer, and decided to bring it all to a terrible end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement released by Daesh claiming responsibility referenced &quot;foreign wars&quot; as an explanation for the attack, and Jeremy Corbyn has shamefully seized on this to support his own naive world view, where the West is to blame for every outrage perpetrated against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more revealing was how Daesh described the parents and children murdered: as &quot;crusaders&quot; attending a &quot;shameless concert arena&quot;. The simple truth is that Abedi hated all of us because of the way we live, the values we hold, and the freedoms we enjoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of how Abedi was radicalised and who he was trained by will continue to emerge; and how we can combat the indoctrination of young Muslims will be endlessly debated. But we shouldn't ignore how extraordinary it is that Abedi could be so ungrateful, so ignorant of what our country has really given him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's intervention in his parents' home country was no justification, of course. It is believed that Abedi's family returned to Libya when Gaddafi was overthrown by the rebels in 2011, after Britain stepped in to stop hundreds of thousands being murdered, as the tyrant's army marched on Benghazi, pledging to wipe out all of those who protested against his dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How utterly misguided it would be to blame an intervention to preserve life in Libya, requested by the Arab League and backed by the United Nations, for this terrible act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also cannot understand why some politicians seek to explain away Abedi's crimes as somehow a consequence of our own failures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All I can see is an honourable country, providing refuge and the chance to build a new life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is right to review security arrangements at major events and potential targets in light of the events in Manchester, and we must take the necessary steps to ensure that everyone is as safe as possible when going about their daily lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our security services and our police are outstanding public servants, and are truly the best of British - if they say they need more support then we should provide it. However, I still believe we should do nothing to fundamentally change the great country that we are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should always prioritise safety, but we should continue to give our children the freedom to express and enjoy themselves. We should continue to remain united, as Manchester has demonstrated in the aftermath of this terrorist attack. We should continue to give everyone lucky enough to be part of our country the welcome that we always have done, no matter where they're from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we should continue to expect those we take in to be thankful for it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is one thing to refuse to confront a President for appalling policy - but it's another to follow his lead. This year we have watched in horror as Trump's America, with its Mexican wall and Muslim ban, turns in on itself - yet under our noses Britain risks marching down a similar path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than providing more resources in Calais to process refugee claims, Theresa May announced instead that our flagship response to the crisis on our doorstep would be to build our own &pound;2m wall of shame. Then we saw the handful of child refugees we did bring to the UK splashed across our front pages and examined by dentists as age checks were demanded and their legitimacy questioned. The Government did little to challenge the false stereotyping of children fleeing conflict and suffering from post-traumatic stress, and instead seeming more intent on turning our school gates and A&amp;E departments into border checkpoints.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday the Government's record sank even lower as it was revealed that Britain will turn its back on some of the most vulnerable people in the world - lone child refugees. Despite saying we could take in up to 3,000 children in Europe fleeing persecution and war, we couldn't even find room in our communities for less than two in every upper tier and unitary local authority in the country. By the time the extra children have been brought to the UK we will have given refuge to just 350 under the Dubs scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compare this to the scale of the tragedy. Last year 500 people died while trying to reach Europe. In Syria alone seven million people have been displaced while one million are applying for asylum in Europe. Last year, 30,000 unaccompanied children arrived in Greece and Italy. As the fifth richest country in the world, can we really only find room for 350 of their children? The Government should have been doing everything possible to help local authorities to house these children, but instead they've cancelled the scheme altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The abandoning of these children is not an isolated incident. In fact it fits with a hard line narrative that Theresa May has been pursuing since becoming PM. We have a Prime Minister so intent on pulling up the drawbridge that she is willing to sacrifice our environmental protections and economic security on the altar of ending freedom of movement. After a divisive EU referendum campaign we've seen toxic rhetoric from our own Government blaming a whole host of problems on EU nationals - from the crisis facing the NHS to the shortage of affordable housing. This despite the fact that with 100,000 people from other EU countries employed by the NHS, they are more likely to be dressing our wounds or building our houses than standing in front of us in the queue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helps tackle refugee crisis in Greece</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government's aim couldn't be clearer: by refusing to give an early guarantee to EU citizens of their right to stay here, by blaming migrants for Britain's problems and, now, ending the refugee children's scheme, they are colluding with those who say that people from abroad simply are not welcome here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is a bigger country than this. We should be stepping up as a world leader in welcoming refugees, not stepping away at their time of need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, people here have already taken things into their own hands, opening their homes to refugees and going to Calais to help in any way they can. We have both seen first-hand the compassion of volunteers moved to act where the Government has failed. On visits to Calais last year we saw how simple ticketing systems can be used to distribute donations which UK citizens, unable to make it to the camps themselves, have been quick to give.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on these visits, while the presence of British volunteers was striking, so was the absence of British officials. Sadly it seems to be becoming clearer now why - our Government has no intention of offering any meaningful help in the way its citizens have.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The backlash against Donald Trump 's immigration &nbsp;crackdown intensified today after it emerged that Olympic hero Sir Mo Farah could be banned from returning to his home in the US.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President signed an executive order on Friday which prevents any citizen of seven mostly-Muslim countries from entering the US for 90 days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those countries is Somalia, the birthplace of Sir Mo Farah, Britain's most successful athlete with double Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-distance runner, who lives with his family in Oregon, is believed to be training in Ethiopia at the moment and there are fears he could be cut-off from his wife and daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sudden ban has affected dozens of other British residents, many of whom have been trapped in transit, unable to fly to the US.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman affected was&nbsp;Hamaseh Tayari, a UK resident with an Iranian passport, who is stranded in Costa Rica after being denied boarding a flight home to Glasgow because her return flight was due to stop-over in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The distraught vet, who was on holiday with her boyfriend, said: 'This has shocked me. We just discovered [what Trump did] at the airport when we went to check in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I want people to know this isn't just happening to refugees. I am a graduate and have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and pays tax.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraqi-born Nadhim Zahawi, Tory MP for Stratford-on-Avon, is also banned from the US.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the BBC: 'I haven't felt discriminated against since little school.' He demanded the PM stand up to Mr Trump and not 'look away'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May was forced to make a dramatic U-turn to condemn Mr Trump's ban after she refused three times to criticise the move yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister's about-turn came after she faced mutiny from within the Tory party and one of her MPs revealed the ban on entering the US applies to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Wollaston, another senior Tory MP, said Mr Trump should be barred from making the usual address to Parliament when he visits the UK later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a sign of the anger against and Tory MP Heidi Allen tweeted directly at Mrs May saying: 'Strong leadership means not being afraid to tell someone powerful when they're wrong. It's an ethos this country is proud of.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last night Downing Street issued a statement saying she does 'not agree' with the refugee ban and will make representations if it affects Britons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban also affects those with dual nationality, who were born in one of the seven countries, returning to the USA if they are currently away.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement that the State Department is due to release, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the 90-day visa moratorium extends beyond just citizens of Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also applies to people who originally hail from those countries but are traveling on a passport issued by any other nation, the statement notes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Mo is originally from Somalia and moved to the UK when he was eight-years-old.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he was born in one of the countries President Trump has targeted, travelling on a British passport will not help him return home.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Tayari was due to fly home to Glasgow via New York after holidaying in Costa Rica but her US transit visa was revoked as Mr Trump's immigration crackdown took effect immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is now trying to work out an alternative route home but she said it is likely to cost her a month's salary to get home.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This has really shocked me. We just discovered [what Trump did] at the airport when we went to check-in,&nbsp;Ms Tayari told the Guardian.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I want people to know that this is not just happening to refugees. I am a graduate and I have a Phd. It has happened to a person who is working and who pays tax.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement from the State Department means Iraqis seeking to enter the U.S. on a British passport, for instance, will be barred, according to a U.S. official. British citizens don't normally require a visa to enter the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Travelers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa,' the statement said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or non-immigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period. Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump defended his tough new immigration bans, and&nbsp;denied that his executive order, which bars refugees and citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US, was a Muslim ban.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Conservative MP also tweeted to say he is banned from the USA under President Trump's controversial ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadhim Zahawi represents Stratford-on-Avon but both he and his wife were born in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tweeted: 'I'm a British citizen &amp; so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear ill [sic] be banned from the USA based on my country of birth.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: 'Had confirmation that the order does apply to myself and my wife as we were both born in Iraq. Even if we are not dual Nat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A sad sad day to feel like a second class citizen! Sad day for the USA.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban has also already affected an Iranian director nominated for an Oscar, who now won't be able to attend the Hollywood award ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asghar Farhadi is nominated in the best foreign film category for his movie The Salesman but there are fears he may now not be able to attend next month's Academy Awards, because he was born in Iran.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian-born actress who stars in Farhadi's The Salesman vowed to boycott the Oscars over Trump's immigration bans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taraneh Alidoosti, the 33-year-old known as the Natalie Portman of Iran, took to Twitter with a message for fans on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest,' she tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian-born Hessam Noorian, who has a British passport and a US Green Card was held at Chicago airport for five hours as he tried to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they asked him several questions, and searched his backpack and possessions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ANTI-IMMIGRATION ORDER DO?&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban refugee entries from all countries for 120 days. Refugees can be accepted on case-by-case basis, including&nbsp;if they are a religious minority facing religious persecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Block refugee entries from Syria indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap refugee intake at 50,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban visa and immigration entries for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries on banned list, including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspend visa issuance to countries of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has an Iranian passport and a British passport, and was told possession of the Iranian passport necessitated the questions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took five hours to receive a waiver, he told the Chicago Tribune. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven refugees bound for the U.S. were stopped from boarding a plane in Cairo on Saturday and 12 migrants were detained in New York overnight because they arrived just after the executive order was signed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqi refugees who was detained for 14 hours at New York, was released on Saturday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 53-year-old had arrived in America on a flight from Istanbul on Friday night, just hours after Trump implemented the immigration ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had worked for the U.S. government in Iraq for 10 years as a translator, engineer and contractor and had a valid special immigration visa to relocate to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dual-citizenship ban doesn't apply to U.S. citizens who are also citizens of the seven nations singled out by Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department statement also said such restrictions don't apply to people from those countries traveling on diplomatic visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. consulate in Erbil have stopped accepting visa applications from Iraqi nationals until further notice, except for certain diplomatic exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The urgent steps come as State Department officials try to sort out how to implement Mr. Trump's broadly-worded policy executive order. Officials said they received little information about the ban before it took effect from the Trump team.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One described how a draft of the order was brought in unofficially to the State Department earlier this week to review before it took effect.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, Theresa May repeatedly refused to criticise President Trump's executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At&nbsp;a news conference in Ankara, Prime Minister May said: 'The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.&nbsp;The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom's policy on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And our policy on refugees is to have a number of voluntary schemes to bring Syrian refugees into the country, particularly those who are most vulnerable but also to provide significant financial contributions to support refugees in countries surrounding Syria.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday evening, a Downing St spokesman said&nbsp;Theresa May does 'not agree' with Donald Trump's refugee ban and will make representations if it hits Britons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However just yards away from her, Prime Minister Yildirim was putting the boot in, saying building walls would not help the refugee crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: 'We cannot solve this refugee problem by putting up walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We opened our doors, and if they come again, we would take them again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Regional problems cannot be solved by sweeping them under the carpet.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: 'British citizens banned from the US and our government has nothing to say? Disgrace.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Mirror, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: 'Not only is this shocking even by her standards, it cannot be allowed to stand. The President's actions have horrified the world, and this is a moment when she has to show what side she is on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At the press conference she contrived to make the Turkish government look liberal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They said it was wrong to build walls. Rather than fighting to build a world that is open, tolerant and united, Theresa May is dividing the world in a very dangerous way.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's order&nbsp;declares that U.S. policy is&nbsp;'to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also&nbsp;gives Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing the president with the names of other countries to add to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will limit the total refugee resettlement numbers to 50,000 per year, according to the order.</SPAN></P>
